I have used this product for a decent amount of time and had no issue until today, when the cable burned my hand when I went to pick it up today.  It was enough to melt the plastic on it as I could smell it burning.  I quickly unplugged the cable, and to make sure it wasn't the USB port I plugged it into I plugged in other cables, all to no reaction, however when I re-plugged this cable in another USB port, it quickly began heating.  I don't know if it's the manufacturer's fault, but I figured I needed to warn people that this is possible.

11,1.0,"After playing Dirt, I could hardly wait to get into this game.
I prefer realism and realistic cars and driving. What this is is
another excellent example of what's wrong with the racing genre.

 THE GOOD:
  Graphics, sounds, detail, cars (interior and exterior)
  Menu System

 THE BAD:
  Virtually unplayable with driving aids turned off
  Pedal sensitivity and feel , even with saturation turned down
  Steering lag
  Bump-n-Grind (The other cars smash each other (and you) around
  the track like a demolition derby!)
  Narrator in your ear all the time (very annoying)
  Car slides around like it was on ice, can burnout from a standstill
  in 4th gear!
  The AI cars don't slide like you do, they grip all the way through
  the turn!

  After Dirt, I thought the same company would nail the driving in this game.
I have other racers (Indianapolis 500, Race Pro, Forza2) that are far more
realistic than this game is. In those games it's your driving that makes
the difference, not how many ""cheats"" you have turned on. I guess if you like
playing with that stuff, you'll like this game just fine. If you're looking for
more realism, though, more sim,I suggest you look elsewhere. I agree with another
poster on F1 in Sept. I hope they don't screw that one up.",0.02276915113871636

15,1.0,"I defeated the game, beat inferno on monster power 5,(theres no point to even doing monster power anyway since the rewarded key for farming is complete garbage 98% of the time).

Where to begin
the game took everything that made Diablo II LoD good, and threw it all out in the trash and kept everything that made the game boring.
then
they added an RMAH/AH to make sure that you don't find any of your own gear (the entire point of the game was supposed to be leveling up skills and finding your own gear to make your skills more powerful, ie +1 to all skills) , but no they even removed that ""feature"" you can't level spells and abilities up, every spell you get is as powerful as its ever going to be (no room for improvement), your skills don't even matter, since everything is based off Main-Stat and Weapon Damage, the only reason to change spells is because you don't like the animation or appearance of a spell, since the spells effects are meaningless (they don't do anything but do damage); so all the spells feel bland/feel the same./pointless you could equip ""throw squirel"" and it would do same damage as ""Fire Beam"".

The wizard is a joke, Teleport is horrible.

In Short, if you were a fan of the past 3 Diablo releases (1 2 lod) you will probably be disappointed with this release, hold off till Diablo 4 or to see if they bring the game back in line with its roots in an expansion.

As it stands the game is unplayable by any measure.... complete garbage.... its a money grab box they might as well of shipped an empty box.",-0.06145364817591204

21,1.0,"One of the most disappointing titles of 08 is Alone in the Dark.

Pros:
- good visuals (but you often won't be able to appreciate them due to a crazy camera)
- good effects (fire and electrical)
- good soundtrack
- good (looking) inventory (it's only good conceptually though, NOT good in practice)
- a nice rebuild-a-world concept. Eden did this incredibly well with Test Drive Unlimited. I suggest you buy that game instead.

Cons:
- EVERYTHING ELSE
- the camera/view/perspective is insane and simply uncontrollable. This game has a 1st person/3rd person/3rd person (forced) perspective. It switches back and forth between these perspectives every 5 seconds against your will (you have no choice), disorienting you, and when the perspective changes the control layout also changes which is even further disorienting. This means that if you are looking around in 1st person (with right thumbstick - like every other game in the world) and the game sudden changes to 3rd person (because they think it's a neat cinematic gimmick), that right thumbstick no longer functions as it did before. In combat, it gets worse. that same thumbstick changes yet again depending on the weapon. Wow, that, is, nuts.
- first person view is too slow
- controls are insane and uncontrollable. As described above, they keep changing and you have to unlearn everything you just learned and relearn what the h*ll everything does based on what perspective you are in and what the situation is. That's the problem. Your brain will still be using the layout you were able to use 2 seconds ago, because that's natural, intuitive and the way most good games work. h*ll, even really bad games have consistent controls.
- there is NO option for the gamer to map the controller as in other games. If they'd put the controls in the gamer's hands, maybe this would have been a 2 or a 3.
- even if you master the constantly changing controls, they are still slow, clunky and unresponsive. Doing things like jumping and just trying to pick something up can be goofy.
- While the inventory system is interesting and has a professional looking interface, it functions like everything else in this game, with poor unintuitive controls. Beyond that, the inventory doesn't pause the action, so you'll get your butt kicked in combat trying to figure out what to do with the inventory...nice
- the use ""fire to kill everything"" gimmick is overused and seems a bit silly. Fire isn't ubiquitous in real life.
- dialog not really inspired
- story not really engaging
- don't really care about the characters
- driving is horrid. I won't even talk about it.
- combat is tedious, long, difficult and silly using the clunky controls. and again, UNINTUITIVE and utterly inconsistent.
- All of the above means POOR GAME TESTING. Somebody, somewhere at some point must have mentioned the camera and controls. My guess is that somebody did, they weren't the boss, and the boss never played the game.

Usually with bad games, you have things like bad AI which runs right at you, low-rez textures, bugs, poor collision detection, stuff like that. These are hallmarks of low budgets, rushed titles, noob programmers, etc...Alone in the Dark is very bad is UNUSUAL ways. Like they had a big budget, decent developers, and had good tools in their hands, but still managed to create a monstrosity. That crazy show ""Cop Rock"" comes to mind.

25,1.0,"The main reason I purchased this game was the mention on the case of an egg-catching mini-game.  An arcade puzzle game from the 80's titled 'Chicken Shift', and my fruitless search to find said game again for the next 20 years, immediately sprung to mind.  So I shelled out $30 for 'Chicken Shoot' and was on my way back to my trailer for some beer-swillin', chicken-shootin', egg-catchin', hootin' and hollerin' good times.  Or so I thought.

I popped the game in my Wii and while the lackluster graphics were an immediate red flag, I reassured myself that I've already spent more money on worse-looking games for the Wii.

My first mission was to hunt down the egg-catching mini-game, which turned out to be nothing like my beloved 'Chicken Shift' (strike #2 and I hadn't even had the disc in for 2 minutes) It seemed to automatically toggle between being overly-sensitive to non-responsive - a trait which rendered the egg-catching portion of the game completely useless to me.  Then logic mode kicked in and I had to ask myself, why the farmer was even going through the trouble of catching the eggs when he's just going to shoot them after they hatch?!?

So I moved on to the shooting portion, which is the alleged meat and bones of this game - figuratively speaking.  Here you have the same chickens repeatedly juxtaposed onto different backgrounds.  The mannerisms of the chickens distinctly remind me of the Whammy animations from the 80's game show 'Press Your Luck'.  Can anyone say cheezy?!?

Suppose you pick off the chicken washing her laundry on the bottom of the screen.  If you move elsewhere on the same level, the same laundry-washing chicken re-appears in the same spot where you had just shot her.  Annoying.  They could at least vary what pops up in a particular space.

The only thing that really varies in the game other than the cheap middle school play backdrops which change from level to level, is the different style weapons which you get to use.  I didn't play long enough to figure out how I managed to get other weapons or why some weapons lingered around for a while and others disappeared after firing six rounds.  It would have been nice if you could work your way up to even more ridiculously overpowered weapons such as cannons and flame-throwers, but since this game isn't very well thought out to begin with, I guess I can't expect much.

I did wind up playing this for about a half hour in order to give it a chance, but it gets old really quick.  The graphics, audio and just about everything else seems not only dated, but below sub-standard, if that's even possible.  This is supposed to be a 'next generation' console - I wish the game developers for the Wii would give us some titles that are worthy of the phrase.",-0.043504997866284714

I could, but I don't want to open an EA account.  No one wants to open an EA account.  This has been a major roadblock to liking this game.

But hey I can still play career mode.  Let's do that.  Now this game is developed by Criterion Games.  They developed the awesome Burnout 3: Takedown and Burnout Revenge.  I've seen more than a few critics compare this game (favorably and unfavorably) to Burnout.  As a Burnout fan I can say this game IS NOT LIKE BURNOUT.  There will be no wrecking of other racers here.  In fact this game will punish you for touching anything.  If you so much as rub another car you'll slow down and they'll speed off like you weren't even there.  Boosting is controlled in very short bursts so this game never achieves the sense of speed I've come to expect from other Criterion racers and every track so far has been painfully dull.

The police are a little better because sometimes you get to ram outlaw cars, but it's never as satisfying as it is in Burnout and the police career mode is still full of boring tracks and penalties for reckless driving.

Also this game only seems to be in a wide screen format and the text is very small.  There actually doesn't seem to be much of anything in the way of options for this game.

I downloaded the version 1.8 patch and lost all of the profile files I had and there were no more challenges, just a blank screen and when I clicked on start, I'm in a field with grass and trees instead of a river. I think the patch is on crack!

First, the game can only be used with certain video cards, which is something I did not learn until after I received the product. Specifically, it can only be used with a GeForce 1/2/3/4/FX or an ATI 7500-9000 series graphics processor. Now keep in nind, I meet those specs anway.

Second, you need the 1st CD (of 3) to play the game. Although not normally a problem, if you have an ultraportable or tablet PC, forget about this product.

Third, the installation is over 540mb minimum install. Thats if you do not install anything but just the pure game files.

After installing, I rebooted my Dell 8300 (2gb Ram P4 3.0, 400gb hard drive, ATI Graphics card with 256mb RAM on board). I started the program, and it locked up my computer. Tried again, no luck. Rebooted and tried opening the program, it finally opened. However, all the graphics were off.

Long story short, this game should be taken off the market and the development team put out on the street.

58,1.0,"i hate to say it but this game is just not that good. i suffered through the whole game for the story as im a huge RE fan but even that for the most part was kinda lame. with the game overall its like they were trying to put a little something for everybody, but didn't do any one thing good.

first the combat- this area of the game was bad. it reminds of a mediocre shooter from the 90s- like passable back then but not acceptable now. the duck and cover system(if u can call it that)is just way too clunky to use all the time and i find you usually just end up shooting out in the open or running up and using melee. you have to hold down a trigger to stay in cover and then when you want to shoot over crates or around walls you have constantly fight the camera views. and for some reason when u pop up or out from cover to shoot, instead of the reticle being in the general vicinity of where you were looking at, its off all the way in the opposite direction. you can run and shoot finally in RE, but i would actually give that up and take the combat system from re5 rather than this. theres full time melee in this and you can use it whenever you want and not just knife slashes like in the old ones. that can be fun at times but it has a power gauge thats runs out and you have wait for it to power back up to use it again. and u may have seen some reviews comparing it to gears of war- ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE! so u have fair warning, don't buy this looking for a shooter of gears caliber.

the cut scenes- this game has ALOT of them and not just regular cut scenes which i don't really mind, if they are advancing the story. no they have the dopey cut scenes w/ the press this button or worse shake the control stick before the meter runs down, if not your dead. i either want to play the game my way and have full control or sit back and just enjoy a cut scene. not have these lame semi-interactive scenes that are reminiscent of rail shooters.

inventory/ upgrade system- the other things are bad but this for me, was the final stake in the coffin for this game. you have a skill set of 3 slots, and u can only equip 3 skills at a time. now u can have multiple skill set blocks of 3 but u still can only equip 1 block at a time. so u are kind of pigeon holed in mostly taking the best 3 all the time even though theres like probley 50 different skills. which include infinite ammo for each weapon type and since theres no upgrading individual weapons to make them stronger. you buy a skill to make all weapons stronger, but it has to be equipped all the time or your weapons just go back to square 1. i had alot of fun upgrading my weapons in previous RE games and opening new weapons. going back through w/ just a magnum on unlimited ammo to see if i could do the whole game bosses and all. it added alot of replayability. this new system gives me no desire to ""upgrade"", if you can call it that. or any reason to continue playing

spoiler alert:

story/campaign- the game is split into 4 character storys that intersect mostly in china. chris for some reason saw a few team members die and now hes a drunk who has to be dragged outta the bar by piers a new character. um chris lost jill for dead, he lost most of his crew in RE1, but now he loses it because 4 guys die??? anyway his campaign leads a team of bsaa men w/ piers as his sidekick. and btw wheres jill??
leon's  campaign is very reminiscent of re4 and in some places almost a rehash of it. and for some reason leon and Helaina are immune to the c-virus gas, a whole plane is infected but they walking around like its a cloud of cigarette smoke. both end bosses in chris and leon campaigns are kinds lame theres no rhyme or reason to how to beat them, or story cannon in the campaign that would give you clues. i just found out by accident. but early into leons campaign, helaina's sister was interesting though
jakes campaign is in my opinion the most fun in the game, although the second mission in his campaign is the worst in the game(bad graphics) and they screw that up good. his end boss is one of the few times i had fun in the whole game.
ada's campaign is puzzle heavy specially in the beginning and hers is where the story starts to fall apart. who the hell is clara? and really the whole world is going to end because of a twisted love story? wtf???

anyway if you are a RE fan wait till it comes down to $20 or rent it, if not id say pass. there is nothing really here for you.",-0.014023660851295914

The controls are lousy. You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail. The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping. Miserable to play throughout.

The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s). I can't get decent frames no matter what. I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics. Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly. Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.

You really do need multiplayer to handle seige engines by one person and the dogs by another and the chariots and archers etc etc cause as a single player it aint gonna work so just end up piling all your troops on top of the other and usually if your numbers are greater you will win everytime. Stupid AI

This reminds me of all the hype of Tresspasser Jurassic Park, and how it would be non scripted and you could go everywhere and really feel immersed in that Island B world

  Well in the end the game was interesting for its concepts but scripted and dull, but if you went over to some fan forums it seemed like the game couldn't do no wrong and who the hell was anybody else to say otherwise.

So the people who give it 5 stars kinda puzzle me. Cant return the game so it has to be 5 stars? Cant admit that its not the end all and be all of the TW series so its gotta be good and the rest of us don't know how to play or our computer sucks, yada yada?

102,1.0,"Purchased the Ultimate version of HoT directly from NCSOFT, ArenaNet on Friday and started the game. I understood it would take some time for the extra GEMS to be available not a big deal.  But what is that I am not able to use the Trader to buy items with the cash I have made while in the game. So I get the extra Character Slot, Minor Items in game, No GEMS for up to 72 hours and I have to wait 4 Days to use the trade system to do anything. This might not seem like a big deal but you are not able to buy additional bank slots, bags, or anything else even with the game cash earned while playing! This makes no sense at all. I purchased the expansion with the core game on Friday, spent $100 for it knowing full well I would not have the GEMS right away but there was no mention that I would not be able to use a core component on the game for 4 days!  I have limited time to play and knew I could get in some time this weekend but now I am at a standstill because I don't have bags, can't expand my bank slots and have to rely on drops and vendors only for items instead of going to the Trader.

114,1.0,"This was greatly disapointing, at the time it was released i was highly anticipating this game. Took some years later to get around to getting a copy, and it definitely wasn't worth the wait.

This is not worth even calling a game in my opinion. The fact you have to take your Digimon partner to the bathroom every 5minutes made me giveup my first game after a while of torturing myself and hoping it got better but kept getting more disapointed. If you don't take your partner to the bathroom it poops on the ground, and if you walk too close after he eats it. And the only way to clean it is for him to eat it(and it gets harder to avoid the more ''accidents'' your partner makes. Instead of a flash or something it makes you wait for your Digimon to use the potty. The character who is human don't ever eat or use the toilet(as far as i have seen), which is odd since your character is supposed to be a boy from the physical world, and your partner Digimon is supposed to be a digital monster(so you would think the reverse would be more likely).

So you are left with 2 options run to the bathroom to keep your partner from having an ''accident''  or let him have accidents and once he eats so many he'll digivolve into Numemon Who is supposed to happen to digimon who are poorly trained and don't have personal cleanliness(but if you train and still make a few accidents but always feed your partner when he's hungry he will still end up Numemon). And if your traveling to follow the story, it's hard to time it so you find your way to the next bathroom before the next ''accident'' occurs.

i will not buy or rent any of the next games, because this was such a failure. i mean do you train your dog to use the toilet, then watch him everytime he goes..?

AGVN should review this, i mean the game is not fun at all what i have played. The sims i'll admit the characters have to use the toilet occasionally, but it's a longer time in-between bathroom breaks and you can switch between characters when one is in the bathroom you don't have to watch and wait when you just want to play the darn game.",0.00010782853867960246
115,1.0,"I love the HOMM series with the following exceptions (playstation version and pc version 5)

There are some excellent reviews written on the game.  I want to add my frustrations to the growing list of lack of description and maps...

1: The graphics are too Nintendo like.  HOMM4 was crisp and detailed enough for this style of game.  The new graphics make me think im playing the gamecube and not my PC.  The cut scene graphics are very stale.  Given the high horsepower requirements for this game and the animations in combat, the cut scenes could have a bit more going on.  (example, you hear the voices of the people talking, but their mouths never move)

2: The game cheats.  Ok all strategy video games cheat as the computer doesnt have to follow all the same rules the player does.  However they need to set some limits on things.  For example the final scenario in campaign 1 you need to over throw the dark tower, but first you must clear out a gateway.  usually not a problem, but this one is manned pretty well.  Obvious solution is to build a bigger army.  I probably spent a game month building what I thought would be a devistating army.  I faced the gate with 12 archangles lots of cavliers and knights and so on.  The computer had 1000 devils, 3000 sucubuss like createus and so on and so on. There is no way the computer could have generated that many units out of its town.  I know in past version of HOMM unit stacks would increase over time, but this seems to have increased exponentually.  Thus the scenario was made unplayable, and needed to be restarted.

3: Removal of the best parts of HOMM 4.  They took out the caravan and free movement of units.  I thought these were great features.  Now i need a hero to baby sit units being moved to the front line while my main heroes are battling it out.

I guess Im missing the need to remake HOMM 3 again.  I've stopped playing the game and probably won't pick it up again.  It is not that repeat playable in its current configuration and offers no value for my money.",0.017639249639249642
116,1.0,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, as I liked the steampunk setting and the exploration mechanic involving revealing the world map with energy hexes. I was also mildly interested in the story, and would have liked to have finished the game just to enjoy that. However the battle mechanics are awful. Whoever designed this part of the game must have been seriously mentally deficient, because no normal person could have possibly designed a worse combat system.

First the damage types are poorly designed. The game has 3 weapons types - pistols, machine guns, and grenades. Machine guns inflict ""scratch"" damage, and pistols and grenades inflict ""direct"" damage. Machine guns inflict incredible amounts of scratch damage, but cannot kill enemies. Pistols and grenades can kill enemies, but do little damage by themselves. This forces you to weaken your enemies with machine guns, then finish them off with a pistol or grenade.

This is really stupid. Considering that most enemies have both a health bar, and an armor bar, I would rather have had grenades to incredible damage to armor, machine guns do incredible damage to health (but poorly against armor) and pistols have 50% bleedthrough through armor. All weapons should be lethal. This would have made the game more tactical, and prevented third wheel syndrome in your party (as it is, what do you do with the third guy in the party - all you need is a machine gun and pistol!)

Second, the game's death penalty is tormentive. It's bad enough that you have to reload your save and lose hours of progress because you lost a battle, but this game presents you with non-options that I can only surmise are for the exclusive purpose of frustrating you. It has ""Retry"" that lets you restart a battle (costing money) without any bezels, which means all you do is die quickly as you can't hero attack without bezels. I mean, if you died against these enemies WITH bezels, why would it think you can beat them WITHOUT bezels!? Then is has the ever-unpopular ""Recover Hero Gauge and Retry"" witch restores all your bezels and costs a ridiculous fortune, scaling to your level, which you can never, ever afford.

Again, this is really stupid. I would have removed both those options, and had one option to retry that restores your bezels, at the cost of a limited item rewarded by bosses. So you can retry a battle a limited number of times per game playthrough, so you have that option if you reach a particularly bad fight, but at the same time doesn't become a crutch that holds you up through the entire game.

Third, the escort the statue mission in Chapter 4 is the single most poorly designed mission I have ever seen in an RPG. You have to protect a statue as it's carried through a number of rooms (like 6 or 7) and in every room, ALL of the enemies rush the statue and ignore the player's characters. These enemies are all armored and it's not realistically possible to kill more than one per turn, and in the second room you start seeing groups of these things carrying BAZOOKAS. You can't defend the statue. You can't intercept attacks, you can't heal or buff the statue, you can't slow down the enemies. All you can do is try to kill them faster than they kill the statue, and you can't.

To add absurdity on top of stupidity, they allow you to retry and restore the statue to it's full health to help you through this mission. The cost? 50,000 rubies. The mission rewards 20,000 rubies. WOW That's a bargain! Does anyone even have 50,000 rubies on hand, at this point in the game anyway?

Fourth, Ammunition! The shops really don't sell any. You can craft two different kinds of bullets with items, but you cannot buy or craft grenades, at least this early in the game. I would have loved to use some grenades on the escort statue quest, but I used all the ones I found and cannot buy or craft anymore. And I can't find anymore, because I revealed as many hexes as I could on the map already! Whoop de dooo! Yeah, they didn't really put much thought into the crafting system.

Some people might be masochists and enjoy punishing themselves playing a game like this, but I don't. They could have made this game so much better, but this is what you get for giving brainless dolts creative control over a video game. I'm not going to feel bad about tossing this game in the garbage, either. It's not the players fault that this game is bad, it's the developers.",-0.05632455649474536

You wouldn't think that if you buy a relatively recent game that the online portion would no longer work. What is the point of upgrading your car and getting good at it if you cannot take your car out for a challenge among your peers? You can only play the campaign so many times before you want to know where you stand amongst your fellow racers. This game clearly states the ability to race with up to 16 people. If you can't do that, then they have no business selling the product to unsuspecting customers like myself. Given that the XL edition only came out about two and half years, and still on the shelves of many stores, Sony and'or PolyPHONY should not be shutting down its servers for this game. To purchase this game brand new and only to find that a major part of it is no longer functional is a total letdown. In an age where publishers such as Activision keep their servers running for games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops that came out four years ago and at the same time still serving the other Call of Duty games from Black Ops to Ghost this should not be. Sony with its deep pocket should be able to continue serving the Gran Turismo 5 community. They chose to go the in the wrong direction and follow businesses such as EA whose business practice has been to nickel and dime customers and give them less for their money. Producing a game such as Gran Turismo 5 XL Edition and then pulling the plug on the customers is simply, to put it short, bad business practice. As such, I will no longer be purchasing any more Gran Turismo iterations ever again. I am sure that they will do the same to the Gran Turismo 6 customers.

This is probably a contributing factor for the graphics not being up to the usual amazing standard of previous J&D games and why it doesn't use the proper right-stick camera control for PS2 players expect. The camera control was a VERY big issue for me. It is broken to the point that the game becomes really frustrating. I was often surrounded by baddies and just had to keep shooting in hopes of hitting the enemies I knew were somewhere out in front of me. The story feels weak and the Dark Daxter sequences feel out of place to me, like they were just tacked on.

First off, the reason I bought this game is because I had previously owned the second of these unleashed force games. The second is great, the only problem was that it is a bit short. Doesn't last long unless you play it through twice. It received a lot of negative reviews, but it honestly was very good. I'd recommend it highly. It's a fun game. However, the first of these games has way too much provocative clothing. One of the characters, Maris Brood, it actually partially naked in the game.

Yah, I knew that there would be a little bit of this revealing clothing when I bought the game, but I didn't know that it would be so bad. It really is worse than you'd think.

142,1.0,"Seems like this game was deliberately programmed to infuriate me. It's one of those games where you get your butt kicked while you're learning, a sensation I've never treasured. How would you like if I sat you down to a board game you didn't know -- you ask, ""How is it played?"" and I respond, ""Uh, you'll more or less get the idea once I start attacking you!"" That's exactly how this game works. I hate losing while I'm learning.

Anyhow, here's some other things:

1. The way this game was marketed promised a lot of good ol' hack-and-slash action. Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc. Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these! I solve enough g.d. conundrums every day at work: I don't need a video game testing my intelligence. I want to be a guy with huge muscles who runs around slaying monsters with his awesome sword! Is that too much to ask!?

2. The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time. Nearly every encounter is based on the ""cage match"" paradigm: your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue. Yawn.

3. You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type. This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way. This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at. Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements. As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see (e.g., the ledges he's jumping from and to), but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art.

4. The ""easy mode"" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges (i.e, the spike room, flying through the tunnels), they still manage to infuriate everybody.

5. The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game. (I frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done).  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.

6. This game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is (e.g., remember jumping behind Athena's bed?). Most of the time this is because the lighting source (and therefore the shadows) are illogical, so it's difficult to gauge distance and height. Consequently, success in the game's many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill. Also, the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle: sometimes, you can leap vast chasms; other times, you can barely hop over a puddle.

7. I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again. Why doesn't this game let you skip them?

8. The storyline is preposterous. The Olympians are immortal! How can they be killed? And how can you kill people who are already in Hades? And does it make sense that Kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of Olympus when he even can't jump over an effin' puddle!? The gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug!

9. The weapons you get have some grandiose names (e.g., ""Bow of Apollo,"" ""Claws of Hades""), but they're quite ineffectual, even against garden-variety zombies. If you're fighting a run-of-the-mill skeleton and it takes like 50 hits to kill him, it's time for a new weapon. (I love how the much-vaunted ""Bow of Apollo"" has about as much oomph as a spitwad.)

10. Curse you, Yu Suzuki, or whoever invented QTEs (Quick Time Events). I hate them. (These are the times when it's basically a cut scene but you have to press the X button or the O button at the right time.) What is this, the fourth grade? Are we learning to identify shapes this week? Another problem with these is that you can't focus on the cool graphics at all, since you're waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes. QTEs need to be outlawed!

11. This game is far too violent for my taste!  It just got to the point where you didn't want to enter QTEs when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross. If this had been a movie, it probably would have received an X for violence.  I mean, you're graphically pulling folk's heads off and stuff  Couldn't they have at least included a ""BLOOD OFF"" option, like they did in Assassin's Creed II?

12.  Game is not kind to you if you haven't played the first two installments.  You'll be baffled as to what's going on until at least halfway through the game.",-0.024896418767859835

151,1.0,"I am a BIG fan of the Socom series...except this one.  The very first mistake that they did was make it an On-line ONLY based game.  The game is great in terms of graphics.  The sound is amazing.  The movement is suprisingly fast, depending on your connection, but mine is pretty fast.

What makes this game frustrating is that lack of intelligence of those that are playing.  Don't play this game around kids and don't have the blue tooth on.  You'll hear all the cursing and downright raunchy comments made by the guys playing the game.  If you are a novice, like I am, forget it.  I've been ""Voted Out"" by the other players maybe because I wasn't fast enough, or had enough kills and even learning how the game is.  I'm just learning the game.  But, to tell the truth, I don't know if I want to learn the game as much now. Because the levels are just not that interesting.  I like the other games which you had missions to do and you had to converse with your team where to go and what to do.  They did it.  Maybe not right all the time, but you didn't see a whole team running about with no coordination.  Everyone seems to just be going where they please.

This game IS a great idea though.  Connecting players everywhere to play a game.  I just think there are parameters that should be built in the game.  Lose the communication.  Useless.  I've heard nonsense.  One guy was singing a song.  Another bragging that he was high and needed to get more booze so he can get really drunk.  I don't want to hear that.  So, what I found myself doing was leaving the BlueTooth on, and just setting it on the counter so I wouldn't hear all the nonsense.  I turned off the ear piece one time and you can here their stupid comments through the speakers with the rest of the game and my kid was in the room!!

One thing that I wish that this game had was a level of skill where you can join a game on your skill level.  For example, when you connect to a game, it would automatically put you in a game where all players that are of lower rank would play.  If you were a high rank, it would keep you out, because obviously, you don't belong.  Then as you increase your skills, you graduate to another level where you are teamed with guys on that level, and so on.  That would be much better I think.  Because it seems like no matter what skill level you are, you'll be in the mix with guys that play the game together and will actually KILL YOU if you are not up to their standards.

Konami was too lazy to remaster games 1 and 4, because they didn't want to put in the extra effort, so calling this an HD collection is really stretching it in first place. Same can be said for the Metal Gear Solid Collection (which is far more superior to this in every way, so we should thank Konami for not screwing that up) All Komani had to do was polish up the visuals like the Devil May Cry collection; (even thought the cutscenes are not full hd but whatever) no biggie right? Wrong! The most notable changes were the missing audio in cretian sections, script changes, and the censorship of the Pyramid Head scene. The reason why this collection is so bad is, because some genius over at Konami though it was a good idea to release the UNCOMPLETED BETTA VERSIONS of the games for the HD Collection!!

The items are the same more or less, just with bigger bloated numbers, the items are still boring / generic +to main stat
The drop rates are better because of a lack of Auction House.

What bugs me most is how pointless actually playing on the console is, anyone with some know-how could probably just pull their hard-drive from their Xbox/ps3 and manipulate their Save-File, which essentially turns the console version into an OPEN B.Net (hacks/mods/modified characters and items etc.. etc...) its only a matter of time.

Again No real PvP System STILL brawling is pointless and its a one-shot fest, i either one shot you, or you one shot me 50/50 so there is no real pvp system which makes all that loot gathering pointless.

The console version is better than the pc version, but the pc version was so terrible that the console version is still in the realm of ""bad game"" territory.

Diablo III needs an expansion to save it complete with an over-haul Item and PvP patch.... a port to consoles minus an Auction House Scam is not going to save this game.

I hope it sells well so that blizzard thinks about dumping more money into this dead game.
All in all this game is a rental at best, I would rent it - beat it and then bring it back.... it has very little replay value.
If you really want to own this game, I would wait till it goes on sale used or in the bargain bin a month or two down the road.... its not worth the 60$.... 10~25$ is a fair price for the content the game has to offer.

Im sure a lot of fan-boys out there will not like reading this, but thats fine to each their own... but the game just doesn't have a lot to offer, your much better off playing games like Torchlight II on console than you are playind D3.... games like that just have WAY more content and customization character options.... Diablo III has almost no character customization AT ALL, so you pretty much finish the game with the same moves as when you started.... leveling in Diablo III is pointless, really hitting level 60 is meaningless.... its soo mind-numbingly easy to do that it just doesn't matter at all, thats why they had to add paragon levels because everyone just hits 60 by the 9 hour mark.

Superman Returns seems as if that may change, but alas, this is just another licensed, mindless beat 'em up, and yet another lame Superman game.  The game starts off promising enough: you fly around Metropolis, and the city is gigantic.  All at once memories of the Spider-Man 2 video game surface because you get the feeling that this could be the type of do anything, anytime gaming that the aforementioned game was based on, but this is not the case.  As all kinds of chaos explode in the city, the more the city gets damaged, the more it's own life bar is drained, and once it's drained all the way, it's game over.  Now, it's a nice change of pace that Superman himself doesn't have a life bar, but why are his powers (heat vision, super breath, etc.) still have to be so limited and only attained after completing boring, repetitive objectives?  The fighting system is boring, and for Metropolis being so big, there's hardly anything really to do.  There's a nice list of villains to take on; including Metallo, Bizarro, Mr. Mxyzptlk, and of course, Lex Luthor.  After that, it all goes even further downhill.

Back to the Patuoxun now, I like the quick double-click button.  The DPI button is somewhat difficult to reach and is only one direction.  So you are required to cycle through all DPI to get the one you want, rather than an up-down cycle.

My biggest complaint - after using this for about a day my hand was cramping.  I noticed I have to spend considerably more effort ""picking"" the items I want with the mouse.  I think the resolution is messed up.  I still need to spend some time with it and see if I can get the proper settings in Windows 7 and the proper DPI to use it.

There's a lot of strong talk about this game and it's downfalls and although they've been posted, they haven't been deleted. MY comment WAS deleted... This is what it said,
""This was the last straw Call of Duty... Truly... I mean, anyone in the know, KNOWS that Titanfall was made by the same developers that were meant to create Ghosts but weren't allowed to make the changes that were attempted... Those developers went on to create Titanfall... And then Ghosts was created as it is today yet did terribly. The only problem I had with Ghosts was the fact that Core gameplay felt just like Hardcore because of the ""lowered health"". You only took 1-3 shots depending on the weapon that shot you to die in Core gameplay as if it was a Hardcore match in any other COD game. Depending on how I'm feeling, I switch between both on any COD game. Now.... Titanfall had amazing success for being new, fresh and altogether unique. So what does COD do? They make Modern Warfare... Why not right? I mean, they TURNED DOWN the idea that was Titanfall which pushed these developers (with their new idea) to go their own way and create the game on their own. Seems like they went in the wrong direction right? WRONG! If Ghosts had the same health (or ""life"") as most other COD games that allowed someone to take 4-6 shots on Core gameplay, it wouldn't have done so badly. I'm actually good at Ghosts, hell, I'm good at BO 1, 2 and even this miserable 3. I'm a shooter-game fan. I LOVE Halo, Destiny, Titanfall, Medal of Honor, Call of Duty... But this game ISN'T Call of F*****G Duty! It is a bandwagon jumper that slapped Black Ops on the title and hoped (and did... unfortunately) to make a buck. Don't get me wrong, not only am I good at the game, it's not all that bad... But It's not Call of Duty and DEFINITELY NOT a Black Ops game. Since I got BO3 and played it for a week, I've played BO2 and even Ghosts more than ever... Why? Because it's Call of Duty! A war-game style run-n-gun involving strategy and teamwork. You've slaughtered your franchise by humping the bandwagon Call of Duty. You look like a kid wearing trendy clothes without a clue regarding what you stand for anymore. The world around you changed and you drove the knife in your stomach by changing with it.""

183,1.0,"Before you even open the box, you see NES SNES Genesis G-Force. What's G-force? I googled it. Nobody seems to know. Some people thing maybe it's the gun? Sounds like another system to me. The box even shows an extra slot for the G-Force carts.

Speaking of another system, a machine that plays NES and SNES and is named ""FC"" is also intentionally misleading - it does not play FamiCom or Super FamiCom (Japanese NES & SNES). They don't fit.

On the back of the console there is an O/J switch. The unit comes with no instruction book and the instructions on the back of the box make no mention of what it is. What does it do? That's for archaeologists to figure out.

It has 2 Genesis controller ports on the front that play the special custom controller and no other ports. Every other system has multiple controller hookups for every system it plays so you can use your original controllers. This only plays its own controllers. Bad luck for you if one dies or you like to play the proper controller.

I haven't even plugged this thing in yet and I'm already irritated with it......

And then I turned it on....

I've had the Gen-x Duo and the Retron 3, this has by FAR the best quality video output. The unit renders the picture as good as the original AND adds sidebars so it is not stretched out on today's widescreen TVs. The colors are much more true to the original compared to the other 2, the picture more crisp/bright/sharp and the colors are true - something I can't say for either of the other machines.

This, like every other system that is combined NES & Sega, uses the backwards NES button map, crossing A and B. Since you can't plug in a genuine controller, you're stuck with it. (Genesis Controller is ABC, NES is B A - This unit switches the NES to AB, reversing the button map)

The machining tolerances on the cartridge doors are loose, so loose that you can actually stick the NES cart in and hit the wrong spot leaving you feeling around for the hole in the dark.

Pulling some of the NES carts out is also hard, the circuit board reader is too tight and sometimes doesn't want to let go.

The gun is useless also. We all know the original NES guns don't work on modern flatscreens because the system can't read the 120hz screen, it is looking for the 60hz flash of the old glass TVs. That being said, THIS ISN'T A 1980s NINTENDO GUN. THIS IS A BRAND NEW MACHINE. There is **NO*** accecptable reason why the gun shouldn't be designed to work on modern TVs.

This system is also having problems reading NES carts that work in my Retro 3. Blank screens, squares of gibberish, etc. All of my games have immaculate contacts, professionally polished in brand new condition. It's not dirt, this thing just won't play them, like the ROM is dead but these games are known to be good.

After less than a week the power supply died, taking the whole system with it. Even if it didn't it wouldn't be worth keeping, it only plays some of the games",0.005289088982965085

I couldn't get pass the first level. The entire game looks like a huge oil slick was dumped on everything. One can barely make out characters or details because of the ugly color scheme and detail given to everything. The story is cheap and stupid - rather than provide an intriguing storyline and main character, the player is given cuss words and a main character that's about as ugly and filthy as his language. The combo system is clunky, frustrating, and pointless. Hell, the main character should be able to curse everyone out and just walk off. That's how the fight system should've been. Choose the best cuss word and watch what happens.

It's a stupid game developed by stupid people that knew they could cash in easily with the use of strong language that (mostly kids, wink wink) would be shocked at. I'm sure they were pissed with the M+17 rating as this game clearly was not targeting an intelligent, 20yr old+ audience.

206,1.0,"Purchasing Gladius, I was under the impression I'd be getting an RPG based on Ancient Rome, dealing with building a Gladiator school and the likes.

First off, despite being called ""Gladius"" and dealing with Gladiators, it was completely ahistorical, with the brilliantly named ""Empire of Imperia"" apparently taking the place of Rome, and some generically ""Naundark"" or whatever named Barbarian kingdom perhaps taking the place of some Germanic tribes.

Aside from a ridiculously stupid storyline which takes liberally from every random generic magical fantasy story having to do with constellations of the bear's womb, the magic of the Gods, enchanted items and broad sweeping remarks by old people about ""prophecies"" and ""destiny"" and all that boring noise, the sentiments of Ursula's (one of the main character) brother mirrors much of the players' sentiments as well: ""More talk... when are we going to get to some action?""

If you like Pokemon games for Gameboy, you'd likely love the battle system here.  It consists of taking very slow-to-pass turns walking on paths which render the field into a grid with big squares and limited movement.  Attacks consist of selecting the enemy, hitting ""Strike"", then playing a mini variant of something like ""Mario Golf"" with trying to hit a little bar right when it lands on red for a critical strike, or settling for the far larger part of the bar marked yellow.  This goes back and forth until someone wins.

This makes up the action combat of the game, while the background economics are a complex sort of deal that is difficult to keep track of in itself.  I had no idea I had only hired a gladiator for one battle, and couldn't even check on her until I started a battle to select my fighters.

I do well at solving the ""difficult"" and ""fiendish"" puzzles in the New York Post Sudoku books (in my opinion are the best Sudoku books out there).  I thought I'd divert from these puzzles and try a shot at Platinum Sudoku after reading some of the reviews.

So far I've spent about 3-4 hours playing and have only solved 10 puzzles.  The puzzles are frustrating and challenging.  The ""Easy"" mode is not that easy, and I've barely scratched the surface on ""Medium"" mode. The numbers in ""draft"" mode (for guessing numbers)is so small that you have to get out your reading glasses to see what you've marked.  Also, the default font is incredibly hard to read and to get used to.  Unless you unlock some new fonts by completing several puzzles, there's really not a good font to select.  That alone makes the puzzles difficult to complete.  One of the things I have to agree with many other reviewers is the stupid girl and guy that supposedly pumps you up and makes you feel like you've accomplished something after completing a puzzle.  Give me a break!  It would have been nice to have the option to turn this feature off, similar to the music option.

The graphics are okay, but that's not what a good Sudoku puzzle is all about.

Ugly textures and graphics make the game look like the belong in the last gen consoles. You have to download a 2gig texture dlc, if you want better graphics. Dowloading the game updates also didn't fix and glitches or bad shooting aspects. Warfighter is a true mess and deserves to fail. It does not deserve your time or money.  There are tons of better shooters out there. This isn't one of them.

Pros:

-you can buy this crap game for less than $20

Cons:

-lousy controls
-lousy gun response
-game freezes
-lousy graphics
-lousy multiplayer
-collision detection problems
-ugly textures
-no ragdoll physics",-0.05850068734684118
243,1.0,"This installment of Final Fantasy is definitely story driven. Sadly, however, the story is weak. Six months after playing the game, I can't even remember what those triangular spirits were about. Thank goodness for the nice dialogue. Without it the game would be untolerable. Character interaction is minimal, and there is no real team spirit.
The main character Vaan and his friend Penelo seem to be nothing more than luggage. There's no point in them being in the game. I can't say that's a good thing.
The evil guys and side characters are lame and their doings seem pointless. As with the main characters, none are truly explored.
Talking with the townspeople is utterly pointless.

The graphics are nice, though nothing mind-blowing. I didn't want to stop to view the scenery at any point. I have to applaud them for making the cities even a bit lively looking, by adding a lot of silent characters. One point of complaint is the very lame spell effects.
The CGI scenes are nothing spectacular, definitely a step back from FFX. This was the first installment in the series where I wasn't looking forward to seeing the CGI scenes.

The voice-acting is good, all the main characters give solid performances. *But* the Marquis and Al-Cid almost succeed in spoiling my respect towards the other performances. Thank goodness they have so few lines. All in all the voice acting is one of the best aspects of the game.

The real-time battle system is a radical change from past games. It's nice but doesn't make the battles less tedious or repetitive in the long run. The enemies are also mostly boring.
The party AI doesn't really shine, but thank goodness you can limit its stupidity with the Gambit System. Too bad that lots of the useful gambits appear only at the later stages of the game.

The license board works for someone who likes perfect customization, but unfortunately I don't. I want characters who truly differ in their abilities. And talking about abilities, I found all the skills and most of the power ups really lame and useless.
The summons, called Espers, are stupid-looking and useless in combat.

The maps are at times annoyingly large. The fact that there are no secrets or secret places, and the randomized treasure, add to the insult. Many times the game devolved into a multiple hour running through empty fields, between short cutscenes.

The music is bad. Nobue Uematsu left them and they replaced him with some clueless punk. There is zero memorability and some themes are just annoying. It's the worst I've heard in any RPG I've played.

CLOSING COMMENTS:
When I started playing, I was positively surprised by the good voice-acting, the nice - and at times witty - dialogue and olden style of speaking used by some characters.
However it didn't take long to become annoyed by the pointless main character Vaan, the trite and stupid plot, lack of character interaction, huge and empty fields/dungeons with random and often useless treasure.
All in all this game is about running hours and hours through fields, fighting repetitive enemies, so you could see a 5 minute stupid cut scene that advances the inane plot.",-0.018925832611690594

Mike Haggar and the rest of the heroes you could play look totally different with swords and appear to have some weird ageing  process where they look like kids. Well I hoped it would be a great fighting game but how wrong was I? There is no skill in this game at all its like a board game with random number generators.

I couldn't wait to finally continue through until the end of that game, as I remember feeding the arcade machines back in the day.  Then, I actually played these wonderful games, and I was extremely disappointed.

There is no uber-fast mode on the pac-man games.  But I wasn't really expecting one.  No.

The biggest gripe, and what really ruins this effort is YOU CAN'T CONTINUE ANY OF THE GAMES.  There is no option to 'insert another coin' and keep playing.  That means unless you are a gaming God, you'll only ever see about 1% of the total content 'programmed' into this collection, because 'Game Over' is final.

I had read somewhere years ago that Mass Effect was going to be a trilogy. Created by the great minds at Bioware who are long gone now. What we have left is EA seeing an opportunity to capitalize on a title and a group of not so skilled writers trying to fill some big shoes. If this was a title that did not have the Mass Effect label it would be fairly decent....not great.

I agree with the previous reviews stating it's faults. The seriousness of the Mass Effect universe is gone replaced by what feels like high school students with cheesy one liners experimenting with their sexuality.

This game is created for people who find Call of Duty and Halo so easy they get bored and refuse to play them. The mini-games must be beaten absolutely flawlessly or you don't get any points whatsoever. Sometimes you even lose points for not absolutely mastering the mini-game. If you're 99% perfect, sorry no points. The biggest flaw in this game is that it has to be four players. If you don't have four players then the computer will take over the rest. Be warned, the computer always wins every single mini game. There's a choice for computer skill...easy, normal, or hard...huh? What is hard skill? Does that mean the game is hard for the computer player or the computer player is hard for you to beat? No explanation whatsoever. But, it does not matter, Ive tried all three settings multiple times and it makes no difference in the computer's amazing flawless skill at mastering the game. The point of the game is to get 20 coins, by absolutely mastering the mini-games as flawlessly as inhumanly possible, then randomly landing on the space where Toad is selling stars for 20 coins. Watch out, there's also a space where, if they have 50 coins, other players can steal your star. They should call this game Star Stealers. The only real trick to the game is to be the one who lands on the star stealing spot the most times...and thus steal everyone else's stars. There's no friendly competition here...it's all about bing underhanded. If you don't have 50 coins to steal a star you can, for zero coins, steal coins from other players. this game always leads to everyone ganging up on the player who is doing the best. There's no skill involved to winning the game over all because it's all about who's lucky enough to land on the star stealing spot the most times. One turn your in first place and the next your in fourth, but when you're in fourth you're stuck. Whoever happens to have the most stars when the game ends wins the game no matter how poorly you played the game. Oh, and don't forget they the shortest version of the game takes 45 minutes minimum. The longest version takes 3+ hours. Ridiculous and frustrating to no end. Its a game that takes a minimal of an hour to lose. No thank you!

So, I got this.

I have used it a few times and the design of the controller is not optimal for using the extra buttons.  The placement is awkward because of how the controller fits in my hands.  I can barely even touch the RB and LB not to mention the buttons above them.  It requires your index finger to stretch in a fashion that doesn't have the greatest flexibility in normal human beings.  If you want to use this controller correctly your going to need to adjust your grip on it.

Update:  The controller's left thumb-stick now constantly sends a down signal and it's completely unusable.  It is not even from overuse because I hadn't used the damn thing but a hand full of times and then just put it away for about 3 weeks. POS, I will never buy third-party controllers again.

Firstly, at seemingly random times controllers will get ""mixed up"". You'll be playing a game and suddenly controller 1 becomes controller 2 (or 3, or any other one plugged in). So you have to switch controllers. You can imagine the chaos this can cause in the middle of a multiplayer game. Secondly not every button combination can register at the same time. This won't affect most games, but some that require several buttons pushed together to perform a move (such as Mortal Kombat games) are impossible to do. Not difficult, IMPOSSIBLE because the controller is incapable of that many simultaneous button presses.

For the record: because I wanted to like this game so much I gave it two complete play-throughs with different character types, different play-styles, and on different difficulties. Yes, it was difficult to play so much of a game that I eventually ended-up despising, but I had such high hopes for this series (mostly because of Dragon Age: Origins and my history with BioWare) that I had to be sure I was giving the game a fair shake.

If you liked Dragon Age: Origins -- stay away from this game; it has none of the attention to detail, none of the sense of grandeur, and certainly much less of a heart than it's predecessor. (Well, the graphics are ""better"" in DA2, but Origins managed to keep my interest regardless of its slightly-less-than-amazing graphics; the ""more polished"" look of DA2 was not enough to keep my interest.)

If you liked Mass Effect 2: stick to that series of games; DA2 is not a ""fantasy"" version of Mass Effect 2, and is merely borrowing some mechanics and awkwardly thrusting them into what was already a successful (and vastly different) series.

If you're a BioWare fan because of Baldur's Gate and related games (like me), then there is little for you to love in Dragon Age 2.

If you want to know why this game is so terrible (in a mechanical way, and not speaking about the fact that it's a half-hearted, rushed, big-corporate-production aimed at cashing-in on the success of it's predecessor) then read some of the other reviews here on Amazon, click over to MetaCritic and read the USER reviews, and visit the official BioWare forums.

BioWare fans: you have been wronged, and the world of video games has another artless plastic box taking-up shelf space all over the world.

The game world has several examples of what happens when developers do a rushed, half-hearted job because of responses to ""marketing analysis"" and pressure from the publisher; ""Ultima 9"" and ""Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within"" were always my two favorite examples, but Dragon Age 2 is getting added to that list.",0.03361538011806669

I had been wanting this game for awhile now and finally bought it only to be kept from gameplay by Steam Works/Valve. I know this is a good game because I bought and played the first one endlessly it was so great. But Monolith totally destroyed their product by partnering with Steam/Valve. First, Steam wants you to go on-line just to play so you go on-line. Then it says its going to update the game whether you want to update it right then or not. When it supposedly starts the update it gives you no indication of just how big the update is. It could be 5 Megs or 5 Gigs for all we know. Meanwhile, they bombard you with ads for other games eating up bandwidth as you're trying to download the update. The Steam software supposedly gives you the option to play offline but when you tell it reload in offline mode it just seems to hang up will running your cpu at 100% even after you've exited the software in frustration. You have to go to the task manager and end the process in order to shut the thing down. I'm ticked off at Amazon as well as Monolith over this. There is no way Amazon should allow it's customers to be subject to such a horrible experience as the one you will experience with software bundled with Steam. It reflects badly on Amazon. The very least they could do is post a warning to the customer. And what was Monolith thinking? Certainly not about the gamer.

284,1.0,"Typical CoD multiplayer gamebreakers: People get hit with half a magazine then turn and instakill you, people run through a hail of bullets to knife you, and the shotguns double as sniper rifles and spray rounds almost as fast as a belt-fed machine gun. The difference this time is that many of the maps are open and HUGE (by CoD standards), which is nice for sniping, but if you elect not to snipe, then you're going to find yourself constantly getting shot in the back or side, simply because there's too much ground to scan while you move. On a few occasions, multiple enemies spawned about fifteen feet behind me. I've managed to shoot people who were around corners (I'm talking two-foot-thick-concrete walls with a submachine gun), and it's happened to me quite a bit as well. One change I like is the ability to lean around corners. Don't get confused, though; this game still isn't what I would consider tactical or realistic. Also, dogs instakill you and leap from about fifteen feet. However, the dogs don't even make a biting motion or anything, leaving the whole experience laughably cheesy. I'm supposed to be some kind of badass special-forces guy, but a dog jumping on my chest like I just came home from work kills me? Get real.

Single player is the usual over-the-top, generic, Michael Bay movie snorefest with zero plot, though there is a space-station battle and an underwater, scuba-diving mission that I found supremely entertaining, at least by FPS campaign standards.

The only welcome change in this game is the extinction mode, which is much more fun than the zombies modes of previous games, simply because it's boring to sit there and watch the zombies stagger their way toward you as you unload a thousand rounds into them. Extinction mode is better, in my opinion, because the enemies are faster and don't take an obscene amount of bullets to kill. The goal is destroy alien hives (which look very similar to Zerg hives from Starcraft) by planting a drill in front of the hive and defending it. Additionally, one can interact with the map, such as electrifying fences and starting fires, in order to keep the aliens in check. A major downside is that there is only one map on the disk, though there may one in DLC, but honestly, who wants to pay for that?

Despite the much-better Extinction mode, I cannot recommend this game, simply because it's too much of the same. Extinction mode simply isn't worth the asking price for the game, in my opinion. At best, this game is a two- or three-day rental, as that's probably about all the longer Extinction mode will entertain you.

300,1.0,"This is a VERY bad game.  No matter how bad a game's story, characters, or settings are, the entire game can always be salvaged by how fun it is to play.  In other words, it's combat system.  Final Fantasy 12 has the WORST combat system ever.  Allow me to explain.

Please note that the combat system is not broken or unplayable in anyway.  The problem here is that it is NOT fun.  The way it works is that you input commands and the character executes them once his time meter is charged up.  You can input multiple commands at once and sit back and watch them be executed at the appropriate time.  The game essentially plays itself.

They basically tried to take the concept of turn based combat and do it in real time.  The problem with that is that you are left running around doing nothing until your move is executed.  This is tiresome, not fun, and quite honestly it didn't make me feel immersed in the game at all.  The reason turned based combat is rarely done in real time is that it makes the player realize how much they are not participating in the actual battle.

Real time combat should never have to make you wait around for every action.  The ""Tales"" games along with the ""Star Ocean"" games are a shinning example of how real time combat should be handled.  It allows for fast paced, constant action, while at the same time allowing for deep tactical moves and an insane amount of strategy.

There is a way to do the type of combat this game tried to do.  Valkyria Chronicles is the main game that comes to mind.  It's pretty much a turned based strategy RPG with limitations and time periods for moves.  That game managed to make it fun and deep, where as this game does not.

Story wise the game is boring.  Characters are not memorable at all.

I will say that the open world is enormous and the amount of side quests are quite numerous.  This is a good thing, assuming the game is fun.  Which it is not.

Honestly I REALLY tried to like this game but it's simply too bland, boring, and it lacks the spark that makes other Final Fantasy games recognizable.

Buy Final Fantasy X instead.  The combat is classic turn based and well done.  The characters are memorable and interesting.  And finally the story is far superior to this games forgettable one.

308,1.0,"I purchased this game because it looked promising,both as a story and as a game. I acquire and play lots of video games (Mac, PC and PS3).  I also watch lots of movies.  I am also a Science Fiction enthusiast.

Beyond Two Souls (BTS) is a mashup of video gaming and movies.  In brief, it is my opinion that this game is not worth anyone's time, nor anyone's money.  While I do not believe there are any spoilers, here, your opinion may differ, and you should take that into consideration before continuing with this review.

Executive summary:
Boring, it is a rehash of many Science Fiction films and Literature.
Boring, it has little, if no, game play.
100% Predictable.

Let's just say for one to have a good Movie, one must have a good Story. There is nothing new about this particular story.  I would like to say that there are spoilers, but there are none.  In every direction this movie took, visions of Carrie, Poltergeist and every Telekinetic SciFi film or story came to mind.  Every action, every move, were 100% predictable.  In some sequences, the action was so familiar, I could not help but feel the Developers literally copied the movements and actions from many popular action movies. Yes, Deja Vu applies here.

Now let's talk about game play.  I think I was too kind to call it lame.  In multiplayer mode, one player is in normal mode, the other is psychic mode.  The psychic mode needs to be transferred every time, say to an iPad.  The controls were so clumsy, I finally gave up and just played solo.  For instance, you have to move the controls such that two icons are brought together to invoke a specific telekinetic action.  If I were telekinetic, from Carrie to any other SciFic film or book, the telekinetic action is an Act of Will, not requiring any specific set of hand motions.  The nose bleeding was clearly something from Firestarter (a film about a young girl who could telekinetically start fires).

At those times you are allowed to control the character, the control generally deals with very mundane actions.  For instance, to cross a river, the character moves by you pushing the L1 and R1 buttons to make her cross the river.

In the final phases of the game, our Protagonist must choose her future life.  There have been several video games that deployed this concept, most notably the early Silent Hills games.  However, in BTS, the end results are barely influenced by your actions through the game, but by your choices with whom you will take up with.  I did not get through all the choices, but I understand there are about 21 endings.

The Developers had some very good assets, motion captured from some very attractive and very talented actors.  However, it is not the first time good talent was misapplied to a cliched story, and as an excuse for poor game design.  A saving grace is that you can get through the game fairly quickly, say about 10 to 12 hours.  However, when I look the games I have played, such as Skyrim, Borderlands, Borderlands 2, even Defiance (as derivative as it is), are more fun, more exciting, more interesting, but I am also comparing games that are not of the same genre: BTS is a linear movie, while the others are open ended sandboxes.

The sad part about this is, should this have been made into a 100% movie, it is so badly cliched, so predictable and boring, it would barely make the $5.00 Direct to Video bin at Fry's.",0.003850048190872814
309,1.0,"It's really quite sad because in general I loved this series, but I hate, hate, HATE this game.  More frustrating than fun, it's a game that pretends to hold your hand through the first 5 hours of the game, shuttling you down a corridor without a lot of freedom to explore.  Yet in spite of this, there are things the game stubbornly refuses to tell you how to do, such as how to complete certain quests (one of the NPCs in the game suggests that I just keep doing what I've been doing in over to complete it.)  In another example, I had to go on-line to find out how to access the Armory in the main character's homestead, as nothing in the gameplay or in game manual told me where it was.  Many of the quests involve running around trying not to get shot, or running around on a horse giving orders and trying not to get shot.  Want to go for a walk in the wilderness?  Get ready to deal with annoying Quicktime events!  You see, you can't go anywhere without getting attacked by some random bit of wildlife and when you get attacked you have to mash certain buttons as they appear on screen.  It's not fun.  I hate QTE's, they're a gaming fad that should have gone away by now and at the very least you should have been able to turn it off in the options.

They've also taken away some of the gameplay freedom you had in the previous games.  The first Assassin's Creed, for all its flaws, at least gave you the freedom to interact with the NPCs how you wanted.  It was fun, in a GTA sort of way, to push an NPC into a market stall or start a fight with one and watch the chaos that created.  Unbelievably, you can't do that in AC3.  So in short, there's a lot of stuff to do in the game, but not all of it is fun.  And as other readers have pointed out, the game is a buggy mess.

315,1.0,"I was a HUGE Diablo fan back in the day and have been waiting with barely-contained excitement for this game to be released. Only a decade between installments... let's all collectively hope that Diablo IV comes along sooner than 2032.

The game itself is cool; the physics is great, the environments and immersion, the sense of force and motion. Obviously it is the proper 2012 rendition of the classic. Although they didn't really change up the formula much (shortcut keys on the keyboard, mouse control, hack and slash RPG dungeon crawler), it definitely has lots of little ""oh neat"" features and designs. I hope the developers never read this, because of the level of effort that clearly went into making this game, but I could only really give it a 3/5 for fun because... it's not different enough. It's like the 2004-2010 Jaguar XJ. When it came out, all the critics said, ""technologically brilliant, high quality, beautiful, but... at a glance, is it really different than the last two generations?"" So it goes here. And for whatever reason, the story line so far is kind of schizophrenic, generic, ""old stuff, magic, old stuff, magic"" recipe. In a way, the simpler, dumbed-down stories in Diablo and Diablo II made them somehow more eerie. Here it's just hard to appreciate how so many people lost staffs, hid keys, broke swords into pieces, and how many distinct but equivalently pathological evil magic people/creatures could be working so hard to execute some kind of evil plan. In the original(s), there was a bigger bad guy, a boss, and you had to off him before you kept going. No strings attached, no frills.

Now where the other two stars disappeared: DRM. Battle.net ruined this game. I didn't even play it on its first night. I never experienced the ""can't connect"" problem. But what you find when you play is that you HAVE to go online and sign up for battle.net, regardless of whether or not you have any intention of playing cooperative games. Strike one. Then, you have to sign in with your credentials before the game starts (and can't even save your password... seriously? Is a gamer profile really so important that you can't store your password on your own computer if you want to?)... strike two. Strike three is: if you sit idle in the game for 5 min. or so, battle.net kicks you off and your game ends. Next time you log in, your game reverts TO THE LAST CHECKPOINT. There is no way to save your state. You can quit the game before you get up, but that ALSO reverts you to the last checkpoint. Occasionally you can lose 10, 15 minutes of progress in a larger map, especially if you're trying to explore every corner. So what you do is, get up and go do what you're doing as quickly as possible. I also occasionally keep going by the computer to unpause then re-pause the game just to keep it from kicking me off battle.net.

Additionally: wait until you experience the pleasure of a laggy connection or over-loaded battle-net server. Your client shows that you're swinging at a baddie again and again and again, but not hitting it... while they're striking hits on you. Wait until you get a laggy connection in the middle of a huge fray with tons of monsters and your screen freezes and drops to 0.5FPS. Wish you had control? Wish it was actually just running on YOUR computer, since you're playing single-player? Oh yeah, you bet. So you just get hit, and killed, and re-start, and hope the lag goes away after a few more re-spawns, or if you stop and re-start the game.

This shortcoming is just horrendous, unforgivable. Nobody in product development or QA could have gone through that and said, ""OK, no biggie, the typical player won't care."" This is not only a poorly-executed feature - it's a huge DEFECT, and a MAJOR mistake on behalf of the product people. Single player isn't single player. If you're connection is out, you don't play. If you're on the go, you don't play. If your connection is laggy for any reason, you don't play.

Seriously. Let me play offline. Let me play on my laptop in the car if I want to, or at a cafe without an internet connection. I shouldn't even have to be online at home to play. I shouldn't have the game kicking me out every 5 minutes when I'm just getting up to get the kids something to eat or change a diaper or whatever.

So my 1-star rating is actually a 3-star rating for good gameplay (maybe even 4 stars if your expectation really just was for an updated version of exactly the same recipe, no surprises), minus two stars as a punitive measure for hobbling the overall experience so badly with the damnable DRM.

Oh look... battle.net kicked me off again while I was writing this. I wonder how much progress I lost this time...",-0.0277005763482111
316,1.0,"Well, I won't give out any spoilers, but I will say that this game was definitely pushed through for gullible LOST fans (and I'm one of them) to snatch it up for top dollar.

The voiceover acting is good in some points, terrible in others. Lots of characters are here, but there are some glaring omissions like Boone, Shannon, Rousseau, and Mr. Eko. For some inexplicable reason, the LOST theme music is intact for the first chapter but is subtly changed for all subsequent chapters. Why change it? It makes no sense.

The movement in this game will be either a slow walk or jogging - the character moves like a mannequin with overstarched underwear.

Sure, the facial animations are nice, but the synching of the lips is completely off - there's no excuse to skimp here, because we saw facial animations and lip synching done to perfection in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heavenly-Sword/dp/B000K9OP2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heavenly Sword</a>.

Play time in this game consists mainly of jogging, wandering around, shooting, taking pictures, jumping, sliding under trees like Pete Townsend, and figuring out fuse puzzles. (Yep, you read that right, FUSE PUZZLES.)

This game is very quick - with only seven levels, most gamers will probably finish it in 3 days, which is hardly worth its high price tag.

It would have been wiser for the game developers to wait and release this game 6 to 8 months down the road and give it more quality. Some of the unlockable extras are nice, but there could have been so much more to enjoy with more effort.

Die hard LOST fans and people looking to become LOST fans will be totally confused at why a show that receives such high ratings led to the production of such an inferior game.

320,1.0,"Well after playing FF11 on the PC for its first few years and coming back to it in the past week the physical game itself is certainly improved for anybody starting out fresh in the world of FF11.

However because of a large dashboard update to the Xbox 360 Platform many months ago its apparently put FF11 into a MAJOR state of shock... there are serious issues that have made me close my account within five days and that are completely unrelated to the solid, physical gameplay...

Installation takes a little over an hour and the update, a few hours more (Give or take 4 hours on cable internet).

You MUST Log Out of FF11, log out of the play online viewer and CLOSE play online viewer from within itself.  If you EVER shutdown your console from within the game itself OR the playonline menu OR use quickmenu to switch to anther game without selecting close from the login screen, your entire game is corrupted!

EVERY time this happens you are forced to reformat the ENTIRE HARD DRIVE!!! Thats right, 3 calls to technical support and that is the ""solution""... more like contingency plan... If you happen to have two complete xbox 360 consoles there are ways to TRICK it into showing you the error message thats blocking you but most of us have a single system.

Further more, the game is not on your games list, its stored in cache which means that if you go to clear the system cache it will corrupt your copy of FF11 also prompting another reformat.

There was no forewarning of this at any time during installation.  After experiencing 4 hours, I logged out of the game.  At the POL menu, logged out of that, then used my controller to power down the system.  After coming home from campus today it throws legions of Disc Read Errors at you which are NOT disc read errors.  This is a problem documented all over the place on the internet.

This is also not a problem you can fully control.  During a garrison the system locked up on me after the first reformat (as well as a few other random times) and since you didn't exit through the play online viewer... here goes another 5 hours...

This is reformat 5, every time I talk to their customer support I get total bull... Its a complete shame that such a solid game is destroyed by lack of support from a company that I used to have extremely high regards for in which now has given me some of the worst customer service of my life.

DO NOT buy this game for the XBOX 360 System EVER!  Buy it for the PC or the Playstation.  If you happen to have a second Xbox 360 console lying around, then by all means give it a shot.  Outside of that extreme technical block, the controls worked solid and there were ZERO issues outside of this.  But an issue this big and time consuming destroys any likely hood of advancing in such an immense game.

There are solutions for this but since the game randomly froze up during gameplay, you are forced into this situation.  You shouldn't have to play music on your xbox (which most of us don't have on the machine) and even then this solution doesn't always work.  The game is just broken and unfortunately this is what they had to do to make this work on the XBox.  Poor design and a disappointment for a long term PC player.",-0.01754904412148484

325,1.0,"So I was very excited to grab this game because I LOVE the Assassin's Creed games (only game series I follow religiously). Plus I was a huge fan of the new Grand Theft Auto 5 game. So when the concept of the people who made Assassin's Creed were making a Grand Theft Auto style game, I was all over it. But I'm afraid to say that I just didn't like the game at all. I guess the best way to describe this game, is exactly the way that the guy at Gamestop described it to me ""It doesn't really do anything well, it's all just ok."" Nothing is more close to the truth then this. And it's VERY frustrating, because it feels like a step backwards for the company because of this. The game feels very sluggish to me, there is nothing fluid about it. From the driving to the stealth and moving around. I'm not sure if this is due to lack of attention, or simply inexperienced people working on this title. Plus another further thing that is REALLY annoying. You can't customize the controls, and the way they have some of these controls set up, you scratch your head wondering if they even realized how inconvenient some of the button placements were. An example of this is the power break being the O button and X being to look behind your vehicle (logically you'd make X your power break since it's easier to reach). Then when you go into the options menu, under control schemes, it gives you 4 total options. The default for right handed people, and THREE, count em, THREE Left handed options for Left Handed players. Let me tell you something I AM Left handed, and I would NEVER play the game with the controls they have set for lefties. I think video game developers don't seem to realize that left handed people are raised in a world designed for right handed people, meaning anything you can do with your right hand, we can pretty much do, with the exception of writing. So yea they should have focused more on giving different variations to regular right handed controls. I'd say if renting is still possible (I think they closed almost everywhere you can rent from down lol) rent it or borrow it from a friend, but do NOT pay $60 for THIS game.

Well, below is the review I wrote after a couple of hours of gameplay. As someone else said, it starts out slow and then the story develops. Later in the game you get couple of new guns and new ""FREAKS"" show up!
-It seems someone did not pay a lot of attention to detail for the weapons. If there are 3 rounds left and i push in 5 more rounds to make total of 8 rounds..you don't need to pump the shotgun..a round is already in the muzzle. You pump the shotgun if you completely run out of rounds and feed fresh 8 rounds, now you need to pump one into the chamber before you can fire.
Apparently...this is something simple and should be expected of all FPS by now. ITs little things and attention to detail that make all the difference between a 3 Star and 5 Start FPS

Most importantly,
This game is the most ""SCARY"" game ever. (period)

-----------------------
-----------------------
Overall, this game is weak!
The only good things about this game are the Graphics.
The Game play is bad, same old going through levels and shooting bad guys. Same old guns that make sad sounds. You are playing the whole game is darkness...but if you need a Flash light you need to switch to Flashlight and then switch back to the weapon you were using. ""what the heck, can I not have my flash light taped to my gun"".
and them, you are at a Top notch research facility (Weapons research and what not ) but there are is no Night Vision goggle's. You fire the same old guns...that ofcourse look different but are no better.
Let me put it this way:
Half-Life was better than this game (except the Graphics)
and lets not even start comparing it with HALO, cause this game is not even close to HALO.
oh and did I mention, this game has to RE-PLAY value to it.

If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.

But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didn't include certain things that the PC version and better version had.

First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.

Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.

And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.

I can't express how awful this thing is and it's all because Razer decided to put the profiles in the Cloud, and you can't load them or change them locally without an internet connection.  WORSE, the profile loaded into the thing isn't persistent.  It reloads the default profile each time, and if there's ANY different, it wasn't what you last used.

THAT IS INEXCUSABLE!

Other major issues is that The directional control on the thumb drive is even worse than the driver selection. With no touch cues as to where your thumb might be in relation to the direction, you go spinning off in wild directions all the time, especially if you use it to steer and move your fingers to work the keys.  The button above the directional control and the lever below it are WAY TOO CLOSE and are always being hit by someone with large thumbs (like I have) rendering any kind of profile changes moot using them.  The contacts are twitchy as hell, too, meaning your character looks like it's having a seizure until you figure out which way you're supposed to be going.

Other points: There are NO TOUCH CUES ON ANYTHING.  Buttons are all uniform, flat and have no way to know if you're pressing which one except by looking (or by whatever action happens in-game).  One might get used to that, but if you used an older Nostromo (as I did, and bought this sad excuse of crap as a replacement) you no longer have any way of making sure you hit the right buttons by proper finger placement on a fast touch.  Even the directional controller has NOTHING you can feel to tell which way is forward, and any tiny movement puts you in a different direction altogether.

If you're looking for a replacement for the older, and far superior, Nostromo, a gaming pad that has persistent memory of the last profile and stores it inside, and can be taken any place with, or without, and internet connection to play your games, keep looking.  This is junk IMHO.  Razer basically screwed over every gamer by making it crap to begin with by forcing a cloud-stored profile (as an OPTION, that's fine, but not making it mandatory even to set up a &*^$#^ PROFILE!) and then failing to take into account the complete lack of touch cues that every damned keyboard on the face of the planet has (look at the F and J keys on YOUR keyboard for the nibs that tell you where your fingers are).

I don't know why Razer decided to torture its customers in this manner, but I definitely want my money back.  Nothing thus far has come close to the Nostromo, and the gaming world feels that lack.",-0.09725141314742168

The right game to blame for the worse controls known to man in Survival Horror gaming goes to one game and if not just this one, then the rest of the franchise that spawned from it: FATAL FRAME.

Tecmo had a lot of unique ideas going through their heads for this game, but apparently the one thing they weren't thinking of was the one aspect that would've made this game worth the constant praise it gets.

Does this make any sense? You're playing the entire game as a nineteen year old girl who walks and runs slower than a drunk elephant. Plus, the controls are permanently in 2D meaning that up will force your character to do a 180 and walk in the direction you point her in. Fine in theory, but you have to realize that using 2D controls in a 3D game based entirely off of exploration and using set camera angles that change every time you move to a different room or fight ghosts is not a good idea.

What's worse is that enemies you face in this game move so fast and use up 99.8% of the terrain to their advantage that it's next to impossible to try and hurt them without taking any damage in return. The ghosts are also so vocal, whiny and badly spoken that their dialogue literally murders any atmosphere they had. Plus, I need to argue: who would be terrified of blue ghost children tromping after you with their arms in the air? It's like the game developers were trying to piss you off rather than scare you.

The game is very innovative and unique what with using a camera as a weapon and fighting ghosts as your main enemy, but facing such unfair, aesthetically awkward, questionably malevolent enemies with such unfair controls is about as fun and scary as being chased by a shag carpet in tennis shoes.",-0.027507270850924106

I passed the following levels: Nightmare, Missing persons and I reached the hotel(first boss, Sepulcher).
After getting over the crappy fighting system, slowdowns and graphic bugs, I was excited to fight the damn boss.
While I was trying to hit the meat sacks of the boss, the game targeted the boss itself and NOT the meat sacks. Ok, I dealt with that and I destroyed all 3(or 4) meat sacks and the boss fell on the floor. The next step, you have to hit his hands so he will collapse and you will hit his head and kill him. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT. I couldn't target his hands, I was walking THROUGH his hands, he could hit me but I couldn't harm him. I was swinging the axe into the air and COULD NOT HIT THE BOSS OR HIS HANDS. After about 10 attempts, youtube and walkthrough checks, I rage quit and I threw the game away.

The story is the best part about this game after the graphics, but there's nothing here you haven't seen better before. Most of it is forgettable, but acceptable to get you from point A to point B provided the gameplay or graphics don't put you off.
Story: 6/10

The game went with a relatively painted sort of cell-shaded style, watching the scenes ""written into being"" as the game's equivalent of cinematics is mildly interesting but loses interest. Some people will automatically dislike the apparently cutesy graphics, others will be off-put by the limb-hewing and spurting blood. I didn't think they worked well together, but look up gameplay videos on Youtube to decide for yourself, this is one case where what you see is what you'll get and you may either like or dislike it.
Graphics: 6/10

There are some cries of anger, pain, and ambient noises that all seemed fitting. There weren't spectacular effects or voicing (more than a few of the lines are corny), but I thought that it fit the general tone and theme.
Sound: 7/10

The background music is rather bland, not especially annoying but a pale shadow of what video game music can be.
Music: 5/10

Gameplay is where this game really falls apart. Moving and trying to get the camera to cooperate was clunky and uncooperative. The combat felt rather awkward and unpolished, I had the distinct impression that it was rushed because there was a variety of ""combo attacks"", but none of them were really more effective than mashing the attack buttons and if you're fighting multiple opponents most moves won't be available anyway. Lack of effective smart targeting or good lock-on didn't help, and if you'd been mashing away at one enemy and they fell Rau was liable to continue hacking in that direction while three more soldiers bear down on him from other directions. I believe one word describes every stage of this game, including combat and ""platforming"": clunky.
Gameplay: 3/10

There are little rewards and minor easter eggs you can unlock by accomplishing sub-missions within areas, such as utilizing certain combos, but none of them really helped gameplay and nothing felt worth the time and hassle of going back.
Replayability: 1/10

For all of the ""our game is unique"" hoopla, I wish they would've spent some more time refining the play and areas. It looks like a cartoon, spurts blood like a survival horror, and will probably annoy you like a screaming baby. It definitely doesn't flow or captivate. Definitely rent before you buy, and if you can't try it first I would recommend seeking other games first, there's nothing here that isn't done better elsewhere.

365,1.0,"Context
==========
I'm a web developer and gamer. I spend at least 15 hours each day every day on the computer using this product and 2 other Razer products. All three products (including this one) were purchased approximately 2 years ago.

My Relationship with Razer
==========
I was a Razer fanboy when I first got all of three of these products. In hindsight, I was about as stupid as people who blindly buy any Apple product.

All three Razer devices I'm writing about have failed. Using a BestBuy warranty, I have replaced them all at some point or another for failing.

I would NOT anymore recommend Razer products to anyone. I apologize to my friends who I raved about their products to, as now they are experiencing the same issues and terrible products I am.

Razer Lycosa Keyboard [This review] (In trash)
Razer Naga Mouse (In trash)
Razer Carcharias Headset (In trash)

Simple Summary Review - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
This keyboard is a very nice looking keyboard that functions decently as a keyboard. However, considering the premium price, I expect that the advertised features work and that this keyboard, at a minimum, functions as a keyboard should with no unexpected and unbelievably frustrating behavior. Unfortunately, not with this product or brand. After going through 2 keyboards over a period of 2 years, I'm throwing this device in the trash where it belongs. I'll never buy a Razer product again.

Pros - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard is truly a beautiful piece of plastic. I'm a particular fan of the matte buttons, which are hard to get dirty and easy to clean.
 - It is perfectly visible and usable in completely dark environments.
 - The buttons are very easy to press, leading to less wrist strain over long periods of time.

Cons - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard has a severe issue of getting stuck signals. It's like a key is stuck, but it's not. The only way to resolve is by unplugging the keyboard. This happens quite regularly, even without using the keyboard at all. I can't count the number of mornings I've woken up, turned on my monitor, only to find my keyboard just a typing an infinitely long Windows password on my locked computer. It's dreadfully annoying in gaming environments. Example: ""Sorry guys, I didn't mean to pull the boss. My keyboard is acting wierd!""
 - The media controller (touchpad) is absolutely useless. I have never gotten it to work, and it always goes crazy. It will regularly turn your volume down. It will constantly flash the keyboard lights. It will always start playing music when you aren't even near your computer. I contacted Razer support, and you know what they suggested? That I put a quarter on it! Yes, it a quarter will completely disable the touchpad. So for the past 2 years, I've been using a quarter to keep my wonky keyboard under my control, sacrificing one of the biggest reasons I wanted the keyboard to begin with.
 - The included USB port doesn't work. The power strength is a fraction of what normal USB ports are from my computer (so charging a phone, for example, takes multiples longer than using a USB port on the back of the computer). In addition, I've yet to get any device to actually function in it. Thumb drives are so convenient to plug in there, but the port simply doesn't work. Yes, I plugged both cables on the keyboard in. It just doesn't work.
 - The lights appear very dull through the buttons. This can be a pro or a con, as the lights shouldn't be distracting. However, I think it's just a little too dull, as it looks like the lights are failing. Pop a key off, though, and it's plain to see that the actual light source underneath is insanely bright.

In Hindsight
==========
I wish I had more nice things to say, but unfortunately, the truth is what it is. I wish I wasn't initially blinded by brand name, and I wish I would have done more research. Unfortunately, the past is the past, and the money spent on these 3 Razer products is lost forever. I hope Razer can fix their products in future generations, but I will never give them another shot. This is a premium product with a premium design. However, the functionality of their devices are equivalent of cheap knock-offs made in China.",-0.020018942509454844

 How many horrible things about this game can I mention?Let's see,oh yeah,your weapons and armor level up by tossing them into a pond,and depending on what the weather is like,it get's weaker or stronger...sound stupid?Wait there's more!

 You can only use skills(spells/special moves) if you're wearing certain weapons or armor. Levels mean nothing;no learning cool spells by leveling up the old fashoined way,all you have to do is sport the right threads! WOW!

 You only get a certain amount of EXP depending on how many levels the monster is stronger or weaker than you. I guess just having a set amount of EXP for each monster is just too much to ask! Let's make something even more complex even though you already have to learn 5000 diffrent rules just to play this peice of junk!

 Don't be fooled by thinking that this game has two worlds... this game always takes place in the online game""the world"";the real world is just the computer desktop with that annoying music.
All you do on the desktop is read pointless e-mails that tell you
boring ...,and if you don't kiss every character's ... in the game they'll get mad at you and won't play with you....oh,darn!

 As for the whole ""illusion"" of being on an online virtual world,
that's a total joke! The dungeon graphics are VERY bland and repetitive; in fact if it wasn't for the flashy cutscenes,this could easily be put on the playstation 1!Oh,and the other ""online players"" say the same three things over and over, including the ones that join your party!

 And as for the whole story,I just didn't care! It doesn't ever make you WANT to find out what happens next. The plot isn't gripping at all;I mean yeah,you're friend goes into a coma,but as to why he did,it's just abstract and stupid. Some ghost chic get's chased by a guy with a pink staff and then he beats your friend with it! UGH!! And you're telling me that Bandai wants to drag this out to three more sequals!?

 Also,controlling the camera manually gets really,really old! At first it might seems like a good idea,but you'll get a headache constantly switching the camera back and forth. It gets tiresome doing this just when walking in a dungeon,but when you've got a group of enemies that always run out of view....

 Lastly,the music was completely indistinct and unnoticeable; Super Mario Bros. 1 had better music than this!

-No PvP
-No Ladder
-Crafting system is useless, neither of the 2 crafters are worth the time or effort (costs more to combine gems than to buy them on the Gold AH lol)
-No build diversity, every class is forced into one of very few viable builds come end-game with no room for experimentation
-Botters, hackers, gold farmers all run rampant and this is an ONLINE ONLY game
-ONLINE ONLY, no offline mode whatsoever and they stated there never will be
-Can level a character from 1 - 60 (max level) in under 24 hours
-Normal mode is ridiculously easy, where Inferno is almost impossible unless you're willing to buy your way through it
-Game can be beat in 4 hours
-No end-game at all, once you finish the game for the 4th time in a row there is literally nothing left. Sure you can continue to farm items, but for what? You've beaten all the PvE and there is no PVP
-Loot system is broken
-Developers will nerf items and stats dramatically without any warning whatsoever, making items completely useless (spend 20$ on an awesome sword yesterday only to have it nerfed? too bad, buy a new one)
-Online latency problems
-Dwindling player population (players are leaving in droves, for reasons stated above)
-Story is the worst, most over-the-top ridiculous piece of literature to ever be written
-Lame bosses, lame enemies
-No ""free mode"" - meaning every time you play through the game, no matter how many times you beat it, you're still forced to watch the same cutscenes and hear the same dialog over and over and over and over

My issue with the game as it currently stands is that after paying $80 for the collector's edition I was excited to get the early access to the game. I downloaded the early access and I was unable to even create a character due to error messages. That was my first issue, I thought it would be fixed by launch date so I wasn't concerned.

Well my second issue which many of you that order the game currently will run into is that Square Enix has completely shut off character creation currently because their servers are completely full. Which leaves me with a game I am unable to play. I have heard from others that actually made a character on the game that they have to sit in ques for hours to get on the game each time.

400,1.0,"First off, it must be pointed out that even when this game was new no one was demanding a Porky Pig game. Until The Looney Tunes Show gave the character a new lease on life as a downtrodden everyman, Porky had not been relevant since 1971.

Putting that aside, though ... very little thought went into this game. Ostensibly this game is vaguely based on the cartoon ""Scaredy Cat,"" in which Porky Pig and Sylvester spend the night in a house Porky doesn't realize is haunted. The first level is spent in a spooky woods full of ghosts, which fits the theme; then the second level is set in the Old West. Well then.

Porky responds to the controls poorly. In most of the Acclaim Warner Brothers games the problem was too much character fidelity; they were so worried about making the characters move like cartoons that the animations were allowed to get in the way of gameplay. F'rexample, in Death Valley Rally the Road Runner stands up stiff-straight when still and leans forward horizontally when moving, making it very difficult to judge where the Road Runner would end up when you moved the D-pad. Here, though, Porky is constantly making weird faces and his movement is slow and choppy. It feels like he's moving through treacle and the animation doesn't look anything like it should. I'd say the code wasn't optimized, but I can't imagine even Acclaim letting a game out the door without that.

The level design is essentially random. In the first stage, lots of platforms lead nowhere; frequently the only way to advance is to fall into a pit and wander around until Porky finds a spot where Daffy will scream at him and cause him to jump to the next section of the game. Enemies are either easily avoided or impossible to avoid; one long section that might have offered some challenge can be completely skipped just by bouncing off the head of a nearby flying enemy. Another section consists of ascending and descending a tree trunk (in terribly done Mode7) with one mistake jumping between the minuscule platforms sending you falling WAY down.

The first boss is not animated. I don't mean ""is poorly animated."" It has only a handful of frames and jumps back and forth between them like the old LCD games, and throws white McDonalds logos at you. Depending on whether it randomly throws them low or high the boss is either pathetically easy or unreasonably difficult.

The next level is a Western, as noted, and Porky simply runs from left to right through a ghost town. It's hard to tell what's a platform and what's not and frequently impossible to avoid taking a hit from the enemy.

This was the point at which I lost patience. Should you decide to invest in this putrid piece of programming, may you have a stronger stomach than I did. Meanwhile, I'm going to go make myself a ham sandwich.",-0.015842343276175043

403,1.0,"I don't think I'll ever get used to this mouse. I bought it to help control some of the interface buttons in GW2, but it's so complex I'm back to the keyboard.

First problem - Size. I imagine I have a standard hand size. Was this thing designed for skinny giants? My thumb isn't close to long enough to push these buttons. I'm forced to hover my hand over the top of the mouse to use all but two side buttons.

Second problem - 3rd mouse button. I must click this button a hundred times an hour on accident. When your third finger leaves mouse button 2 to use the wheel or it's functions the fourth finger is going to click the third button my accident every single time. So now my ring finger is off the mouse and onto the mousepad.

Third problem - Mouse 1, 2 and 3 don't feel like clicks. There's almost no gap between the button and it's switch. This contributes to normal finger weight accidentally pushing the mouse buttons. There's little vibration feedback, and the click is so quiet you'll not hear it. So I'm not really sure if I even clicked the button most of the time.

Fourth problem - Extremely poor G9-G20 button design. Again, I can't reach any but the middle buttons to begin with which leads to not being sure what button my fingers are on if I move off them. Despite the two middle buttons having tabs, I can't feel if my finger is on them or not because the buttons also have edges that feel like... yep... tabs. Seriously, I have to look at my mouse now to know where my fingers are. Sure if i'm surfing I have time to figure this out, but in the middle of complex combat when you're dodging and strafing it's extremely difficult. I think these buttons need to be placed in a much deeper concave to really work well. Or, just get rid of four of them and make the others larger. Anything but trying to pack 12 buttons in such a small area.

Overall I'm disappointed. It doesn't work for me, it's not ergonomic the way I have to use it, it feels like really cheap plastic. I don't really care about the money spent, but can't think of a positive thing to say about this device. Unfortunately I never found this mouse out of box at any store I visited before buying. The box design is such that it lies in the box forcing you to hover over the mouse and not at any angle you would use it at. So it feels great until you go to use it.

I still love Logitech, no matter what my experience with this mouse was.

Update after 2 weeks of use:

Everything in my initial review still holds true, with some additional negative feedback.

I programmed the mouse wheel left-click to change weapons, and click it by accident all the time. This is really painful and has interfered with my gaming so much it's now going to be another useless button for me. On a mouse with so many buttons, I'm running out of USABLE buttons.

Maybe I'm blind, but I just now discovered the G7 and G8 buttons located beneath the mouse wheel. Not lit, colored black with black labels. Wow. I have no clue how anyone could possibly use these buttons in a game without removing their hand from the mouse to push them. Someone with a finger sticking out of their palm must have placed them there.

Of all my gripes, the worst one isn't about the design of the G600. The G600 software/drivers is causing LAG in my keyboard. I initially thought it was LAG in the game, I'm pushing buttons without the corresponding game action (cast, move). I'm pushing the key two or three times to get a spell off while in combat. I blamed the game for the last two weeks thinking they deployed a bugged patch, but after some testing figured out it wasn't the game - it was the G600 causing a conflict with my keyboard. I have a top notch gaming rig getting 150 FPS in BF3 and I get lag from a mouse.

I'm being completely honest in this review. I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone and have used it long enough where I should have gotten used to it. I would still buy Logitech, but will be much more critical and demand a hands on before purchasing.",-0.005049944832872521
404,1.0,"I can't belief what reviews I am seeing here - are we talking about the same game? As I am a fan of the old colonization, I was thrilled to see it come back to life, though under the Civ4 cover. I even pre-ordered it to have right from the start. Since I do not own Civilization4, I have no way of comparing the two games and can not draw from experience from Civ4.

Unfortunately the documentation in the manual and the help in the game itself are insufficient to answer my questions. Here a few points that ruin the overall rating and should be addressed in a patch ASAP, since it will make the game much more accessible for new players.

-In the game setup, the effect of one's choice of the game speed is not explained. (I.E. Marathon = higher cost of materials for building, more gold needed for purchases, more storage in settlements and most important - more turns until the deadline)

-In the diplomacy menu, the names of the native leaders mean nothing to me - the tribe name would help! It makes for ""fun"" diplomacy if you have to go back and forth to figure who is who and where on the map they are.

-I can't see how many turns I have to wait for my ""Expert Farmer"" to be done in the native village (yes, I do have that progress bar, but I saw it full for 10 marathon-turns and still no farmer) What if I have multiple students in the village?

-How does the education system work? Sometimes it takes 20 turns for a graduate, or 115, there is no information whatsoever on what influences the training time. If you only have a set number of turns, would you not want to know what you need to do to get specialists faster? I do!

-How do I train veteran soldiers? In the old game my soldiers would eventually get the veteran status if they fought enough battles. So far no veterans here.

There is no information about the other players, the options of interaction are very limited an make them very plain.

Somehow the AI must be confused. Here I had Spain ask for help and push for war with a native tribe(who only had 2 villages). A few turns later they declared war without my help and, behold, the natives nearly wipe them out in ONE TURN. All major Spanish settlements - gone! Just 3 Colonists in 2 settlements left. Odd!

Some of the benefits of the founding fathers are not clear. What is a ""50% faster production of Church, Cathedral"" mean? 50% faster construction? 50% more crosses? Some hard to get to founding fathers only offer a lousy one time bonus (like John Paul Jones).

On a preferential note, I find the game too short. In normal speed the game is plainly frustrating! In no time the ""Just 100 more turns"" pops up. Fortunately Marathon saved it for me.

The royal army is insanely HUGE! Even if most of my colonists are made into soldiers it is much bigger then anything I can field - and I was playing at the lowest difficulty setting!

The world is disappointingly small! Set on the ""HUGE"" setting one stumbles over the other Europeans within the first few turns.

I think were I to restart that chapter, I'd have a slim chance of completing it were I to equip all my units with the handful of weapons that would be useful for it-but I'm still doubtful I'd be able to beat it.

Even aside from the absurd level of difficulty (on what I believe was it's easiest of five or six difficulty settings), the story through the point I reached was almost nonexistant.

423,1.0,"This game is very frustrating. It is so easy to lose a battle. If just ONE character falls in combat you have to start over. Would have preferred a way to resurrect players during combat so you can finish the dungeons.

The AI is punishing. They annihilate your weakest characters with ease. Even the AI's melee units start throwing dynamite and become ranged units making your melee fighter near useless. Character stance is useless when dynamite is constantly knocking your guys down.

Graphics are not that great for a next gen game.

Battles usually end lop sided when you try to get all of the treasure in a dungeon. New monsters show up and chase you down. It is very difficult to out run these new over-powerful monsters, and if you lose just one character the whole dungeon must be replayed. This is a seriously frustrating waste of time.

429,1.0,"First, I have not purchased this game and won't until it is STEAM free. This game is wrapped with STEAM so STEAM is a legitimate issue, even if it is the only issue.

Now .. . . I've read virtually all the reviews of this product and have some things I want to say:

1) STEAM is not a product protection service, and does not discourage piracy. As most of you know, anyone can download a pirated copy of any popular game in a matter of days.
2) STEAM serves no purpose other than being a marketing platform for products. Sure, ya don't have to care for a DVD if ya download a game and ya have to keep your key . . . big deal. And ya, it may be convenient to find your friends to play an online game with, and various other small time benefits to make users feel they are getting something great by having STEAM on their computer . . . but . . .
3) WindowsBlowUp is hard enough to keep working properly without some resource hog that can't be controlled starting up, as if WindowsBlowsUp doesn't have enough unnecessary processes already.
4) STEAM is a horrible security risk. To see a discussion of this go to []. BTW, I would not be surprised in the least if STEAM had already been compromised. Buy a good book on computer forensics. The stories of companies getting hacked, getting their files stolen, paying a ransom, and NOT reporting it to stockholders let alone the public is stunning.
5) Programmers are notorious for leaving backdoors in programs. If ya don't know what a backdoor is, or are skeptical go to this link -[], and you will see how vulnerable computer users are.
6) STEAM server is secure? Think again. It takes one skilled system wise programmer working in the STEAM server installation to download all the customer information onto a portable device and sell it to the highest bidder.
7) Some reviews and comment talk about the ""ethical"" and ""moral"" character and responsibility of corporations. Hogwash! Enron had an corporate ""ethics"" policy too! Remember Enron? If not look it up. I worked for years in business and there is only a couple rules companies (most of them) follow. Executives focus on personal advancement above all else, and the corporation will do whatever it takes to ensure its continued existence, and growth and will exterminate any threat if possible using whatever means it thinks it can get away with. Profit IS everything!
8) Anyone who thinks that STEAM is concerned about individual user satisfaction is delusional. STEAM is concerned only by numbers and statistics. Really . . . if STEAM was concerned about user experience, there would be a check box which gave the consumer the ability to completely disable STEAM until the time the consumer wanted to connect to get the patches or look at products available.
9) I predict that when STEAM (if and/or when they do) gets a market share that is great enough to monopolize the gaming market, they will increase the price of the product, charge for the service, etc.
10) I use as an example MicrosoftBlowsUp as an example. As an operating system it sucks donkey balls and is way over priced. Ubuntu is way better and free too. Any program you want is available for FREE. Every driver you could ever want is included as a loadable module so ya don't have to install drivers for your printer, or any other peripheral you use. Never defrag, no corrupt registry or files, secure, and fast. MicrosoftBlowsUp has used every trick it can to maximize its profits and extinguish any competition to the detriment of the consumer. STEAM will do exactly the same thing IF it gains enough market share. That's why I dumped my PC's and just spent $4000 buying two MacBook Pro's.
11) I've had multiple STEAM accounts ""restricted"" for who know what reason, have had download times that were in the 12 - 20 hour range for game data, STEAM not available so I can't play my game, and others report corrupt files, game patches being installed that make game saves obsolete, support only through e-mails and very slow too. Go to the STEAM forums to find all the complains of service, or days of non-service. Lets not forget the pop-up ads. For those with bandwidth limitations this uncontrollable service can be a killer and can put the user over their limit with sometimes extremely costly over-usage charges.
12) Let me list just some of the problems STEAM causes the consumer (all these comments come from 1 star reviews):
  ""I have a rather stingy 450MB daily download limit so it REALLY pisses me off that a friggin' video game publisher would presume to waste my bandwidth with an always on connection and download updates uncontrollably.""
  ""At present, I have been waiting for two hours for Civ V to load, for it's been trying to install an update for that period.""
  ""[STEAM] . .. is intrusive and a waste of system resources.""
  ""I've written repeated e-mails to Steam support and 2K Games and get the automated response that I will be contacted within 72 hours. I never am contacted.""
  ""I have yet to have a game that is attached to STEAM that doesnt crash. Left for Dead 2? yup crashes CONSTANTLY, if not on my end then ineveitably someone I am playing with crashes. Half life? Yup there too.""
  ""Also, if your internet connection hiccups, the game connection is lost, and everything locks up.""
  "" . . . the install process forces the user to install stream and the updates, which requires about nine hours of time.""
  "" . . . steam spyware would not let me play the first evening because the 'servers were overloaded'""
  ""On a final note: Steam? Really? Took about 2 hours to get past the ""our servers are too busy"" message.""

  So now equal time to the STEAM fanboy's. Virtually all these quotes come from 4 and 5 star reviews:
  ""Steam support is responsive and has handled easy questions well.""
  ""Steam represents nothing more than a large part of the reason that PC gaming is still alive and well today.""
  ""Anyone who complains about Steam is either deluded or completely misinformed. ""
  ""Steam integration is good news IMO - I love Steam - features like Cloud saves, In game overlay, automatic updates and many others are very usefull to me and my friends.""
  ""With steam, you do not have to be online to play your games. Steam has an offline mode, which allows you to play all of your games just fine even if you don't want to be online.""
  ""Steam is a great service, once again, I have been using Steam for over 4 years now, and most of the time, I never have problems downloading, or playing the games!""
  ""I happen to love Steam. I've been using it since 2003 and I have purchased over 200 games for the platform. It has been an invaluable program for my gaming hobby for years.""
  ""Steam is great for those who have never used it. Sure you don't technicaly own the games you buy off of steam but are they really going to take your liscence away? But it easily manages your games, friends, downloads, patches, and the games are cheap . . . ""
  ""As far as 'Steam' is concerned, I have downloaded this game, (and others), and have had no problems with it. I have enjoyed it's service in fact. I don't know what all the fuss against it is about.""
  Comments from 3 star reviews:
  ""First of all I have to mention Steam is nothing but a huge pain in the butt. From the initial download/install it constanty accesses the internet to do whatever it wants... not to mention the slow load times while connecting to steam is very annoying.""
  ""I don't have a problem with Steam since I use it for other games but this really irritates me.""

And finally another happy consumer (rating the game as 3 stars):
  ""I agree with everyone else who said ""STEAM SUCKS"". It's okay, actually, for download-only games... I don't mind it. I also don't mind the activation scheme. What I do mind is how much it degrades the initial and very important installation experience, and how you have to run steam to run the game -- I hate that! You screw up the install process and you put the user in a really bad mood right away -- not good.

It took me thirty minutes of watching steam say ""Checking file 1 of 1"" and two restarts of the installation to figure out that it was, in the background, downloading a 4.6GB update for Civ IV, along with 2 other updates totalling 2.0GB!!!! AND IT NEVER EVEN TOLD ME! So, I paused all the downloads and clicked the ""Play Now"" button next to Civ V, got a loading screen, then a dialog box that really p*ss*d me off: It said ""Updating"" with a greyed out ""Play Now"" button.""",-0.0036943248581387737

I have been a fan of the series, and was pretty excited about Stronghold 3. Delayed after delayed the developers claimed to be holding back, because they were going to release the greatest Stronghold of all. Boy! was I disappointed by this installment.

The graphic was okay and an improvement overall. It's fully 3D modeling but it looks very outdated. The voice acting was on par, not good nor it's bad. What pushed me over was the cut scene. It's black and white sketches. Seriously, they didn't even put any effort in to even trying. They pretty much just took what the artist drew during the game's concept and based the whole thing on that. At least color it and paint it... I've never seen a $49.99 game this lazy before, if it was an indie game it would be different.

The walls are rather weak, the stone walls felt like they were made out of sticks. Catapult shots, BOOM!!! Big explosions, as if it was directed by Michael Bay. The arrows and projectile goes right through the walls. There's no advantage for defending. What's the point of a stronghold? The map size is tiny, and small at best. There is no skirmish.

The unit pathing is terrible. I thought my units were just loafing, but they were actually stuck on the ground. This is especially bad in combat, since they're stuck your units are just sitting ducks.

I often lose my units because it's so hard trying to find them. They sometime ""hide"" next to building, trees etc. Only way I could find them were if I click and hold my mouse and drag it in large area and see if I selected something. There should be an icon on the left for your units, at the very least icon for the Lord or hero units.

The game is very buggy and glitchy. I can't believe it made it out to production. What a waste of money for gamers. Do not support this type of behavior from a game developer!

Stronghold Crusader was the best of all. If you're looking to play Stronghold, go play that one.

They say to have more than 4 feet of room - I was doing this in my great room which has much more than that free all around, it's where we play the kinect as well.  So space isn't the issue.

They say to use old batteries - so I pulled out my multimeter, found the lowest rechargeable AA batteries I had that would still power the unit.  No joy.

They say turn off lights and close the curtains, get the room darker.  No luck.

They say turn off the TV during the calibration so there's no interference.  No difference.

In about 45 minutes of holding in all the curse words I didn't want to say in front of my increasingly saddened birthday boy, I finally managed to get it to do the calibration.  And then I though I was home free.  Until the voiceover tells you about the next step in calibration, which is stepping on the back of the board to tilt it up.  That failed, because it said I wasn't covering the sensor enough.  That was not the problem though, since at one point I was so frustrated with it, that I put duct tape over the back sensor and tilted it.  Still I was told the back sensor wasn't covered.

442,1.0,"Despite all the hype and all the delays, ""Tomb Raider: The Angel Of Darkness"" turns out to be just a waste of plastic. The game would've been great had the designers taken the time to fix up the unacceptable amount of bugs and glitches, and come up with a new and different style of gameplay.
What do I mean by that? Every single movement Lara makes is animated and much slower than it ought to be. A three-legged dog with one eye could swim through a pool of molasses in less time than it takes Lara to run from one side of a room to another. Not only that, but simple actions like crouching take at least 3 seconds longer than they should. And don't get me started on jumping. Jumping from ledge to ledge is about the only task the developers could come up with for you to do. Apparently, it's the camera's job to make it seem a lot harder than it is. If the camera's turned just slightly to the wrong angle, you might end up doing a side flip to your doom instead of jumping forward.
The puzzles that you come across (rarely), are usually idiotic and unrealistic. At one point in the game, you're asked to get from one side of a room to another, unfortunately the only way the door on the other end will open is if the laser security system is activated. The first thing you should notice is that these lasers are very poorly placed and any real person could easily just step over them or duck under them. Of course, being the tomb raider she is, Lara must use a series of timed run-and-jump moves to get through them, making what would be an extremely easy sequence to get through into a much harder one.
You'll learn early to save all the time. The game is extremely glitchy and freezes up in certain areas, usually when there's lots of things going on at the same time (like when three lights are turned on and there's another guy in the room). Also, since Lara dies inconsistently, you'll never know if that jump to the floor below is too far or not. I found that in certain areas, a ten foot fall to the floor can result in death, while in other places, falling forty feet will only slightly hurt your life bar.
Then there's all those nagging questions. Why is it that setting yourself on fire will slowly drain Lara's health, but stepping into a laser can kill you instantly? How come it takes seven bullets to kill a guy with no body armor? What kind of dog dies after two kicks, but remains alive after being shot several times? What's the point in the stealth mode if you almost never have to use it? In the extras section, why do the game designers claim that '""Tomb Raider"" has always set the benchmark for games'? Why does the ""Cradle Of Life"" movie trailer have such messed up audio? I could go on and on.
In conclusion, all I have to say is that ""AOD"" was not worth the wait and isn't worth your money. Save it. I hope Eidos decides to speed up the gameplay in the next ""Tomb Raider"" installment and gets some developers that aren't mental patients to work on it.

3.  The age progession should be able to be turned off, as I didn't get to accomplish what I needed or wanted to.
4.  My sim was watching t.v. and couldn't get up from the sofa, and died of hunger.
5.  No firemen to put out house fires.  My stove caught on fire, and sim did too, and died.  Why are fire alarms
  needed?
6.  People walk through people, cars jam up into each other.
7.  There was a logjam of people at the entrance to the restaurant, and they ended up dying.
8.  You find yourself ""mourning"" and don't know why until you figure out that there are various tombstone markers
  around town from Sims that have died, that you have to put in your inventory and place them at the cemetery.
9.  Once you choose an outfit/hair-- you cannot change them.
10. You cannot build homes.
11. Books- I have no idea how to read certain ones (i.e., cooking) once I've purchased them.  Once they are

What I'm going to do is go onto the next step: how do you get your freaking money back? The good news is that if you bought it from Amazon, you'll be able to do so with not too much difficulty, even if you downloaded digitally. Just make sure to do it now, though -- if you hold onto the game for over a week, I think you're out of luck.

Now let's say you're a poor sap who bought the game from the SimCity website directly. I feel your pain. And their customer service is legendarily poor (sidebar: I remember getting into it with one of their reps about my Rock Band 2 equipment that broke EXACTLY three months after I bought it. It was unreal.) -- there have been multiple reports of being threatened with a total account ban if you dare dispute their refund policy.

So this is what it comes down to: dispute it on your credit card or through your bank. (or through Paypal, but that will take a much longer time and be a bigger pain in the butt) I disputed through Chase and there wasn't a problem -- they give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're telling the truth about what happened -- then they investigate your claim and make their decision. I don't think I've ever had a dispute of mine turned down, because they've all come down to this basic idea: you're not getting what you paid for. And when you don't get what you paid for -- ta-da! you get your money back! what an idea!

Some games are incredibly easy.  I can take down enemies with two rounds.  Opponents don't have time to raise their weapons.  In fact, their efforts are comical.  I roll over opponent after opponent getting my little blood bath emblems.  My highest kill to death ratio is 15.  My dad is the ref and he's calling shots to make me win.  Winning like that sucks.

Other times, I empty a magazine of bullets into an enemy, right smack in their face, and watch what should be their death be mine.  I usually watch the killcams out of morbid curiosity.  Oddly, the enemy's perspective is the exact opposite of mine.  He's looking at a comical idiot firing at a wall and puts me out of my misery with two shots.

Activision has put together a beautiful game.  The graphics are unparalleled.  The gameplay should be fun.  Everything is there on paper.

But they totally jacked up the simplest mechanics.  The core truth of this game: Activision is guessing.  Activision has no clue who fired first.  Or who rounded the corner first.  They're throwing programming and networking at human reaction time.  And believe it or not, the humans are much faster.  Four or five times faster as far as I can tell.

The game breaks down pretty quickly.  I will be honest.  I enjoy playing it.  But when I win, it's always a bit too easy and there's a lot of guilt.  And when I lose, I want to hurl the controller.  The timing is a hell of a thing for Activision to botch.  But that's exactly what happened.  It's the worst game of the series.

I refuse to buy the expansion pack.  If you want more from the franchise, I suggest you don't even buy the game.  Activision needs to go back to basics and figure out sub 100ms gaming.  Or they need to get some servers involved.",0.008864213272108012

After the Combat upgrade the game went down hill, they added alot of silly things from the EverQuest 2 game that does NOT make any sence at all in starwars..and its far 2 buggy.

I will give them a little tiem to fix it and take it away ( and I guess they will not cause they are so smart ) bah!  Help Lucas where are you?!

Starwars was a more serious game, playd by both young AND old..noe people are leaving in hordes..50 % of the Chimaera server left cause of the Combat upgrade..old players..are getting rare in soem places...they go to Guild wars or WoW..

So overall play for my part is runined in this game, and I do not see if a layal fan don't even like it ( yes i like fanatasy, but this in SWG now is just silly )anyothers will think its a crap game.

Please Lucas! take charge! let us have back the star wars as in the movies, we don't want Star Quest ( as starwars now looks like everQuest..which sux and is silly )

so save yer money buy World of warcraft or Guildwars!

Let me explain: the game itself is amazingly designed, although a pretty linear type of RPG. You can read any review on what makes this a good game and those reviews are probably spot on. Here's why I'm giving it a 1-star, though.
For a game that lets you make choices, there are a few important places where the choices are so limited that you have to make a choice that you'd never make in real life, or given more options.
But even worse, at some point, giving the answer that you might think is the right one (the honest answer) will get your game to come to an abrupt end. A complete game over. Meaning, you'll have to go back, and figure out which answer the developers want you to give. In short, you don't get to give the answers that YOU would want to give.

Updated:
after going back and changing my answers to (unnamed character), the story moves forward, and they spend a good 10-15 minutes in cut scenes explaining what happened and why it makes sense.

The mini games are the highlight, seeing as the main game is uncontrolable and generally bad.

The PC version is not user friendly in the least! You will be able to install your game but unable to play it on vista! I have checked around on 7 different sites, no one can give a straight answer to the problem! Even if you manage to play the game it does have a lot of glitching and freezing at some points, mostly while opening things and running around a lot. But from time to time throwing grenades can also trigger it. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is fun, customizing is average as I would have liked to choose from a variety f faces, attires, and saber styles for the get go. Choosing your path is a bit too straight forward it seems, but all and all it is a fun game. Once you have beaten it about 3 times you are ready to retire it for a LONG time. After a year or two you may go back to it again, only to realize it's shear simplicity. That said, once I was able to play the game smoothly the first few times, it was pretty epic considering when it came out and all. Comparing it to games today it still gets a fairly decent score in the fun department. I would still give it 7/10 for the fun and back then a 9/10. So why the one star?

532,1.0,"My grading scale with Wii Games looks like this ...

5 star = A must play. No improvements need to be made. Has replay value (this is very important). I do not give out 5 star reviews open-heartedly. I consider any game worth playing, and owning is a 4 star game (which is my way of saying its 5 stars). Im very strict on 5 stars.

4 star = Even if its my favorite game for the Wii, I will hand out 4 stars to it cause I can view some improvements to be made. OR it does not have replay value (meaning I played it once, I loved it but Im not gonna play it again). Either way, it was a game I would prefer over its competition / genre. I like to give any great game 4 stars just so I can leave some room for a potential 5 star future improvement of the game.

3 star = Playable and fun game, I would recommend it but there may be a better alternative (a game that received a 4 star in the same genre)

2 star = Not worth playing. No need to purchase. Much better games out there in the same genre.

1 star = Silly game. A waste of time. No need to bother.

And now we can continue with the actual review for Wii Sports ... First of all, I am a 24 year old male. I am not happy seeing a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews for this game. Its as if no other games were played therefore the reviewers had nothing to compare the game to. I can understand that as Wii Sports comes with a new Nintendo Wii. This is not a hot launch title like Super Mario 64 was for the N64. In no way should this game have the same review rating as Super Mario 64. I would give this game a 1.5 as it is 5 games in one but ratings need to be lowered! As to not fool anybody out there that this is a hot product, because it is NOT. I am one that relies on Amazon reviews for a lot of the products I buy. So I do not want to be misinformed. People who purchase the Nintendo Wii spend their time playing hot titles like Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, Resident Evil 4, Mariokart Wii, etc. THIS GAME, ""Wii Sports"" can be seen left in its packaging unopened by a Wii owner. If I could sell this game I'd be happy. If you purchase a Wii that does not have Wii Sports, please purchase a different game. As I'm sure you can always borrow this from a friend. In fact, they may very well give it to you. I would.

So lets look at this game ... The title of this review is ""too much intrinsic ratings"". What I mean by this is the high ratings are given to this game because it has a strong relationship with the Nintendo Wii console. Nintendo Wii is of great success (and even having this Wii Sports game included with it, I would still offer 5 stars to Nintendo Wii). But this individual game needs to be reviewed for the game that it is. And not a psychological view that 1) it is mutual with the Nintendo Wii (dont want to give a bad review to the game that piggybacks with a remarkable console), or 2) it is often the first game played on the Nintendo Wii. In fact being the most handed out game (how often are hand outs considered popular?) this game has only received less than 20 reviews. Maybe its because hardcore gamers have no interest in this game, or never bothered to play it. As I had no intention playing this game when I purchased my first Nintendo Wii.

So lets look at what it offers ... these are all short games. Nothing competitive, or innovative. An introduction as other reviewers have mentioned. This is more like a demo. Or a tutorial for the real version of the games. And is very PONGY.

Baseball ... only 3 innings. Cant play defense. Use no thought. You just pitch, and bat. While the computer plays the fielders. No double plays can be made, no pick-offs. I consider it an 80's baseball version of pong. It is very simplicit. What I mean by this is when you hit the ball, as soon as the fielder touches it, it will tell you whether you received a single, a double, or a triple. Can you imagine playing a baseball game on an 80's computer? Where it tells you what happens. Yes, like that. You don't tell the runners where to go or have ANY interaction with the fielders. Its very basic. Pitch the ball by swinging down. Then hit the ball by swinging across. And thats IT. Let the computer take care of the rest. No buttons need to be pushed in this game.

Tennis ... this game reminded me when I was in Las Vegas. I played a game called ""Ace Tennis"" on one of those virtual game touch-screen machines at a bar. Again, its very simple, just swing the remote at the right time. Doesnt take any thought. The ball seems to always go over the net and land in the same spot everytime. You can do this with your eyes closed. And not to mention but when playing single player, you play on a team of two. I played best out of 5 games, and best out of 3 games, the player on my team NEVER hit the ball. He was just a stand in, I did all the work. The same was true on the opponents team, he just slid back and forth along the net, didn't do anything unless I hit a slow one just over the net. And he'll finally pong it back to me. I literally spent 5 minutes going back and forth with the tennis ball. Just same ol same ol. Opponent doesnt make mistakes (he did once though I'll admit so consider it rare).

Boxing ... first day I got my Wii (I had no other games) I couldn't sleep that night. So I got up at 1:30am. Didnt have anything to do at the computer so I played Wii Sports. I had played Wii Sports for over an hour earlier that day to get used to the game. It was kind of fun at first cause you're learning the game and wondering if this really is that 4+ star game!! ... so I get up at 1:30am and I really didn't want to play it but I had no choice lol. I searched through the game TRYING to find a reason to like it but I couldnt. Boxing is probably my favorite sport here. I spent an hour boxing. It gets harder after each fight you win. Eventually after an hour you get frustrated cause you cant get any punches through and it tires you out. The controls are a little tricky too. Punches I wanted to do would rarely register (the low or side punches). You can literally win rounds with nothing but high punches (which is keeping the remotes in front of your head and swinging down as if you're beating a drum). That simple. But the only reason I liked the boxing is cause it was a nice workout for the arms. After an hour you will feel a light sweat, become a little tired, you feel the blood pumping through your arm. So boxing is something I can consider apart of a workout plan. But there could be a much better option like Wii Fit, or a more in-depth boxing game like Facebreaker for example. In fact the mini games on Rayman Raving Rabbids gave me a better workout when I was beating a drum listening to a song. It made me move my body as I rhythm'd to the beat.

Golf ... frustrating. I'm not a golf fan myself. This isn't Tiger Woods here, you cant customize, or play in competitive championships. Im sure Carnival games: MiniGolf is a much better option. Brings you more into the game. This golf here is very basic. You hit the ball in the hole, try to make par, and then you do it again lol. Very ""pong-y""

Bowling ... bowling was hard for me. I didn't really master it. I had fun when I first played. Though having been without a game console for 6 months I was quite eager to play a Nintendo Wii again so I was thrilled no matter what I played =)

And that sums up my review. This is a very PONGY game, as in basic / beginner / tutorial / demo. Its not your top of the line sport game here. I really hope this isn't viewed as a remarkable game for the Wii. I think the future of gaming has yet to come, Nintendo Wii being apart of that future and this game is just not it. Its pong. And you sure don't want to spend $30? on this game. Wow. I think the market is overpriced on that. Especially with so many in production it will greatly drop in value with time. I personally might play this game again. As I mentioned, boxing is a light workout. And Tennis is a virtual game I played at a bar having some drinks. So I wouldnt mind re-living that memory. And thats about it. Dont give yourself high expectations for this game coming from an adult perspective. For your child, they'll find more fun to it but still better alternatives for them ===",0.025252425058724375

I have played bioware games since KOTOR and have yet to see them put out a such a steaming, bug filled pile as this. If you told me that the extent of their testing this game was one quick play through by some random junkie, who had never played an RPG, and was stoned out of his mind the whole time, I'd believe you. There is a glitch where the player character's attack speed gets progressively slower and slower. Thus turning fast paced button slapping action into an unbearably dull and exceedingly frustrating affair. I hear that this glitch is made worse by being a mage, which I was. I had to replay hours of the game to undo the slowdown only for it crop back up over and over until I gave in. My friend who has this game as well was a mage and was unable to avoid the glitch. He ended up selling the game without finishing it. It is said that you can slow down so much that your character will no longer attack at all. *<*< THIS GLITCH IS CONFIRMED ON ALL PLATFORMS!

Actual Game Review: Duke is still the man, even today
Score: 5 out of 5

Ok, the only DN game i ever played fully was Duke Nukem Zero Hour, so i decided to try antoher one, and TTK seemed like a great choice since it resembled Zero Hour.....and it's just as awesome, the weapons are amazing with my personal favorite being the shotgun and the level design is fun and not to repetitive. Graphics wise it's not that bad, but it's a PS1 game from 1996, but graphics don't make the game, look at Metal Gear or Resident Evil, and Duke Nukem is just as fun as those two.

Lets say i was very impressed with gameplay and how fluent it worked.... remember i am only in the tutorial.  After i finished tutorial i went to the saga.  Now being someone that owned all budokai's i was expecting a decent length and substancial storyline.  To say the least i was wrong.  I finished the story that night.  I mean what a rip i only got up to the cell saga?  I came in thinking it was all the way through to buu at least and had all the characters i came to love in budokai tenkaichi 3, seeing as that only makes sense.  What really bothers me is after each saga they fabricate a movie based on gameplay to wrapup what happened.  I think this space and time could have been better put into including a buu saga.  I mean most people just skip these low budget in game movies anyway, so why not give us something we want.  When i buy a game i buy it for substance some good gameplay.  Not half of a game with better graphics.  Btw they include the first disk of season one ......  Season one came out over a year ago and most of us fans already bought it.  Why give out something we already own.  Even worse why give out part of a season where you will still have to go out and buy the whole thing if you don't own it.  I mean seriousl what are we going to do with one out of six disks in a set.  Just a way to get ppl to sink more money into this franchise.  I strongly urge everyone to rent this game before buying so you can see exactly what its worth.  This game to me is WAS worthless and i am ashamed that they would even sell this game in the market let alone sell it for such a steep price.  Trust me you are better off getting something else.

Cons
1.  Game is short only through the cell saga.
2.  Game has cutscenes every 5 seconds during actual fighting which throw you offguard and confuse you.
3.  Maps are incredibly small.  you can successfully hit someone about 2-3 times before you hit a wall.
4.  Gamplay has no learning curve its ez to play with no skill involved
5.  YOU HAVE UNLIMITED SPECIALS with little to no delay before refire. tisk tisk
6.  Limited characters maybe 13 or so.
7.  Transformations make you weaker......why why would they do that.
8.  Game is 100% completed in one night.
9.  Absolutely no replay value at all.  I sold the game first chance i got.
10. When you near the end you hope the game finishes soon because it is soo bady.

Thinking that maybe someone else had had this problem and made a product to solve it, I started searching and was very excited to find that yes, there are companies making solutions.

However, after using this product I've decided that this company is not one of the ones making solutions. This is a poor ergonomic design, and there is nothing comfortable about it. Unfortunately, most grip products are made for the 3DS, not the 3DS XL, so I felt like I had to chance it and try this product since there wasn't much other choice. And I was encouraged by reviews saying it worked well for people with ""large hands"". Well let me tell you, those people must have an inflated opinion of their hand size, because if you actually do have large hands I can't see how you would find this any more comfortable than a 3DS XL that doesn't have the grip! The minute I received this product, I started playing Mario Kart (one of the most uncomfortable games for me due to the control scheme and the necessity of constantly holding down the ""A"" button). My hands were cramping in the very first race, and as usual, I barely finished a single grand prix before I turned the game off and put the 3DS XL away. In fact, they still hurt as I type this review 15 minutes later.

But that's enough generalities... lets talk about specifically ""why"" this is a bad design. It primarily comes down to these few things: First, this grip really doesn't make the 3DS XL much wider, which WILL cause your fingers to squish together to try to press the buttons, especially the A button. Look at where the A button on a 3DS XL is placed: It is right up against the edge. Having to try to press something that close to the edge while trying to still hold the unit is going to be very uncomfortable, and that's why a product that doesn't add much width is basically guaranteed to fail. But that's not all... it really doesn't add much length to the DS either. By length, I don't mean the underside of the DS, I mean the side with the select/home/start buttons. Without more length, I have to bend/scrunch my finders to hit the buttons because my fingers are too long. The only place this thing adds somewhat substantial dimensions is on the bottom (depth), but even then, without the width/length being increased, it almost feels pointless. I find my pinkie scrunches up on the bottom because deep part of the grips doesn't have enough length (ie - the deep part doesn't extend towards me enough), so by the time it gets to my pinkie there is nothing left for my pinkie to wrap around or grip on. Again, it's just uncomfortable.

They say a picture is worth 1000 words, so I'm going to leave you with some in this video review that really illustrate the problems here. I compare a picture of my hand trying to use the 3DS XL with the DreamGear grip on it, to a picture of how my hand looks holding Nintendo's new Wii U Gamepad controller (which is a much more ergonomically successful design). If you are reading the positive reviews and are on the fence about whether this is going to be comfortable, then just look at these pictures and see what you think. If this grip looks like it is going to be comfortable, get it. But if the position of my hand doesn't look comfortable, and you think your hand size is similar to mine, then steer clear!",0.0039773755901919726

The configuration software for this mouse, Razer Synapse, requires an internet connection. You must submit and verify your email address with the program to use it. Then, it sends information about you and your computer to Razer, and continues to run as an always-online data-mining surveillance application.

Razer mentions an offline mode on their website, but there is no such thing. It's a placebo to placate criticism of their activities. You can not register the software offline, and you can not use it without registering.

If you uninstall the software, features of the mouse stop working.

In my case, all I wanted to do was to turn off the LEDs and set one of the side buttons to be the middle-mouse button, but I can't do that without giving Razer my email address (for spam/marketing purposes), sending the unique serial number of the device, and associating that serial number to my IP email address, name, mailing address, a list of all software installed on my computer, and probably much much more.

Some time back in 2012, I remember reading news stories and Razer and their spyware. Then I forgot. Today when I got my new mouse, I remembered when I couldn't use it without giving my personal privacy and security.

Very interesting mixture of horror and science fiction.  No problem with that.  The problem is with the execution of the game in and of itself (I have an XBox 360, so those are the controls I used).

First there is the movement.  The movement is in no way fluid like, say, FEAR or even old-school Doom.  The movement is a bit dull.

Second, the mini-games, the asteroid action is the worst I've even gone through...I tried to get through this for two weeks, did not work.

There are some interesting innovations.  The zero-g is interesting.  The slowing down of time is also pretty neat way of dealing with enemies.  Too bad that there are sections that, because you can't get through them, you'll never know how the story will end.

You start off in the middle of town and must work your way through an obstacle course of killer bees and random objects thrown in your way.

Super Nintendo with Mario All stars & Super Mario world. Nintendo 64 the very finest TOP FLIGHT of the Nintendo platforms. So many consistently awesome titles. Mario kart 64, Super Mario 64, Doom 64, Quake 64,, and the Zelda titles. Top Flight bitches.

I will even give the Game Cube a nod over Xbox, or PS2. The Micro mini discs were too sweet. The best cube in the world.

To thank the millions of people who loved you and had similar stories of gaming glory. You reward us with......

The Nintendo Wii with motion plus controllers. I like the concept your hand is the controller. Here the problems one by one. 1. For the price they charged, would it of killed them for Bluetooth control? Leaving us with a constantly fluctuating signal even with the sensor bar aligned. Sometimes, not often it would work as intended. 2. No HDMI input. The PS3, and Xbox 360 both were out at the time of this technology, and a blind man could of has seen HDMI was the way of the future. A Nice bonus was this technology was included in both PS3 & Xbox360.
3. No playback of DVD, or Blue ray technology.
4. Bad features of a remote. The controller later released for retail @ $59.99, It should have been included for when the sensor alignment fails, and sooner, or later it always does.

For these reasons, and the many nearly unplayable games like The steering wheel for Mario kart Wii. Which in a later review I systematically take Mario Kart Wii apart and expose it for the trash it is, and why it nearly killed a franchise. That's for a later day. It's for the aforementioned reasons above that I could never give Wii U a chance it's still more of the same BS. Thanks for fixing a nearly unplayable platform, giving it a fresh coat of paint with the fixes. Tuh Duh! may I present Wii U, It's what Wii should have been in the first place.

593,1.0,"It's hard to believe this is a Bioware game.  Bioware used to be synonymous with high quality, in depth, incredibly fun games.  They have moved on from the PC to making only pretty, but shallow, console games.  This game is clearly a console port.  All of the depth and complexity that used to be Bioware trademarks are gone.  What remains is pretty, but unsatisfying.

The interface works poorly on a PC--implementing the bare minimum to match the controls available on a console.  For an RPG, there is very little customization available to the skills your characters can have. The game suffers from very long load-times between locations, and there is a surprising amount of sound problems.  The sound frequently stutters, skips, and drops out.  I wish I had bought this as one of the console versions, because at least then I could have returned it, and gotten a small amount of store credit for it.

The story, long a Bioware strong point, is nothing special.  It feels like a repeat of numerous plot cliches that we've seen used in previous games.  Bioware seems to have run out of new ideas.

They admitted to drawing upon Skyrim for inspiration in making this version more open-world.  If that is a desirable feature to you, stick with Skyrim, in this game, it just feels like filler to add length to a fairly short main story line.

I keep hoping that Bioware will return to it's roots as a quality game developer.  But for now, I'm giving up on them. I feel burned by the last few games I've bought from them, and this game is no exception.",0.02366100892696219

604,1.0,"Imagine a world where you can't die, and only your body can. You are a computerized entity capable of ""hacking"" into the minds of enemies, controlling them and turning battles in your favor by catching squads of your foes off guard. But, imagine that you can only do this once your host shoots an enemy enough times, is close enough to said enemy, and whose aiming abilities make Shadow the Hedgehog look like Master Chief. Such is the world of the painfully generic MindJack.

Story: D-

To illustrate how important plot is to this game, let me first tell you that MindJack allows players to interrupt your campaign at anytime by ""hacking in."" This means that your quasi-successful run of a level could, in theory, be ruined by some idiot who doesn't know his rear end from his elbow. Before you ask, YES, that is indicative of how urgent this game's ""story"" is. From what I gathered, it's about some super-amazing secret agent assigned to escort some woman who has some kind of special ability and a passing resemblance to a loved one, and he's supposed to do... something. Honestly, I stopped paying attention, because the voice acting and dialogue was so pathetic that I stared at the ceiling to keep myself from getting bored. Yes, my dull white ceiling was more engaging than this game's plot.

Gameplay: D

This game is a perfect example of how a brilliant concept can fail miserably if executed wrong. And trust me, it can't get much more wrong than this. The bland, last generation gameplay might be forgivable if FeelPlus had taken the game's main concept a little more seriously and turned it into a compelling element of battle. Instead, they turn it into a sluggish hassle that gives you little motivation to use it, which isn't good considered it's technically the only way to survive throughout the game. Other small things, such as your character walking at a snail's pace outside of battle, and the camera shifting down to the ground whenever you pick up a weapon, become nuisances which further mar what could've been such a great experience. And I refuse to comment on the slapped-on level system, simply because it seems to serve barely any purpose.

Graphics/Sound: They're Bad

Normally, I split the graphics and sound into two more sections and give them their respective grades. In this case, however, I'm willing to make an exception and just be honest: these are both the most laughable aspects of the game. Bland graphics with jagged edges galore are accompanied by the most generic soundtrack this side of a Saturday Night SyFy Original Movie. Problems are worsened to a further degree by the laughable cutscenes, which have some of the worst voice acting since Resident Evil in 1996. It's really sad that a game like this, with a pretty large company putting it out, can scrape by with such dreadful post-production values. Actually, it's not sad: it's embarrassing. Deeply, trulyembarrassing.

Overall: F+

A cool concept, I will admit. If this had been prepped a little more, we would've had a grade-A game on our hands. Instead, we get a rushed piece of junk that will be in the bargain bin faster than the sound of your controller dropping onto the ground as you fall asleep playing this game. And to answer your question, yes, this game made me fall asleep in the middle of a fire fight. So please. Don't let your post-school or after work gaming session turn into a nap. I strongly urge you to play something better, or even replaying a game that you know like the back of your hand. MindJack is a special kind of horrid; it's painfully familiar and dull, and with today's options in the gaming world, there's no reason to spend 60 bucks, or any amount of money, on something like this.

605,1.0,"The developers of this game obviously had no idea how to utilize the motion controls of the Wii.

I've played Tennis - actually enjoy the game quite a bit.  But there's no where around me that I can play on my own, and what fun is that anyways...  I enjoyed Wii Sports Tennis a lot, but realized the game wasn't built to recognize the more detailed tennis strokes, nor did it work with Wii Motion Plus.

So I grabbed TS4 (on rental, thank Goodness...)  The first thing I noticed was that you don't actually aim your shot left to right across the course by controlling how soon or late you swing - like in real tennis.  INSTEAD, you use the nunchuck and push the analog stick left or right, up or down to aim your shot.  Really?  Why??  Then, I learned that you had to use the A and B buttons for drop or lob shots...  Really??  Why on Earth would I press a button on a MOTION CONTROL game when all you have to do is swing the ""racquet"" in a different direction or twist your wrist a bit during the swing.  How hard is that??  Furthermore, TS4 wants you to hold the Wii controller by it's side - like a real raquet - with the buttons facing sideways.  I had no problem with this at all, until having to hit the aforementioned A and B buttons, which are suddenly no longer in easy reach since you're holding the controller the wrong way.  Lastly, the only three stroke motions that the game recognize (bottom to top, top to bottom, and flat across) were still unreliable.  In fact, the tutorial mode REFUSED to read my flat stroke - swinging the raquet flat across at shoulder level - no matter how deliberately I made the motion.  When did it work?  When I simply held the controller against my chess and ""wiggled it"" from right to left with my wrist.  ""Good job!"" it said...  Really?!?!?

In the end, I couldn't even complete the first challenge because I couldn't play REAL tennis - I had to use convoluted controls to play a game that is done with nothing but wrist and arm movements.

The Wii should be a PERFECT platform for a tennis game, yet to this day I haven't been able to find a game in which due dilligence was given to make it work.  All I can say is, Topspin 4 misses the mark by a long, long long shot.",0.037434630344524565

Played a few hours, enjoying it so far. Get to a mission where I have to collect a few ""glowing spots"". Getting 5 or so allowed me to unlock 2 powers.

If I only have to collect 100 of them for the entire game, and they are all over the place, it is still more boring-work than should be in any game...ever, but at least it is manageable.

Turns out I was wrong. You have to collect something like 1250 of them. Oh my ******* ***, I am never EVER going to spend that many hours doing nothing but boring obnoxious filler that incompetent designers added to their game in an effort to try and make it seem longer.

I almost returned the game right then, but I decided to try playing a little more.

I completed a few missions, none very fun (shoot some guys to take control of an area, run a race).

Then I got killed because I had to destroy a ""CID"". The game doesn't tell you what that is or where to find it. You have to pause your game and look it up online. Forcing me to quit playing to look up HOW to play is inexcusable. (BTW I never did find it).

Cons:
- No freedom. There is a track you have to follow, but you have to do missions and kill people along the way. Doesn't really make sense.
- No weapons. For a game with no freedom, like this one, you would think they would try to spice it up with some cool weapons or something. Nope. All you have is a machine gun and a regular gun.
- I don't get why your car turns into a motorcycle when your life is low.
- Controls are too complicated. While you are going really fast and trying to complete missions, you have to add more confusion switching your weapons. You would think only having two weapons, it would be easy to switch, but no.

633,1.0,"Absolutely horrible attempt at a cash in hoping to lure Elder Scrolls fan to purchase a game that failed on PC due to MANY varying development issues. Some bullet points you need to know before purchasing. Some of these will be very basic, but fundamental in knowing what you are getting into if you a casual gamer which follows brands, and not development, thinking this is the next Skyrim.

* This is not an open world. It is a gated level based world, meaning you will not b e able to just travel everywhere. You will only be moving in segments (Zones) similar to World of Warcraft.

* Megaserver technology is broken and has been since the PC version. It has never worked correctly. What this means is that under any time the server gets stressed, you will have NPC's vanishing, Broken Scripts on Quests, and worse, the main staple of the game which is to be PvP, anytime more than 20 players are on screen your particular viewpoint in Cyrodil will come to a screeching halt with unresponsive combat and ability lag. Meaning you will press combat buttons on your controller and they may fire 2-3 seconds later or not at all. You will also have major rubber banding issues - which leads to their bandaid fix they created 6 months ago on the PC version because they cannot fix it. Queues.

* Queue times will be outrageous. Not because the game has sold so much, which would be exciting news. But because their megaserver will crash when above and beyond a server threshold which is very minimal. They have, and still have, no idea how to fix it a year later after PC launch, and their only fix is to limit the amount of people that play at any given time before the server breaks. This only subsided on the PC version when everyone stopped playing the game and some folks started running true numbers.

* The game is not developed by Bethesda. It is developed by a company called Zenimax Online. President: Matt Firor, Creative Director Paul Sage. If you follow games, you know that these two designers have a very low opinion formed about them in the industry, and word has it Paul Sage has been fired as a result of poor management of this game.

* Voice acting is about on par as any other Elder Scrolls title even with professional actors. Although it wasn't phoned in, it sounds like it. The story itself is very drab (This is my subjective opinion) with very limited play types during the quests themselves. Instead of collection quests, you have a barrage of the ""Go here, activate this and this, return to quest NPC"". The storyline itself is stagnant.

* PvP was to be the saving grace of the game, but this severely was hampered because of a lack of resources dedicated to the PvP development team. The PvP can be extremely fun, when it works, but unfortunately it doesn't a strong majority of the time due to the megaserver technology and the broken concept/technical aspects.

If you are looking for a free to play game masked with an $60-$90 dollar price tag based on the version you get, you would be going in with high expectations. Sit this one out. The realization of this to be released on Console was ultimately done to recoup all the lost development costs from the PC version and poor management of a poorly led Zenimax Online.

One thing: Do not mistake this with Elder Scrolls from Bethesda. This was a spin off from another development company and had nothing to do with Bethesda itself, and both Zenimax Online and Bethesda (And Battlecry studios) have the parent of Zenimax Media. If anyone is to blame, it would be

1) Zenimax Media for whoring out the IP to developers with a long standing track record of horrible management.
2) Viral marketing which has paid streamers to promote the game and shout down the negativity, and have some reviews here doing the same.

If you are on the fence, wait for 2 weeks for the dust to settle. If you need to read the PC reviews which after a year runs even worse than today, check out the metacritics. Which are even high at a 5.7.",-0.013908469685281307

Call of Duty 4 - 10/10,
Call of Duty 5 - 8/10,
Far Cry 10/10.

651,1.0,"The greed of activision-blizzard, and the absense of most of the people who made D2 and its expansion a success are sorely apparent in the mess that is D3.

The game was launched in a semi-beta state, the servers used to play it (being online only) were also apparently poorly set up and planned, as many, many people had issues for a few days after launch (unable to connect, loosing connection often, obscene amounts of lag, ect). The item system (which basicly MADE D2 the legend that it is) is fubar, the item prices on the Auction House are hyper-inflated, due to hackers and item duplication already becoming a problem (funny that was the main, if not one of the main, reason's why blizzard didn't give us an offline / true single-player mode.. they claimed it was to make hacking/exploits harder to do)

The auction house is apparently what blizzard -really- built the game around, as they will make money off of every (real money) transaction that goes thru on it. The game itself is incredibly short and easy to max level on (i was level 60, the current level cap, within 3 days of semi-casually playing). Inferno difficulty, the supposed ""end game"" of D3, is hard and unbalanced to the point of being..well.. pointless.

Character customization and differant builds/playstyles? also gone. Everybody gets the same skils, at the same time, with the same potency. The only difference is what gear you are using, which will -ONLY- increase your skill's damage, or your vitality (hit points) or your resistence to various types of damage. So everybody will wind up basicly playing the same character class. EVERYbody. The 3 diff mercs you can hire once you find them? Also next to useless once you get into the later stages of the game, simply because they don't scale that well in relation to your own character, and the only thing you can do to improve them is their weapon, and 3 pieces of gear (amulet and 2 rings)

To summerize, the only improvement they've made over D2 is the music / sound effects, and to a lesser extent, the graphics. As it stands now, this very well could be the game that significantly wounded, if not outright killed, the diablo franchise. Had i known then (when i pre-ordered) what i know now, i would not have spent the $110 on the collectors edition, and im not sure i would have even shelled out the $60 for the regular edition.

Edit : adding this after the new patch (1.03) was rolled out today. Changing my rating down to 1 star each, because they have pretty much proven that they do not care what their rapidly-dwindling fan/customer base thinks or wants. This new patch has increased gold repair costs for your gear by roughly 4x, WHILE drasticly reducing or outright removing the effect magic/gold find has on chests, barrels and all the other in-game ""containers"" which can spawn loot. Now, it wears down your gear simply by destroying objects in the environment. What this means is essentailly they are putting an IN-GAME GOLD TAX on everything you do or are subjected too (fighting, breaking/opening containers/objects, dying) while reducing the amount of gold/magic items, or the chance to get them.",-0.009149625280247974

From time to time I'll have a go with one of my new games that supports the function and rediscover how much I hate the genre

I pre-ordered Brink on the basis of pre-release reviews concerning graphics quality and ""robust single player experiece"" - the reality is the first element is no better than many other games and the second is an outright lie.

The ""first person"" role is nothing more than an MMORPG format with the computer playing your teammates and the opposition. The developers did a GREAT job of modelling human behaviour, because both your teammates and the opposition act EXACTLY like humans online, that is, the run around shooting everyone and everything - and no, you can't direct them or give instructions like the Rainbow Six franchise. Oh, and your enemies, far from dying and allowing you to move forward to an objective like a real game, respawn ad infinitum. You, BTW, respawn too - unfortunately way back at the beginning, or right where you died, which is where the bad guys are, which generally results in you dying again immediately. Oh, and meeting your objectives, far from qualifying you to go through to the next level, permit you to change you sunglasses or swap out a jacket for a vest (not that there is any functional difference between these, its all for looks).

So, far from being any sort of single player combat game, the single role in this one is nothing more or less than a training role for multiplayer, and not a very good one at that. The only game that is even as close to as bad as this is for the true PC gamer is Red Orchestra.

Unfortunately, Game Party is the shovelware series that millions of Wii owners fell victim to in the first place, allowing it to leech onto our beloved console even more for clueless, innocent buyers to purchase for family-friendly fun only to fall to their knees in frustration from the near-brokenness of what they just purchased.

Game Party 2 continues the trainwreck-of-a-minigame-collection idea that Game Party gladly used to scam victims out of their wallets. There are eleven activities this time, but considering that around nine of those eleven share almost literally the same exact control scheme on paper (""Press A in this stance to prepare tossing the object, then go over to THIS OTHER stance and RELEASE A to toss the object!""), it's pretty much all just a bunch of filler.

Development on Game Party 2 was obviously as lazy as ever; as if the reused idea of throwing games wasn't enough, the motion controls are slightly improved, but are still just about nonfunctional at times, and while I'd like to say the graphics still look like as if they were from the Playstation 1-era, I think that would be insulting that gem of a console, as I've seen it do better in terms of graphic capabilities.

i have gone on to play a few more games after that, but have been pretty bored and frustrated with it.  i played a game today and won 10-6.  i should not be able to score 10 goals while playing 10-minute periods.  another annoying aspect of the gameplay is that the game seems to throw a fit when i score.  so, 90% of the time after i score a goal, the cpu scores a goal within 30 seconds.  it doesn't matter if their shot comes from the face-off circle, they'll make it.  i usually end up having football scores by the time i'm finished rather than hockey scores.

graphics- they're ok.  some of the faces look really good, in a cartoonish way.  let's face it, ea makes their sports characters look more cartoonish than realistic.  i have always preferred the graphics of the 2k series, in any game.  not only do the faces look cartoonish, but the bodies look compacted.  everyone seems really short and wide.  it's almost as if the makers of the game decided to make nobody taller than 4 feet on the ice.

665,1.0,"Sadly, I knew from the opening sequence that this game wasn't going to be very good.  I had high expectations that were not only not met but actually dashed to bits.  In a nutshell, this game stinks.

First is the environment.  Forget the lush visuals of the trailers and promos. at least 80% of the game will be spent in dark rooms, hallways, corridors, outer space, spacecraft, vent shafts and other drab environments.  Second, the navigation stinks.  The navigation and objective markers are very confusing at times. And that's only when the directional objective marker actually feels like appearing (there were several times I tried to invoke it, only to get a text display of my objective and nothing more).  It can be more confusing than helpful at times, especially when it rotates 360 degrees, like when you're in outer space, zero gravity or on a multi-level structure.  And some of the mission objectives are just downright confusing.  You'll get a vague hint like ""assist so and so"" but it doesn't tell you that this assistance involves several steps that aren't very intuitive.

The weapons for the most part are decent but there are major shortcomings.  For instance, the game loves to put you in rooms full of ammunition and weapons like you're in a candy store but you can only carry a ridiculously small supply. You get one primary weapon, one secondary and a max capacity refill of reach. There are two types of grenades but you can only carry one type at a time.  When you're looking at a weapon on the ground, you can see the specs for it but the lame comparison leaves a lot to be desired.  Instead of orange and green bars to indicate more or less power, just do a side by side.  The worst glitch with the weapons is that some of them will simply refuse stop working and refuse to fire.  There is no explanation, no little text message to say ""too close to target"" an indication that the weapon is empty or anything.  Nope, you just sit there pressing R2 like a maniac while getting riddled by the enemy.  As if ridiculous cheapness were';t enough, the AI enemies even do little victory dances over your body and take cell phone pics of their kill.  So after the game fails on you, it celebrates its failure in tacky fashion.

There are adrenaline packs that you can use during battle.  They will restore your health and also give you a temporary slowed down Matrix style ""bullet time"" boost.  It's helpful when facing a few enemies but pretty much useless when needed most, against scores of enemies as you'll encounter in the latter stages of the game.  Like the weapons, they also seem to disappear without warning when you need them most.  I'll start a new section with a full supply of adrenaline packs but somehow go down and see the message ""no adrenaline packs available"".

The tactical echo and O.W.L. were the only two things that really stood out about the game and even they had their faults.  They are usually excellent tools in your arsenal, especially for helping  deal with the darker environments.  The tactical echo acts almost like a heat sensor, displaying enemy silhouettes through walls, doors or floors.  The O.W.L. is your personal drone that is capable of providing a shield, attacking enemies, disabling enemy shields and hacking computer systems which accomplishes numerous objectives like disabling alarms, opening doors, navigating ships, disabling security systems, etc. Unfortunately, when you use the most useful features like shield and pulse, it quickly drains the O.W.L. and it will end up off in a corner recharging when you really need it.  Also, as far as engagement, although it occasionally kills enemies, (more in the beginning than latter stages), by the last few chapters of the game, it amounts to little more than a distraction and hacking device.  99% of the enemies will need to be dispatched by you.

All in all, I played the game only because I paid for it. I can wholeheartedly say if this were offered free as a PS-Plus game of the month or some other deal, I likely would have deleted it by now.  I would not buy the game again if given the chance all over again, but everyone has different tastes.  My advice is to watch a couple play through videos online just to get a grasp of the environment you'll actually be playing in versus the much prettier environments shown in the ads.  Might not hurt to rent it first as well, if you're able to do so.  Otherwise, grab it in a bargain bin as cheap as possible or wait to see if Sony offers it as a free PS plus game (highly likely in the near future) if you simply must have it.

However, if frequently getting lost in dark environments with malfunctioning weapons and vague directives while having enemies twerk over your body and take cell phone pics after a ridiculously cheap kill seems like fun, then dive on in.  This is the game for you!",-0.026974982039403492

667,1.0,"I normally don't read reviews on titles I played before, should have, now I've learned my lesson. I was not necessarily expecting this to be a free roam game but at least improve on and continue the fight for freedom, the fight against the EDF force/government.

Guerrilla inspired me like no other game had. Fighting an oppressive government, fighting for basic rights, there was no other game like this. I can only assume that the world government threatened the publishers to change the game style. They don't want the young generation to question their will, don't they?... they rather want games filled with propaganda and hatred towards other nationalities like Homefront, Call of Duty MW etc. Reminds me how Hitler brainwashed the German population into thinking that Jews were the cause for their misery.

Getting back to the game now. I was under the impression that I was playing below 720p yet my TV was showing 1080p. Wow! Graphics are really bad yet they advertise this runs at full 1080p. What a let down!
There are a few new cool weapons not present in Guerrilla, a good soundtrack and short loading times but that's it.

668,1.0,"This game is beautifully made with a lot of visuals and fatalities. The scenery is stunning and lush but the gameplay is just button mashing the entire time. 40 bucks to be given generic icelandic names and hack and slash hack and slash. This is time consuming for no just cause. The story is fair, but lacks diversity of enemies. The average is ""orc like"" creatures with bent backs and swords straight out of lord of the rings. Then there's these archers that always have good aim and a great rate of fire, but are never anything but annoying. Then as a more advanced race of creatures shieldsmen with swords. They are dark and armored thats about it. Then the champions are the most advanced they are button mashers too. The overall gameplay is a lot of enemies with only a few repeated moves to destroy them. There is only a few things good to say about it the visuals and seeing a hundred non controlled Vikings fighting. Yet, the mediocre thing about them is that they only have two looks bearded and unbearded. Their clothes are all identical. The quests are fun and easy until you have to go through a city to destroy a barracks and then it was 1 star after that. Too many enemies with limited damage ability. Like Assassin's Creed it is alot of graphic fancies, but zero substance. I resent ever paying money for something that doesn't even have checkpoints to destroy the barracks. Eight times and every time the result is the same red light and death. What happens? You are sent back to the stone that is your travelling portal. Your character that had killed countless enemies for them all to be for naught. This isn't a next gen game and it doesn't really feel like it was made after the year 2000 let alone it be made in 2007.

Called tech support at Rosewill; was told that USB appears to be failing and no fix except replacing keyboard. It finally totally died after about 18 months of use. Of course, it is out of warranty. I have been using personal computers for over 30 years, and I have never had a keyboard die. Even cheap keyboards that they give away with computers never die. I have typed on keyboards so long that the keys start falling off.  For nearly $100, I expected this keyboard to last for many years. My use of the keyboard was very ordinary, nothing at all extreme, did not even use it for gaming. Very disappointing for the cost.
INITIAL REVIEW: Cool keyboard.  I think mechanical keyboards are worth the extra cost; love the feel of typing on them.  I also like the LED-lit keyboard (blue on this one).  I also have a Corsair Vengeance (with red LED lighting).  Overall, I prefer the Corsair Vengeance because has  two dedicated buttons at the top to control the LED lighting, and a dedicated volume control at the top, and because the Corsair Vengeance has a metal case (more solid / substantial). This keyboard is heavier than your average keyboard, but not as heavy as one with a metal case. Apart from price, I would pick the Corsair Vengeance over the Rosewill Apollo; but both are great keyboards.  I can not imagine someone being displeased with either one. [BUT SEE UPDATE.] The Rosewill Apollo tends to sell for about $20 less than the Corsair Vengeance; so Rosewill wins on price.",-0.008332362082362087

Terrible graphics, worse gameplay and awful music. Don't be like me and assume that it must be good because Spidey is involved. I guess I should have researched it first coz it seriously is a bad, bad game.  It is sort of a cross between a side-scrolling beat-em-up and a run-and-gun game, but succeeds at neither.

It really just feels like any other generic platformer that was reskinned as a Marvel game halfway through development as very little of the gameplay feels unique to the characters. Why is Spidey jumping up ledges to climb buildings? Why is he not wall-crawling? There is some crawling, but it feels like an afterthought. The character sprites are small and puny with little weight to the animation or impact to the action, and the level design is haphazard, repetitive and generic.

683,1.0,"This game was a terrible let down. I purchased a copy for myself and my wife and we were both terribly disappointed.

It really does very little to connect itself with previous elder scrolls titles. The graphics are sub par even on an i7 & Nvidia 765 graphics card. The dialog is watered down after the introduction and voices from actors do not sync with lip movements.

You receive 1 gold regardless of the difficulty of mobs killed. Players camp quest npcs and shared loot is non existent. Guilds will horde exclusive mobs like werewolves or vampires that provide the diseases to turn in to them. Bots are rampant and the trade and general windows are filled with spam for in game currency.

Combat is clunky and feels like you are hitting enemies with a wet noodle. Animations are poorly implemented in both first & third person (third is worse!). Lots of travel required but mounts are ridiculously expensive. I don't mind this considering I have been playing wow since vanilla and mounts were just as expensive back then but the loot rate seriously hampers this and quests & crafting do not provide enough to realize the long term investments in obtaining a mount.

The game is also a pay to play subscription model and has been pushed back numerous times for a console release. I realize zenimax is not the same company that designed previous elder scrolls but has the bar really been lowered this much to where we are giving our hard earned money to companies who consistently cut corners when designing games and bank of the history and name of a well known title?

I feel sorry for anyone who does enjoy this crashy buggy mess that will eventually hit free to play. I played the beta and the game didn't feel any different from the beta than it did at release.

690,1.0,"I received the item with great enthusiasm due to the good reviews above. However, as I opened the box (not the one from Amazon, but the actual Thrustmaster box) I realized there were small plastic pieces laying around. I realized the wheel was poorly packaged and therefore there was a crack on the plastic with a hole above it. Not big deal really, yes it was broken but I wouldn't return it just for that. However after I installed the drivers I realized (on the windows test screen) that the brake pedal is completely dead. I did my best around re-installing drivers, looking for updates for drivers, nothing changed (of course it wouldn't, the drivers were just right the first time).

Then to top it off, 2 out of the 3 racing games that I tried the wheel on didn't work right away. In both Need for Speeds the wheel was working fine through the menus but not in the actual race. So while I'm sure I could've found a solution with some research, I decided to re-pack the wheel and send it for a exchange due to the defective pedal and broken steering wheel plastic.

I wanted this earpiece to be great, I got it with the intention of loving it, the only thing I don't like about the old school earpiece is that it's uncomfortable after a while. So I had no reason to prime myself with negative thinking towards this device. However, when it got here, it didn't waste any time making me a very unhappy customer. I have a lot, and I mean a LOT of bluetooth devices, everything from speakers, to conference speakers, to hands free speaker kits for the truck, headphones, ipods, all my computers, you name it, I've likely got it, I even have an older mp3 player watch around here somewhere with bluetooth... Anyways, the point is, I'm familiar with the system empirically and educationally, and my HTC HD7 had a hell of a time with this peripheral. My plantronics 925 pairs up to it in less than a minute once you have it in pairing mode, this piece took me a good 45 minutes, not because I didn't know what I was doing, but because there was something going on with the bluetooth mechanism in the earpiece.
Something that seems to have pissed off so many previous readers is that I said ""I hate windows phones"", and I do, the operating system sucks and the UI is outright retarded. Splitting hairs with me over whether or not the HD7 is a ""windows/microsoft product"" or not is completely pointless, as the point is, it is a ""windows phone"", and it didn't work well with the ""xbox earpiece"". Do I have to be a comedian and say it in a funny voice for the levity of that to not fly right over your heads?
Anyways, once paired, the piece performed horridly, I couldn't walk more than 3 feet from the phone, and I had to keep the side of my head upon which the piece was mounted facing the phone at all times, as apparently my thick skull was enough to interrupt the connection. However, it was still comfortable, and has a great battery life, so I figured if ""hell, if it works well on the xbox I'll still keep it"". But it didn't. My gen1 wireless piece sounded better, and operated at a functional capacity to a greater distance than this one. So I sent it back.

In all fairness, should I have gotten an exchange in case something was wrong with the piece I got? Maybe. But I didn't, I sent it back and said ""f it"", because this one was so bad I didn't really care to make another go at it. If they release another, improved one, I'll give it another shot, as the idea was great. But this piece deserves one star based on my experience with it, and that's what I gave it, I cannot with a good conscience suggest it to anyone.

You'd think the new singer career would fit right in, right? Wrong. A singer is an all alone profession. No duets (unless you get another Sim to sing karaoke with you)...no back up singers, no bands. Just your singer....out there on the stage.

If you singer Sim decides to switch careers to something else...then their singing days are over. Can't sing on any stage or even to their own kids. Other than the also boring karaoke...if you want them to sing....even as a hobby....you have to switch them back to that profession.

Expansion after expansion only adds a few new things to do...that are only fun for a short time. Your Sims basically have nothing else to do during their Sim day.

712,1.0,Everybody who has ever bought this game felt they were shorted. At least that is what I've heard and that was my experience.,0.0
713,1.0,"NPCs are a staple of any good RPG. You want to interact with them, talk to them, learn their story and accept their ridiculous quests because they reward you upon return. What you probably don't want to do, assuming they're a crucial part of the story or the only f'ing vendor that sells that one spell in the game is kill them in the face. While there might be some very marginal reward for doing so, like gold or a picture of their newly orphaned children, it's usually not as beneficial as say, letting them give you the dragon sword or slaying the mighty herpes beast. FROM Software has decided this is all crap, and if you happen to, I don't know, set the controller down to refill your scotch and accidentally hit the bumper button in front of the NPC there's a chance you'll upset them, defend yourself, and remove them from the game forever.

But it gets better.

While I managed to unintentionally kill someone that was apparently going to leave / die later anyways, it wasn't a huge deal. However, in the game there are a handful of NPCs you essentially rescue (or kill) from various situations. See, some of these NPCs are extremely important. As in, you'll never be able to cast vital spells or purchase story-based required items if you decide to hack open the barrel they're trapped in like a normal person when you're supposed to actually roll into it to break it (seriously).

I realize there are similar NPC vendors (two or three) throughout the game that sell similar items, but there are some very unique inventories and even if you couldn't get the super fireball from the first guy you slaughtered, the other guy you can buy it from is waiting patiently ... about 25 god damn hours from now in a place that's really hard to reach without the super fireball. Do you see the issue here? If you don't, I'll be happy to email you pictures of the first four controllers I broke with my face.

Range is Better Than Melee. Almost Always.
Some of you might remember games like Oblivion, or Morrowind (which I hated), where you could exploit the range attacks quite well. You know, go buy a few thousand ""Child's Crayon"" arrows and shoot them for two hours into the Lava Dragon Monster Demon Sandwich who wouldn't notice he was getting slowly pelted to death as long as you were more than seven feet from his face.

You can do the exact same thing in Dark Souls.

But that's exploitation, and doesn't mean the game sucks because people figured out they could take advantage of dumb AI and mechanics. Besides, those fireballs and arrows are only good for taking a shot or two at Bald Bull as he charges little Mac. Right?

Wrong.

Not only is the game incredibly cool about you eating through massive creature's health from range, but if they actually notice you, you're better off strafing and firing lightning bolts and stuff instead of ever pulling out a sword.

If you think that's an exaggeration, go ahead and look up every boss in the Dark Souls wiki - careful though, a lot of spoilers there. You'll notice 90% (again, seriously) of the ""Boss Strategies"" involve words like ""range"" and/or ""fireball"" and/or ""arrows"" and/or ""seriously, if you don't have spells or 200 dexterity and a crazy bow made out of baby skulls, you're going to die.""

That's kind of a problem if you have a PHD in snapping necks and a minor in Kinding of Shooting Arrows Barely 101 or the closest you come to casting spells is making fun of LARP videos on YouTube.

Just Go Get the Thing from the Guy and You'll Live Through This
FROM Software thinks that the more vague something is, the more adventure it provides in the search. For example, if you asked for directions to a landmark while hiking beautiful mountains with a loved one, this is a feasible philosophy. But it's nothing like that. It's more like falling out of an exploding airplane without knowing where to find a parachute.

There is actually a part in the game, seriously, where an NPC says something like, and I'm paraphrasing, ""you'll actually die if you go into (spoiler location) without knowing how to traverse it. There's this guy that knew how to traverse it. You should talk to him. Good luck, a-hole.""

Yep. And guess where this ""guy"" is? First of all, it's not a guy. It's an object, and second of all, it's in a location totally f'ing unrelated to anything you've done so far. You'd basically have to go exploring in an arbitrary location far away, fight a boss you may or may not be prepared for (and if you're not, clearly you're in the wrong place, right?) kill it, and get the required object.

I only figured it out because it was a fluke - a total accident. I was so pissed off at the boss I was stuck on I decided to go exploring and killing everything I could. I just kind of stumbled into this and got lucky. I can't imagine how angry I would have been had I found out the hard way.

But that's not all.

There are certain parts in the game that require other items - for example one item is absolutely essentially to even hit the monsters in the area while another is required or you'll stumble through pitch black. I know you're probably laughing and saying to yourself ""while you're brilliant and attractive, Homebrew, it seems like if it's dark you can just go buy a torch or use a Light spell."" Oh really? Who sells torches? Are you sure they exist in the game? Do I have to go attack a tornado and piss on a dragon's face to send him crashing into the roof of the pitch black area so it opens to sunlight? What if I am literally unable to cast spells? Who sells Light? DID I ALREADY F'ING KILL THAT GUY ON ACCIDENT?

I think you get the point. Pretend you're playing Castlevania 2, but remove any semblance of NPC instruction / dialog and make the things you're required to do slightly more obscure and less obvious.

It's not only vague, but you could have possibly ruined yourself and you just won't know it until 40+ hours in the game FROM Software gets your mom pregnant and sends death threats to your grandparents. At least that's what it feels like, considering the investment.

There's Some Grinding Involved
And I say ""some"" the way Keith Richards took ""some"" drugs. I don't care how exceptional your reflexes are. It doesn't matter that you won a Starcraft competition or ""intentionally"" wrote off dating women to win a Ferrari in a Doom tournament. And even if you play on a 90"" TV on your tenth play-through using the Nintendo Power Glove, you're still going to grind your balls off. The game is designed to be reasonable about reaching a boss, but once you get there on occasion you'll have a rude revelation: those monsters on the way to the boss were reasonably easy because you're going to have to kill about five thousand more of them in order to beat the boss.

The only saving grace here is that the game is insanely beautiful, combat is somewhat fun and the death animations are great, so at least you'll be mildly entertained until about Undead Zombie #47,103 dies to your counter-animation #23,558.

FFFFUUUUUUUUUUU

You'll notice that my writing went from structured and informative to sloppy and rant heavy. My sarcasm seemingly went off the charts, and you could probably feel the rage emanating from every other word. There's a reason for that.

That is exactly how this game feels.

At first you'll be in awe and wonder, reveling in the beauty and adventure the world provides. You'll notice a few issues here and there, but nothing soul-crushing (no pun intended). There will be moments of mild annoyance and irritation, and when you inadvertently slaughtered that guy you meant to greet you'll assume the consequences are limited.

Then things will get dirtier. You'll start forgetting where to go, stumble into places you're not sure you're supposed to be, wonder where to buy spells, items, and make stronger weapons. You'll start putting points into stats you're not sure are important, lose a monstrous amount of souls falling off cliffs, and trying to figure out what the hell a covenant actually means and how you gain reputation with one.

Eventually, all of your seemingly innocent ""mistakes"" will catch up to you, you'll be inundated with terms, items, and NPCs that make no sense whatsoever and provide little to no explanation. You'll start wandering aimlessly and failing at different locations you may or may not need to be exploring just for a change of fail scenery.

Then you'll be me. One broken controller, a $240 rug stained with Scotch, a bloody knuckle (not a joke), and neighbors that consider calling the cops every night around 8pm, when you're finally home from work, playing this god damn piece of crap game that you can't seem to stop torturing yourself with.",0.0014276905226870246

715,1.0,"This game had a lot of potential and I thought the concept was very neat. I also am a steampunk fan. Third-person shooters are a good time as well as I always liked Gears of War. The Order 1886 consisted of nothing but a huge letdown for me.

It seems like 75% of the game consists of boring cutscenes that you can't skip. It almost is like one of those lame movies your teachers made you watch that you had no way of getting out of watching. I am fine with some cutscenes if they actually are more than people yacking for 20 minutes and are fluid with the flow of the game. That's not the case at all here.

Aside from the cutscenes, there is some basic platforming thrown in. This will consist of about 15% of the rest of your time. The remaining 10% is actually action and shootouts. Not only is this obviously disappointing for a ""shooter"" game, but its also even worse because the shootouts are a pain in the neck. The camera angles suck. The game does have a decent cover system even if it is borrowed from other games like Gears of War. I don't mind that, but when every time I get hit while shooting I get thrown out into full stance and have to re-do my cover, what is the point? Isn't the point of cover when you get hit to be able to stay in cover and not start all over again?

I am just glad I rented the game. That and the graphics were the only good parts of the game.

While I was finishing up another game I found the game guide to this game and thought awesome I'll be ready to attack.  I've spent several hours playing Dark Souls now and I ready to say it sucks.

Having a game guide/watching youtube/ internet cheating is probably the only way you'll make headway.  I read the reviews thinking I'll gut the game out with grit and determination but that's not the case.  For instance after the training level you're plunged into a world with several possible paths.  All but one of these paths will lead you to certain and repeated death.  There is no hint or cause as to how to traverse these areas so a guide is necessary.  Leveling up seems to have little effect as enemies will get you in a state of stun lock if you challenge 2 or more usually.  Keep in mind you can fall from about anywhere and that means you will be starting from a save point generally far away.  If you don't recover your body you've probably lost a great deaL of hard work.

One of my biggest gripes if that you have no clue when sudden death is coming.  Thought you found a secret area.  You'd better hope that enemy you are about to attack doesn't have 3000x your hit points or its bye bye to the last 30 minutes work.

The game isn't challenging or fun. Its basically a trial in what you will put up with.  The camera is whack. The knowledge given to you within the game is lacking and the graphics aren't nearly as good as people say.

Unlike the Modern Warfare, where if you buy the disk, you can play multiplayer on all maps, this only has a portion of the maps required for online play.  Unless you pay the additional 25 bucks to obtain the downloaded content, you will be booted from match after match.

If that is not bad enough, about 20% to 50% of the games you are allowed to play are hacked so that the screen is spammed by text or certain players are invincible.  It turns out tht you spend 5 to 10 mintues waiting for a game that you have 50-50 ods of being kicked out of (because you didn't buy the map pack), and then have about 50-50 odds that someone will hack the game that you playing so that it is entirely no fun.

The campaign is short and unimaginative (aside from the zombies, but that gets old fast).  If this multiplayer was not hacked, it would be great the best of the COD series (except for the part where they scam another $25 bucks off of you forcing you to buy the additional map packs to play online)

737,1.0,"Functionality:

My Lachesis has never worked 100%. Even after installing the most up to date drivers and firmware, the pointer will still skip up to the top of the screen. It seems to happen a lot when im using my right mouse button to move my game camera around.

The programibility and macro functions of this mouse are on par with any other gaming mouse, so nothing special there.

Ergonomics:

This mouse takes a while to get use to, the way you grip it is different then a typical mouse. Its by no means superior to a normal shaped mouse, and so the steep learning curve (many days) is truely a negative.

The button placement on the right side are such that they are next to useless.

Ease of use:

Out of the box you must go online to update the firmware/drivers.

You must make sure your mouse pad remains clean from lint and hair as this affects this mouse more so then other mice.

Conclusion:

Look im not saying this mouse is a useless piece of junk. What I am saying is this mouse was a huge waste of money. At the time I purchased it, it was $80 and it has NEVER worked 100% I paid to get a top quality gaming mouse, and instead got a buggy product that isn't much better then any run of the mill $20 mouse.

*update* I have tried this mouse on windows xp, vista32, and win7 64. The pointer still will job to the top of the screen at random times.",0.014049832699718278

742,1.0,"Well kids, I just returned the Xbox One my wife bought me after only a week of ownership. With the One being my first gaming console since the original Xbox I was in for a big shock.

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

I don't know if it's me not catching up with the times but it seems like games and consoles have gotten way over priced and you can share games like we used to. On top of that we have to now pay a membership fee to even use the games we ALREADY BOUGHT. This all seems like one big marketing ploy to me.

745,1.0,"Just a friendly warning to all CDR/CDRW/DVDR/DVDRW drive owners.  UBI Soft as a ""feature"" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that's a valid anti-piracy measure, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in ""some"" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.
UBI Soft's tech support has said that this ""feature"" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  ""Flawed"" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.
I'm certain this game deserves more than 1 star, and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install, but I can't give it more than a single.  That's a commentary on UBI Soft and their ""feature"", not about the game itself.",0.017571599370481604
746,1.0,"I purchased  two of these Hori protectors from seller JADD ENTERTAINMENT with FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). This is the third out of four PS Vita Slim protector brands I have tried. This Hori failed me just like the brands Gam3Gear and Akwox. Only the brand Mr Shield did everything I wanted from any screen protector. Anyways, I read the comments and watched videos of how to apply this Hori screen protector so I came prepared. I used a strong electric air blower and a keyboard vacuum during the whole installation process. I wanted to make sure no dust was anywhere on the device screens. I even made sure to blow dry the underside that you are suppose to peel off, steps 2 and 3 backing sheets. So when it is slowly being peeled off it hopefully wouldn't drop any dust particles all over the screen when the protector starts to adhere onto the device. Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 process was a pain for the first PS Vita device I installed this on. There was a lot of particles that got caught when the two backing got peeled off, sigh. I had to use scotch tape onto the protector to lift it and remove the particles stuck under the actual screen protector. It was not a fun process. On the second device was the same but this time there was a rainbow effect on the underside of the screen protector. I completely forgot to take a photo as the whole process stressed me out. No matter how much I pressed the protector, the rainbow effect just wouldn't go away. I ended up applying a different protector (Mr Shield) on the second device that worked so much better and took less than 3 minutes to apply. I will be removing this Hori protector off the first device as I don't feel it will protect my screen at all. Waste of $30 for 2 of these terrible Hori film ""protectors"".

This protector is also not edge to edge size as I was hoping for. It is also one of the thinnest screen protector I have ever come across... so thin you wonder if it'll even protect anything. It's thinner than the protective backing that you peel off the protector during application. It also has an annoying straight line in the middle of the protector from the peel off backing. It comes in 2 separate backing film that you peel right then the left (steps 2 and 3). Step 1 is a tab you peel off the back and it's what you use to stick onto the screen while you align the protector. This step 1 was useless because as you start peeling off the backing, the whole protector starts to move around even when you are firmly pressing it down. The only positive things I can say about this protector is how invisible it looks once applied and how easy it was to get the bubbles out. The thinness of this item is what makes it look seamless and almost invisible. The question is, how much will it actually protect your screen? This is literally like the film you find on brand new electronic devices when you first buy them that protects it from fingerprints... even though this Hori still catches fingerprints like crazy.

For the price and only getting one thin film type ""protector"" per kit, I'd look elsewhere if you are serious about keeping your screen from any serious scratches.

ETA: I decided to play with my Vita before removing this Hori protector. I didn't like the feel of the protector at all, had a very semi-rough cheap film feeling to it. There was some missed touch screen responses that had me worried that it might of been my brand new Vita, but come to find out it wasn't soon as I did the Welcome Park app. The line that I mention in my original review was annoyingly visible during gameplays that had white/light colored backgrounds. It's hard to capture a close up picture of the imperfections unless you see them in person. Even after my hard work of almost 2 hours of applying this protector on two different Vitas, there was still so many imperfections underneath the protector. Removing the two film backing while it adheres to the screen is such a major flaw imo, so many dust will fall... just look closely and use a flashlight if you already own this protector. The screen looks better without this protector on. The feel, middle line and collected dust outweighs the esthetic of ""invisible"" look of this protector. Extremely disappointed with this product and have no idea why so many praised it.",-0.007167552795164924

753,1.0,"I went back into the game last night, cause I was bored and really wanted to see if I really hated it as much as I did. Well I do. Worse actually. I took a week off of work to do nothing but play Battlefront. Wife even bought a Black Christmas Tree and put Star Wars ornaments all over it, with white lights and stars. I'm not a Star Wars Superfan, but I was fourteen when Star Wars (original) came out. - So I REALLY was looking forward to this, and had played the beta.

Within the first 30 min after clicking the Launch Button at midnight, I thought I was going to be ill. The game-play is SERIOUSLY flawed and feels like it was created by two totally different teams. It's like they spent a year recreating the Star Wars universe, and then paid some low rent intern to code the actual gameplay over a weekend. By far the absolute worse combat experience you could have imagined. There's no logic to anything. Zero - It's just random chaotic deathmatch with objectives that have no value. It's much more important to pick up the random ""perks"" that spawn on the map than to play any objectives. Actually you can get a great score by just holding back and picking up the vehicle spawns only.

To say the GamePlay is written for children would be considered borderline ""Child Abuse"". How could it be possible to have such a beautiful looking and sounding game, (and it does look fantastic) with authentic Star Wars atmosphere, have game mechanics, balance, hit detection, and such skill-less gameplay, be so poorly implemented? The game play equates to being blindfolded, tossed into a small pit with thirty-nine other blindfolded people, and everyone given a chainsaw.  The whole time you're playing you keep thinking to yourself ""Surely this just cannot be this bad.""  But it is.  Then reality sets in.... "" I spent how much on this? ""

I literally, (I'm not kidding)..... I literally walked up behind a guy, shoved my blaster rifle into his back, opened up and completely overheated my rifle, only to have him turn, and one shot me. - I've been killed by a shotgun style gun, from a guy nearly on the other side of the map. - Any other game, they would be considered to be a possible hacker. But not in this. THIS IS THE ""GAME"". Random, death, from any and all directions with no meaning, or purpose.

No matter what play style you prefer; camping, attacking, ninja captures, etc... is meaningless. Shoot one time and fifteen other people will just open up on you from all directions.

I don't write many reviews at all, but this is disgusting and an insult to the Star Wars franchise. Now I have to look at this Star Wars themed Christmas tree for the next month that my wonderful wife made for me...... to remind me just how crappy this game is.

I put up with no standard auction house.  I put up with the poor UI and had to use 3 addons to give me an actual useful UI with onscreen buffs icons, mini map, clock, etc.  So I continued, until I discovered the ridiculous veteran rank so--called endgame. When you hit level 50, you aren't really given a choice, you now have a spell placed on you so that the opposing factions see you as friendly and you now get to turn traitor against the very faction you started out with and fight against them by doing the other two alliances (factions) 1-50 quests! That's right, the alliance you choose when you created your character, the alliance you've been fighting for and leveling with, and made best buddies, now at 50, no longer matters since now you have to go play the other alliances 1-50 questing and turn traitor to your original alliance you choose from the start. That's ridiculous!! If I wanted to play a character on the other alliances, I would have rolled an alt for those alliances. Talk about taking an arrow to the knee when you hit 50 and discover this is now what you'll be doing. There's nothing else for advancement besides this, so yeah, no thanks. This idiotic idea of an end-game killed the game for me. Why the hell would I fight against my own faction, just to experience the other factions quests? To put it into perspective using World of Warcraft as an example. It would be like joining the Horde, leveling doing mostly quests from 1-90 and then when reaching 90, being told you now will have a spell placed on you so the Alliance sees you as friendly, so you now can go do their 1-90 quests and kill Horde faction despite actually being a Horde in magical disguise. How freaking stupid is this! What's the point of picking a faction if you're just going to throw that out the window when you reach 50? This is how lazy and cheap Zenimax did end-game, by using already made content in the form of the other alliances 1-50 questing and forcing players to basically turn traitor and abandoned their chosen faction and go do the opposing factions leveling questing.  This game needed at least another 6-12 months of development, to iron out the bugs and actually produce a viable end-game that makes sense. No wonder they pushed back the console release by 6 months.

Issues with game:

In short: it feels like 8 bit movement but looks like a modern graphical game.
~ Control scheme is proprietary, Instead of using a well known method moving your character around in game.- targeting, fighting, crouching, cover, leaning etc.  of most FPS games like COD, GTAV, HALO, Even DUKE NUKEM did a better controller feel. - and others that have game mechanics that actually work. - It feels very awkward controlling your character. This leads to much over aiming and re-compensation making what should be an excellent FPS game fall short of the name it was bestowed with. Developers goal must have been to make the feel of moving your character around like using WASD without a mouse. I won't be finishing it, I find it overly frustrating though trying to navigate the games mangled controller interface.
Anyone who prefers the responsiveness of the old nickel arcades playing q-bert or tron will love this game. - Anyone who prefers more fluid controller dynamics like COD, GTAV, HALO- even Mario Bros for Nintendo felt better.

~ Graphics are ok. Personally I think they don't look as good as metro, but they are alright. I wasn't expecting much just hoping for a good fun FPS. I feel let down. At least the game doesn't crash or freeze. .

It is with this qualified gaming background that I can confidently say, this is the worst title ever released by Blizzard.  This feels like a low quality Activision game that has licensed Blizzard's intellectual property.  The content of the game can be finished in 7 hours but then, you get to replay it again for four times on different difficulty levels.  Awesome game design?  No, it's not very fun.

Monsters on Inferno mode (where you get level 60 gear) have many abilities to make your character uncontrollable, e.g. fear, jailing, knockback, pull-ins, and others, which are never fun alone, and downright stupid when they occur in combination together.  Some combinations make it so you just end up dying over and over no matter your level of gear just so you can beat certain mob packs.  Not having control of your character is just bad game design.  Then you end up with a huge repair bill.

Graphics are horrible.  It looks like a game that was made 7 years ago but got shelved.  Act 1 and Act 2 graphics look worse than WoW or SC2 graphics.  Act 3 and 4 were clearly made later, possibly even by a different developer team at Blizzard and is barely passable.

The real-money auction house just makes this game feel dirtier than it is already poor in quality.  I'm very disappointed with this release.

The problem is the main story line requires you to use the camera about half way through. No camera means game over, so I paid for half a game. Ubisoft's  tech support told me to start a new game with no guarantee of a repeat and that response about a long running issue like this completely deflated my desire to play.  It's a huge disappointment, I was enjoying the game until these game breaking bugs appeared and I'm not the only one, Google it. I was going to get the new Assassins Creed (also Ubisoft) but I've read that's buggy as well. I can't recommend FC4 to anyone because of the frustration of hitting a dead stop after so much invested.

797,1.0,"This game cheats so bad. Not as bad as their Android version of Monopoly, but almost as bad. On the Android version the difficulty level basically means how bad it will cheat on it's dice roll. After five games where I hit the income tax space 80% of the time I went around the board, but the CPU player hit that same spot maybe 5%... you might start wondering if the game is rigged. It's not limited to income tax either. You will land on all it's properties while it dances right by all yours without hitting anything.

On this Xbox version it rolls doubles on almost every single one of it's turns. And then rolls a second set of doubles on about half it's turns. It will also keep you landing on ""just visiting"", Chance, and Community Chest and other spaces such as those making it impossible to buy any property as it scoops everything up quickly due to it landing on normal properties and getting multiple rolls since it rolls doubles on every turn as mentioned.

EA has a history of substituting game intelligence for rigged dice to balance out gameplay. This leads to much cheaper developer costs, since instead of having to program a real game engine, they can just hard wire the dice to control how things play out. EA also has some of the most over the top copyright protection schemes of any software publisher on earth. Just check out the reviews of the PC version of Spore to see a sample of what I'm talking about.

I wish Parker Brothers wouldn't have farmed out all the Monopoly games to EA, since the concepts of these games were great, but EA butchered the execution. Without the cheating, rigged dice, and other frustrations this would be a 5 star game (so would the Android version), but instead of being fun it just will make you angry and stressed out.",-0.04268670251126392

Now I'd like to call my-self a Total War fan, however I've only played Rome: Total War and Medevial II: Total War and I was verry impressed. and so with that in-mind I decided to buy Empire: Total War...after four hours dealing with the picky Steam player I was finally under-way to install the actuall game. which yes I must admitt that the flaming hoops I had to jump through just to get Steam on my system was a HUGE turn-off but it had nothing to do with the Games review that I'm about to get to. if you want to hear what I think of this 'Revolutionary' Steam product scroll down this review to the bottom page.

After dealing with that I hit the play button... and then I had to wait for Steams ""Updates"" wich took forever.

after that! I was finally under-way playing Empire: Total War. The battle map is a little bit better looking than Medeivel 2 TW(Total War) but will make your computer (if it is an older model, or clutterd) run slower than cold malasis going up-hill. but eventually I was under-way in a land battle, visually satisfactory, nothing really remarkable about it. However the AI in this game is terribly stupid, I play as the general I'll win the battle and get a 'Heroic Victory' I let the AI take over and I loose, even if I have a huge competant army.

the Total War Empire has hit a HUGE bump in the road with Empire: Total War. can it come back? absolutly and I sure hope they do, maybe with a Rome II: Total War the best of the games I've played so far. and another downer with Empire: Total War is there is no EmpireTotalWarShell so you connot bulster your cities that way or gain money that way, you have to grit and bare this difficult game out the old fashion way. which there's not proberlem with that, it's the most relistic way. but I do miss being the richest and most advanced faction in the Empire...

And this game bring the use of 'technology' and takes away all the more control you used to have over an TW empire. you get your special people (Preist, gentlement(technologist) and Rakes (assisnis)) when the game decides you can have one, which will lead to endless revolts and possible the toppelling of your nation. the Technology is gained by your gentlement that have to have an college to even get started, the technology is gain by turn and will take you the entire length of the game to succesfully complete.

Towards the Sea!
The game has much hype surround by it's fact that you now can control your ships on the battle-field. the ships are gorgeous looking, but the actuall gameplay of naval battle is cumbersome and will take ages to win, exspecially when you try to finish off your routing ememies ship... as you chase their ship accros the atlantic...

Steam The Worst Thing To Hit The Gaming Industry...
Steam is well I believe a anti-piracy system that personalizes the game you bought to you with a username password system that tailors that game to you and to you alone. so no more lending a game to you freind (which is a form of Piracy). and it suger coats the bad medicine you'll have to swallow with Steam by the intriquing idea of you can play that game from any computer. so like if your computer crashes and erases everything from you computer you won't have a hassel trying to install that game back into your computer. however the Steam system is a free download or it can be inloaded by the game that has to have it. and yes in order to play Empire: Total War you HAVE to have Stem in your computer or you can forget about it. however Steam is NOT easy to work with, so exspect a hassel trying to install Steam into your computer.
Steam is a good idea with a bad uneasy to use system. however somthing dose have to be done to curb the rising piracy attackts on industries just like Total War. Total War proberly lost hundres of thousand, if not millions, to piracy in proberly one installment of Total War, let alone the other games of Total War. like I said Steam has a good cause but not easy to work with...

813,1.0,"I'm a single player mode only gamer. I bought this game through Amazon based on trailers I'd seen and a couple of game mag reviews. BUT unlike every other RETAIL purchased game I have that requires a Steam registration to play (as stated on the DVD wrapper), the Homefront publisher goes far beyond this - and no advisement or other statement - where the game installs directly to Steam's game file storage - NOT ON YOUR HD. The only files installed on your computer are the game's Steam related access and security/permissions files. If you use a magnifying glass you'll find buried in the fine print and half obliterated by the DVD wrapper graphics in the lower right corner the statement you are purchasing a subscription to play the game. As such you can't access the .cfg files to halt the intro graphics or other common game .cfg file changes. Point being if you lose your Internet connection you will not be able to play in single player mode even if you have previously selected ""Offline"" mode with Steam because Steam checks to make sure you still want to play offline.

As if this wasn't bad enough, while the game installation was a relatively short under 20 minutes at my 2.6 MBps download speed, when it completed it then automatically began downloading the patch files - 99% for multiplayer - which I didn't want or need. I was never presented an option not to download the updates. So there I sat for an additional nearly 40 minutes for the update download - over twice as long as the game install took.

Once I got to the game itself, I found discrepencies with the stated console ported PC controls - such as the #4 key that is used to target enemy vehicles or other targets for attack - is not listed in the game manual. I eventually found the #4 key by mashing every key in succession. Once I got to where you fly the attack helicopter the stated ascend and descend manual default listed keys didn't work nor when I remapped the keys. Through dumb luck I found out the game was detecting my CH USB joystick elevator control. As such I had to unplug my joystick to gain keyboard key ascend and descent funtion.

Last, the game uses auto save points and even on the lowest difficulty setting all but the those with the fastest twitch reflexes will be repeating the same sequences time and again because of getting taken out by grenades that some how find you taking cover behind a shed or building with no enemy in sight. Bottom line, forget about using stategy or planning your moves or you'll die regularly. The best thing I found is to keep moving and hiding and moving and hiding and moving and hiding to get as close to the next checkpoint position .... and this isn't a sure thing either.

Bottom line, if you're a single mode player and don't mind having a retail purchased game really being a paid subscription to access the installed game files on Steams website, limited installs, screwed up and non-identified console to PC keyboard game controls, auto-save points and a high game play frustration tolerance, then Homefront is for you.",-0.005258607681585858

I'm a huge fan of Action/Adventure games, and have been playing them since around 1989.  The controls for PS2 Quantum of Solice are difficult and clunky. The HUD display map is really lame, almost useless.  Aiming your weapon is an aggravating chore.  Graphics are mediocre at best.

831,1.0,"Purchased this game a while back but just now got a chance to try and load/play.  I'd like to say I've played the game and it is wonderful; but the reality is that I'm still waiting 24 hours later for Steam to ""allow"" me to play the game (Steam now says the game will be ready to start in 3 hrs 45 minutes).  It may be that the game is great; but it's not likely that I'll find out anytime soon; as my computer is still exchanging data with Steam and the game can't be played until that is all complete.  Tying any game to Steam activation is a tragedy; and only serves to ruin the gaming experience for good-faith purchasers.  If you have a very fast internet connection the installation and startup experience may not be quite as painful; but honestly I cannot recommend any game that requires Steam activation (or it's EA competitor Origin activation).  You are at the mercy of Steam, it's snail-like servers and whatever their load happens to be at any particular time, and your internet connection.  If you are purchasing this game thinking you can play anytime you want, think again, you'll likely be sadly disappointed.

Well, after the better part of 4 nights trying to get this POS to work on Steam I am giving up and tossing it into the trash; too late to get my money back from Amazon.  Do not waste your money on this game; the hassle of dealing with Steam is simply not worth any pleasure you might get from the game.

835,1.0,"This is probably one of the worst games I've ever played for $60. As a standalone multiplayer game, it's worth maybe $15-$20 as an Xbox Arcade digital download. Though, it's not exactly $60 in my case. It was $249 because I bought the collector's edition. Suffice it to say that the CE-included humongous lighted statue and book combination are both far and away more impressive (and well worth the money) than the actual game. Let's begin with what's wrong.

Repetitive

Okay, okay. What game isn't repetitive? But, literally level after level after level is the same thing over and over and over. Other than the map changing, you're literally doing the same thing on each new level. There's no questing, no level ups, no strategy, no cover, no secrets, nothing to find.. I mean there is nothing. You're running around on a multiplayer map trying to avoid being constantly shot dead by the IMC (other live players). Titanfall is merely a death match wrapped around a weak semblence of a 'campaign' story.

So, the gist is that you either play as the Soldiers (blue) or IMC (red). The sole point is to win the level or be defeated. After one of the two outcomes, you get to the evacuation ship or you don't. You get points for being evacuated or you don't. The only and sole point is to run around killing anything you can find that is not someone on your team... and avoid being killed.

HUD

The HUD on this game just plain sucks. Unless you're close enough to actually be killed by another player, you can't tell if the player running around in the field is an enemy or a friendly. By the time you can get close enough to find out, your character is already being shot dead.

Controls

The movement is way way overly sensitive. Even on the least sensitive, you can literally spin in place with barely a tiny press of the stick. It's way way too sensitive even on the least sensitive threshold. So unrealistic.

Titans

About 2 minutes into each level, you can call for a Titan and it will fall from the sky. You can enter it and start your battle with your mech for as long as it survives (which is usually not longer than about 1-2 minutes). You then have to wait for another one to become ready (randomly between 60 seconds and never).

By the time you get your titan, all of the other players on the level are now in their titans. So, the playing field is leveled, kind of. Meaning, you can't exactly run around squashing other players by stomping on them. So, the point in being in a titan is really pointless by the time you actually get it.

Oh, and the animation to get into the Titan takes AGES to finish. It's like watching paint dry each time you enter a Titan.

Yes, the Titan armor is a clever gimmick. When playing the Titan portion of tutorial, I got the impression that you'd actually be able to use all of the clever things included. Like, jumping out of your Titan, opening doors and then calling your Titan through the doorway to get back into it. Nope. No need for that feature. At least, not in the first 5 level ups. I'm guessing if that's to become useful, it must be in a much later level. I have no intention in waiting through this poor excuse for an expensive game to get to a level where I can actually find out. I really don't have that much interest. If this game is actually about Titans, then let us use them more than not. There are far too many multiplayer ground combat simulators already. We don't need another. If you're going to offer us the use of a Titan mech, then offer the use of it to us all of the time.

Fun? No way

Every level starts and ends the same. The only thing different is the map. Everyone gets their titan at the same time. No fun to be had in that. Basically, every level ends up a free for all death match scenario with a really weak story premise behind it just to get the level going.

Worse, you can be playing the first level of the so-called 'Campaign' mode, but the game selects people who are level 42 and pairs them with people who are level 2. There's no fun in that either. If you're going to design a game where levels are important, then you should pair up people are within no more than 3-4 levels higher or lower than one another. Sorry, but this is single the biggest fail of Titanfail. When you design a multiplayer based game, you don't pair up players who are orders of magnitudes levels higher. That just doesn't work.

Definitely not enough Titan mech time. These things are far too fragile and explode when someone sneezes.

Overall

This game offers absolutely no single player campaign play. This is strictly a multiplayer game. Worse, this game is a weak multiplayer game wrapped in a pseudo-campaign mode that offers just enough of a premise to set itself up as a death match multiplayer game. Worse, there's nothing to do other than running around shooting everyone and everything in sight. There's no strategy, no questing, no dossiers, no audio files, no nothing to pick up around the level. Yes, it is eye candy, but that's it. If you really like just doing nothing but mindless death match and leveling up, there's nothing to see here.

So far on the Xbone, there has been no bigger fail than Titanfail... unless you count Ryse.",-0.0011424314119185207

POOR POOR BLIZARD",-0.002311977104597242
840,1.0,"Sonic the Hedgehog on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 has gotten arguably the worst rep. of any Sonic game out there, but there's one game I can easily recall that deserves as much negativity. That game is THIS monstrosity. I was at least able to find Sonic 06 to be a guilty pleasure of some sort, but THIS game is just BAD! There's a lot of questions raised that shouldn't even be here in the first place! Why does Shadow have to have weapons? Why do the characters curse all of a sudden? To make the game ""edgy""? Give me a break! Arguably the worst offender in this is: Why do there have to be branching paths?

Truth be told, I bought Shadow the Hedgehog (via FeaturePoints for Amazon gift cards....Didn't exactly use real money) just to play through its ""neutral"" pathway in the game, which only requires me to get to the end of each level, and nothing more. There was a bit of fun to be had (In fact, the gunplay isn't too shabby), but that fun was bombarded with tons of unnecessary things!

The level design is bad. In the first level, Westopolis, don't be surprised if you run straight into several inexplicable explosions while just trying to get a move on. Other levels don't exactly have as much frustrations, but there are still general problems like not being able to get a good view of where to jump at certain points, and control that feels slipperier than in Sonic Heroes. Instances such as the Shadow clones to fight in one of the later levels, though, get very tedious. Playing through the game would really suck if you do not grab a gun to shoot with, because Shadow's Homing Attacks don't deal damage nearly as quick, and you can FORGET about his punch/kick attacks!

If you thought the voice actors in Sonic Heroes were too cringing for you, then you're going to be absolutely ANNOYED with the new 4Kids/Sonic X voice cast's work done here! At nearly every turn in a level, a character Shadow meets earlier in the level feels the need to say something! And if you're not doing what he/she says you should do, the character will just complain or scold at you for not doing so. Leave me alone, NPCs! Either way, the voices here are AWFUL (With the lone exceptions being Sonic and Dr. Eggman)! Yes, I even disliked Shadow's new voice actor. He didn't even sound much like Shadow in the game!
You'd think at least the music would be good right? Welll.......not really. Shadow the Hedgehog's soundtrack is mostly crappy, with few exceptions.

If all of that wasn't bad enough, you apparently are not supposed to be happy with the ending you get after playing through the handful of levels you've chosen to play through. YEP! In one playthrough, you just have to play six levels, but for the sake of replayability, doing a Hero or Evil mission will lead you to different levels entirely, but each and every mission in this game (With exceptions being to just make it to the end of a level) is a boring, dull, painful chore. Most of them consist of nabbing excessive amounts of objects. I'll leave it at that.
Oh, did I say ""for the sake of replayability""? Oh I'm sorry. What I meant to say was ""for the sake of UNLOCKING THE FINAL STORY SEGMENT"". Yeah....Like Sonic Adventures and Heroes, there's a Final Story segment. They really shouldn't have done that for this kind of game! It completely throws the whole premise out the window!

Ugh.....I believe I've gone long enough here. Just stay away from this title if you're looking for an even decent Sonic title. Whether it be the Adventure titles, Heroes, or even recent ones like Sonic Colors, Generations, or Unleashed, they're ALL better than this game. Steer clear.",-0.02503319967724871

Have been my whole life  ( I'm 24)  So I am a experienced gamer and  VERY VERY good at most sports games( Madden, NBA 2k9,  ETC ) Mike Tyson has been my hero since I was about 2 and so ofcourse I was pumped up at the prospects of playing this game and destroying people on XBOX live .

This game is a bleeping JOKE !!!!  The graphics look good but certainly not mindblowing as some would lead you to believe!

The Controls are by far the WORST I have EVER had to deal with in a game.  To throw punches you need to use the right analog stick which wouldn't be a big deal most of the time except THE CONTROLS really DON'T WORK!!  To throw any type of Hard punches you need to the ""haymaker"" modifier button which is RB.  Theres literally a half a second to a second Delay on EVERY hard punch you try to throw.

You can literally go out and land 300 Flush Strait right hands on someones chin with Mike Tyson and nothing will happen. For me using the Haymaker controls were nearly impossible especially if you actually wanna try to block.

ALSO in typical EA sports fashion this game is a total Glitch fest already and it hasn't even been out for 3 months !!!!

There was many a times I would get Knocked out in the first round and on the replay the ""PUNCH"" that hit me really didn't even hit me!!!

The issue is that not every app functions correctly with this remote and you can't even adjust the volume on your TV.  Who ever was in charged in developing this remote should really be fired, or at least understand that they are very bad at what they do because the functionality of this remote is unacceptable in every way.

869,1.0,"The title says it all... this game is horribly slow.  The Wii cursor crawls across the screen, you can't skip most of the dialogue, and the game runs at a snail's pace.  Speaking of the dialogue, everything the host says is unnaturally spoken and choppy.  They spliced it together terribly, making it seem like a broken translator.  The questions are terrible, and often the game won't recognize what you input or change it to something completely different, even if your answer is up there.  The graphics are atrocious.  Everything is hideously ugly.  It uses your Miis, but only the faces, the rest of the animation is choppy and poorly implemented.  Your Mii characters look like broken puppets on the screen.  The game gives you a few options for backdrops and show themes, but after choosing them it never shows up.  You can unlock some videos from the actual Family Feud show, which is nice if you are a fan of recent incarnations of The Feud, but it's a small and useless extra in a game that just plain stinks.  The original NINTENDO version back in the 80s was better than this trash.

871,1.0,"After reading all the great reviews, I was very much looking forward to this game.  However, after playing it around 6 to 7 hours, I am left with much disappointment.  If you want a great first person shooter for your PS3, go with Modern Warfare 2 or Resistance 2.  If you want a game that looks good but plays terrible, Killzone 2 is your game.  Overall, I really regret buying Killzone 2 and can't see how this game got all the good reviews.  I am guessing it is because it is a Playstation exclusive.

Pros:
-Graphics are pretty good (though not any more impressive than Resistance 2 or Modern Warfare 2)
-Lots of effort has been put in cinematics

Cons:
-Control feel is terrible.  The reaction of your characters movement lags, aiming is slow and imprecise.  It feels like my character is trying to walk on ice without slipping.
-Lots of 2-3 second pauses throughout the game ruin the feel of the game.
-Game feels like it is running in slow motion.  I haven't checked the frames per second but I wouldn't be surprised if the frames per second drop to under 20.
-Your guy is very short, but isn't.  During all the cutscenes, it is obvious you are as tall as anyone else, but when playing the game, you are literally two feet shorter than everyone else.
-Characters are a joke.  Main character has no personality.  Everyone else is a caricature.",-0.03900223157189102

877,1.0,"Seems like this game was deliberately programmed to infuriate me. It's one of those games where you get your butt kicked while you're learning, a sensation I've never treasured. How would you like if I sat you down to a board game you didn't know -- you ask, ""How is it played?"" and I respond, ""Uh, you'll more or less get the idea once I start attacking you!"" That's exactly how this game works. I hate losing while I'm learning.

Anyhow, here's some other things:

1. The way this game was marketed promised a lot of good ol' hack-and-slash action. Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc. Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these! I solve enough g.d. conundrums every day at work: I don't need a video game testing my intelligence. I want to be a guy with huge muscles who runs around slaying monsters with his awesome sword! Is that too much to ask!?

2. The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time. Nearly every encounter is based on the ""cage match"" paradigm: your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue. Yawn.

3. You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type. This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way. This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at. Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements. As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see (e.g., the ledges he's jumping from and to), but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art.

4. The ""easy mode"" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges (i.e, the spike room, flying through the tunnels), they still manage to infuriate everybody.

5. The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game. (I frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done).  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.

6. This game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is (e.g., remember jumping behind Athena's bed?). Most of the time this is because the lighting source (and therefore the shadows) are illogical, so it's difficult to gauge distance and height. Consequently, success in the game's many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill. Also, the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle: sometimes, you can leap vast chasms; other times, you can barely hop over a puddle.

7. I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again. Why doesn't this game let you skip them?

8. The storyline is preposterous. The Olympians are immortal! How can they be killed? And how can you kill people who are already in Hades? And does it make sense that Kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of Olympus when he even can't jump over an effin' puddle!? The gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug!

9. The weapons you get have some grandiose names (e.g., ""Bow of Apollo,"" ""Claws of Hades""), but they're quite ineffectual, even against garden-variety zombies. If you're fighting a run-of-the-mill skeleton and it takes like 50 hits to kill him, it's time for a new weapon. (I love how the much-vaunted ""Bow of Apollo"" has about as much oomph as a spitwad.)

10. Curse you, Yu Suzuki, or whoever invented QTEs (Quick Time Events). I hate them. (These are the times when it's basically a cut scene but you have to press the X button or the O button at the right time.) What is this, the fourth grade? Are we learning to identify shapes this week? Another problem with these is that you can't focus on the cool graphics at all, since you're waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes. QTEs need to be outlawed!

11. This game is far too violent for my taste!  It just got to the point where you didn't want to enter QTEs when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross. If this had been a movie, it probably would have received an X for violence.  I mean, you're graphically pulling folk's heads off and stuff  Couldn't they have at least included a ""BLOOD OFF"" option, like they did in Assassin's Creed II?

12.  Game is not kind to you if you haven't played the first two installments.  You'll be baffled as to what's going on until at least halfway through the game.",-0.024896418767859835

884,1.0,"Infernal was selling for so cheap that I figured I'd give it a shot.  This was probably a bad idea.  While the game might have had potential, it ultimately comes across as broken, repetitive and generic.

It's a 3rd-person shooter in which heaven and hell, which are represented as corporation type establishments, are fighting each other.  You end up fighting for hell, and in return get some cool powers such as teleportation and shooting demon-fire energy out of your guns.

The graphics and sound are actually pretty decent, and the game might impress someone watching you play......but if you're the one playing, you know that what you're doing in the game is actually no fun at all.  A few gameplay scenarios were somewhat creative, such as the boss fights and puzzles, but 95% of the game you'll be running around shooting generic enemies.  With little use for the cover mechanic, awkward controls, and no real strategy needed other than run in guns blazing, the game just gets repetitive.  I also had it freeze on me about 5-6 times, and once I even saved my game in an area that glitched and would not let me pass, so I had to revert to a previous save in order to get through.  Very annoying.

Infernal went on for far too long.  I was hoping it would end relatively quickly....but it seemed to just keep on going!  I don't recommend Infernal, unless you like playing bad games (which, obviously, I sometimes do).  One star.",-0.07863559159222097

887,1.0,"Really upset with this purchase.  Huge cost on headphones and I expected the quality to match up, especially because I had Astro A40s before these and was really pleased with those.  I've had these for less than a year and I've had so many problems that I'm already giving up and buying a pair of Sennheisers.

First thing I noticed was the microphone quality.  The entire first week I had these my friends kept making fun of me for sounding like I was ""underwater"" and other jokes because of how bad the quality was.  I didn't believe them at first until I recorded and listened to myself - it was 100% true.  No amount of troubleshooting or firmware was able to solve the problem.

The second issue came up a little more recently - the bluetooth on these is terrible.  I am constantly dropping sound in the games I play, and as someone who plays a lot of video games that rely on sound (or coms from friends/teammates) this is the biggest reason I am upset with this purchase.  These A50s often lose connection entirely to the base station and I won't hear anything, or it will come in like static for several seconds.

NOW... do that over and over and over and over... until the whole experience is ruined by spending more time waiting for the game to reload than most people spend watching tv commercials during their favorite shows.

Sure the game is fun for a while.  It's nice to play around and see just how many things you can tether together and wreak havoc along with tons of laughs....  But let's be serious here.  that kind of dwindles down after the first couple of hours.  Whoever designed this game didn't really put a whole lot of effort into making it reasonably diversive.  Every chair looks the same, every ball, every table... and to top it off, in a game world of thousands of people, perhaps it would be a good idea to make more than just a dozen people and clone them over and over again.  It's only funny the first couple of times to watch some lady in a dress riding a motor cycle.  I actually stood on a roof top and there were four people there... ALL the same person.

The story line doesn't make any sense.  What I mean by that is that you can go around and free every village on the game and then go back and do the story line where apparently nobody has been freed yet.  There is just no order to this.

The tether and wing-suit is the only thing I like about this game.  It's the one thing that GTA5 is missing and if GTA5 had it, I would never come back to this game again.  To be honest, I'm really not sure if I will anyway.  24 to 48 hours larter... and the game is just boring and redundant.  And where is the realism here?  I get shot once by a sniper and die...  but I get nuked 18 times before falling off a cliff and the 15 foot drop kills me.  WUT?

903,1.0,"I generally do not give anything one star, but I really feel that the deception surrounding the release of this game needs to be exposed.
1.  I am a HUGE Borderlands fan.  Loved 1 and 2.
2. Unlike some other reviewers, I also really like this one. (yes, I know this is contradictory, but stay with me).
3. I have a PS4 and hadn't purchased any new PS3 games since I purchased the PS4 (right when it came out).  Until this game came out.
4. I was completely perplexed when I saw the announcement that this title was going to come out ONLY on PS3 and XBOX360 (look it up, all the articles are still there).  I would say I was probably on the brink of being pi**ed.  I vowed to not purchase it, just for that reason.
5. I purchased it anyway and played it for a while despite the fact that I usually only use my PS4.  I finally gave up on it because it was too much of a hassle to fire up my PS3.
Up to this point, no issues.  I decided on my own to buy the game even though I was mad that they were not putting it on the PS4.
6.  THEY ARE PUTTING OUT A PS4 VERSION NOW.
If they want to change their minds, fine, but they have to recognize the fact that less than 6 months ago, I purchased this game for the PS3 after being told it would not come out on the PS4.  Honest mistake?  I think not.  They knew they would only sell PS4 versions to people who already had a PS4, but ""how can we sell the PS3 version AND the PS4 version to the same person, even if they already have a PS4????""  Like this!
So how can they fix this?  Give us a credit.  Not ""just trade it in"".  Right now this game for the PS3 will get me all of $7 and some odd cents for a trade in.  Let us return our fully working copies of the PS3 version to the manufacturer and get a credit (I would say at least $20 would be fair, but it should be more).
UPDATE:  I just posted this review a few minutes ago and then went back to the product page only to find out that I can now get $16.91 for a trade-in.  I have no idea why it went from under $8 yesterday to almost $17, but I am going to trade it in now.  BUT that still doesn't excuse the developers since this is Amazon that is giving me the trade in credit.

The only good thing is that the saved games I have from TPS on the PS3 will port to the PS4, but that does not make up for the fact that I would have waited for the PS4 version if I knew it was going to come out.
By the way, don't bother saying that this is not a true PS4 port.  I don't know if it is or not and it DOES NOT MATTER.  The point is, regardless whether or not the game is just a PS3 quality game on the PS4, it's all about the ability to play the game on my PS4 where I do all my other gaming.  I would DEFINITELY have waited the 6 months for the convenience of playing it on my PS4 if I knew it was going to come out.

UPDATE:  I just got my copy of The Handsome Collection for the PS4, and I found out that in order to transfer my saved games from the PS3, I needed to update my PS3 version (WHICH I NO LONGER HAVE) to the latest version in order to export the games so I can load them on to my PS4.
THANKS!  And just in case you think I pulled the trigger too early on trading the game in, it is now $12.61 to trade in vs. the $16.91 that I did get.  So I would have lost another $4+ if I had waited.  $4 isn't much, but when I consider losing the original $60 I paid for the PS3 version in the first place. it's just all too sad.",0.002756451746724468

The thing that really pissed me off is the new proprietary USB cable they are now using; all of the prior devices had a MiniUSB cable, but this has what appears to be a perversion of an Apple connector- and these cables sell for $15 if you want a second one.  I will be returning my PSP Go as I do not want to carry a specific cable with me just to charge the non-removable battery.

The power charge plug is absent- replaced by charging over the USB cable (which plugs into the included power brick).  For one bit of irony, the PSP Go dock (sold seperately for $30) includes no cables- but it can accept power input from an older model PSP charger...

Next up is the omission of the UMD drive- which means you must purchase and download all games direct from Sony- at list price.  If you download a game directly to to PSP Go, you cannot use the device while downloading- which will take 45min - an hour (depending on the game)- and then the game must extract/install (taking another 5-10 minutes).  Using the PC desktop requires the PSP to be plugged in for download.  The only alternative to this is to download on a PS3 (which will do background downloading) and then extract the game to a USB attached PSP.

The change in form factor ensures that no devices made for the earlier model PSPs will work on this version; chargers/USB Cables/video output cables/GPS/camera/etc.

If you own a PSP and already have media on UMD and want to play it on your new PSP Go, you are pretty much screwed- unless you want to purchase a second copy at full list price.

While you may find some UMD games sale for $10-$15 at your local retailer, Sony usually wants you to pay a little more for the comparable download from their store- and also accept that you will not get a physical disc that can be traded/sold at a later date when you grow bored with the game.  The download games should be MUCH cheaper than their retail counter-parts; no media = no resale value for the end user.

The battery is non-removable and smaller so it lasts about 2-3 hours (max) if you are playing games.  Charging time is also 2-3 hours.

The analog stick feels pretty solid, but the location it is in makes it uncomfortable to use if you need to use the 'L Button' (now located behind the screen).

The volume control is located on top of the unit- which is behind the screen when it is opened- making me turn the unit over to change the volume level while playing a game.

I can go on, but I think you get the picture.

I don't see how Sony hopes to make this device work with all the hacks and limitations they have imposed on it.  Personally I believe that Sony is bitter over all the 'lost revenue' from games that were pirated on prior versions of the PSP, so they have changed everything so it is less usable- which only hurts the legitimate end user.",0.010042675632439622

911,1.0,"I am surprised at the high rated reviews this product has gotten. I am a fighting game enthusiast and know a good Dpad when I try one. I loved the old-school Nintendo Dpad, and the Playstation 2 Dpad is also very good. They offered precise feel and control. When I got my Xbox 360, I was shocked at how poor the Dpad was on that controller. Everything else, including the analog sticks are so perfect, but the Dpad is clumsy and ineffective. I'd try to hold back to block and end up jumping or doing some other random direction.
So after reading some reviews on different products, I thought I'd give the Madcatz fightpad a try. When I received the package, I already had a gut-feeling that it was no good. This was confirmed moments later as I tried to play with it.
1) The diagonals were very difficult to locate and I couldn't hit them with any consistency. Very bad news in a fighting game. I found that I had to hit a precise 30 degree angle from the down position to get down-back, and that should be 45 degrees, not 30. But this could have been a defect in the particular controller I got, and might not be an issue in others.
2) However, I'm sure for all of these controllers, the feel of the pad would be the same. The floating Dpad is very loosey-goosey. While this makes it very easy to throw fireballs, any slight pressure will move you away from your intended position. So if you needed to hold back to block, you might accidentally jump or duck.
3) The construction/material of the controller feels very light and cheap. This wouldn't have bothered me too much if the controller worked great but it didn't, and this only added to my disappointment.",0.001427045177045179

915,1.0,"FMA: Dual Sympathy is a rather flagrant ""cashing in on the franchise"" tie-in. It more or less summarizes the (first) anime, including screencaps from the show, interspersed with light platforming sections broken up with bad mini-games. There's really not a lot going for it other than having the FMA license--if it was a completely original IP, I don't think it'd get half the glowing reviews it has.

The core gameplay is a weak ""brawler"" game, where you run around and beat up some enemies (with or without Al's help, depending on who you play and when), interrupted periodically by random mini-games. For instance, the first stage playing through with Ed recreates the Elric brothers' journey to Leto, with a game version of the episode as an introduction (heads with dialogue) that segues into a short side-scrolling beat-em-up section (fighting Cornelo's guards) before getting to an altar, where you play a short ""Simon""-like mini-game (touch the dots in order as they appear). If you fail the mini-game, you have to play the (thankfully) short beat-em-up section again.

This progresses into another beat-em-up section, but there are only spikes to avoid (no enemies), and no clear indication as to how to pass longer stretches of spikes (create an alchemical wall and jump on it).

The boss battle is fine and challenging enough, and the resulting cutscene mimics the show, including Alphonse's monologue about Equivalent Exchange. However, it's very dry and lacks the emotion of the show.

The next stage replicates the train hijacking episode, and the mini-game is a weird ""untie Falman by sort-of tracing the rope"" thing.

The cutscenes are even worse--just Wikipedia-style summaries of what happens in the show--the clinical, minimal treatment of the Nina Tucker section was particularly upsetting. There really wasn't a reason to even bother including Nina if her story was going to be reduced to a Wikipedia stub. Anyone who plays this game without having seen the show is going to think 1. why should I care about Nina? and 2. I just got spoiled for the show, because the game version is a poor substitute, lacking any emotional depth.

Now, I would like to play through the whole thing anyway, just to be certain I'm not unfairly judging the game based on the hamhanded treatment of one scene, but 1. the platforming sections are not fun, and 2. the mini-games are REALLY not fun, and if you don't pass them, you can't progress further in the game until you do, so I ended up stuck at the incredibly unforgiving stealth mini-game (get the fish from the masked guy on the island) just because I could NOT work out the timing for sneaking past.

I sincerely believe this game was made to check off a checklist item, not because they were making a superb game (because they didn't). I'm glad I got it as a trade-in at a used game store, because it's not worth paying money for this game. Traded it back first chance I got!

The game bugged out on me in training and I couldn't drive the truck like I was supposed to. I gave up on it and a week later my computer basically tanked. I assumed that was part of the problem with the game, as I was having trouble with other games that used to play fine. I happened to have lost the game for some time and I finally found it in a box in my parent's house two years ago. I took it and finally played it a while back and I was completely at odds with the demo I remembered so well and resurrected to play before starting the game again. The game played nothing like the demo and I swear that I was losing EVERY mission even if the goals got completed. I never understood how to use the ""tactical map"" for a long time and when I finally figured it out, it still didn't help. The friendly AI has as much sense as a cardboard box, the enemies are apparently sharpshooters with tanks, and it seems that while you only take 1-3 bullet wounds to die, the enemy takes at least 10.

In this game you hold the A button to change to attack mode and then blindly run into the enemy to hope that you win. If you die you lose everything and start all over from the beginning, and you will die a lot in this game.

The sound is horrible, the music is the same seven second loop of a theme that sounds very much like the Indiana Jones theme song.

The graphics are okay for the NES I suppose, I can't knock those too much since the system wasn't that powerful.

The save system is misleading and led to a very angry me. In the menu there is an option to save, load and password. I hate passwords and so I just saved and quit. Well the carriage has no internal battery, so the save only works for if it is still on. You have to use the really long password to reload your game. And of course it changes every single time you access the password screen.

Click to play, configuration tool crashes over and over - BAD.

/figure out a way around configuration tool by starting the game through a 2ndary launcher inbeded in the program files. /successfully launched skipping the configuration tool.

So that was frustrating.

Gameplay - BAD

First issue, Crashes caused by conversations with npcs, which occurred from the start of the game and plagued it until the end, when it first happen windows gave a solution of a Mass Effect 1 Patch - which was easy enough to download and install but DIDN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE...  Its completely RANDOM when it happens sometimes a npc will trigger it, sometimes not.  LOL it literally says ""file not found"" and crashes, restart and Presto it works VERY RANDOM but must of restarted me 12+ times.  SAVE before EACH and Every NPC you talk to - to limit annoyance.

Cover system made of fail - pulls you into cover just by walking next to something awkward, and bad angles.

Item Cap of 150 /fail *blinks* if your already allowing me to carry around 100+items why the heck is there a cap at all?  And sorting the inventory out was a pain.  Games in general need to stop adding Caps like this, FF7 was great and you could hold 99 of everything.

Actual fighting/gameplay a form of torture clunky, clunky, CLUNKY - don't bother with cover its useless.

Land Rover - giggity, whoever thought it was a good idea or even fun needs ran over by it.  Its like they never took the time to explore their own maps with it, getting stuck going up a hill and falling back down IS NOT FUN.  Which brings me to another point, whoever designed their map levels needs to lay off the obsessive amount of mountains on EVERY planet.  It was INCREDIBLY unfun having to explore with the rover, when it bounces around like a weightless rag-doll on every little bump and don't have enough power to climb a hill.

Elevators - HORRIBLE you'll spend alot of time just tapping your foot waiting on the obnoxiously long elevator rides THAT ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN THE GAME.......
its actually a ""thank god"" moment when you run into a short elevator ride in the game YEAH ITS THAT BAD... 3-5 minutes stuck in a elevator staring at the screen is unacceptable especially considering they are so FREQUENT.

Sniper rifle wobble - Shepard on some kind of drug?  is he/she not a trained soldier?  Why can't he hold it still?  Even when you get the ability to add 2 25% weapon stability upgrades it's shake is pretty bad...  I'll never understand what was going through their head on this one.  As a amateur hunter i don't have any issue with shaking my gun like I'm hopped up on sugar pops OR WORST...

Story - Wasn't bad.

i think i might of liked it better than Me2, at least the end bad guy wasn't a ridiculous ""HUMAN REAPER"" oh noes!  - why they would even mechanically choose such a shape just shows lack of creativity.  Which truth be told this series lacks in spades.

Generally Clunkyness of the game and crash frustrations ruin any immersion.

Take note my machine far surpasses its recommended system requirements by a tremendous length.

It did some things better than Me2

For example every star system you go to has ""something"" to do in it.  But that is cut asunder by the horrible land rover you get to explore the planets with.

No Ammo was a cool idea, only overheating.

Ability to Sell stuff for Credits - this is good, but ultimately useless as there is very little worth buying, and the 150 item cap drove me insane. - I ended with 9,999,999 (max) useless credits.

overall if i would of played this before Me2 i wouldn't of bought Me2 cus the genre would be dead to me.  Me2 is at least playable.

And there are about 15 games in total, out of which only 2 or 3 are any good, and even then the fatal system flaws lead to them being well nigh unplayable.  Multiplayer is wireless and adequately implemented, but that's about the only plus, and there's only a couple of titles taking advantage of that, too.  After such a stupendous release as the GBA SP (perfection in design if there ever was any), such horrible design is inexcusable.  I know this is practically flogging a dead horse, but the message must be made loud and clear, lest a huge number of children become disappointed come Christmas.  Please, just say no.  Buy a GBA SP for half the price and get your kid a cellphone to accompany it with the remaining money (see, there's two of the functions the N-Gage has already!).  It's time that companies like this taking advantage of heedless customers with shoddy merchandise be stopped.  Disengage the N-Gage.",-0.013483299108299108
954,1.0,"i thought i was buying a FPS but who knows what the developers were trying to create with this. it goes from sneaky/stealth to puzzle solving to platformer to FPS. to frustrate things even more, the subtitles are microscopic and the voice acting was done by out-of-work pornstars. you either need a theater-sized tv or plenty of patience if you even care as to what's going on with the story. and what a story it is (granted four chapters was all i could handle). you alternate segments between a young retarded lad named billy and his grisled, bloodthirsty yet also retarded preacher uncle. billy's missions are all about stealth and running like a coward. if you try to take down any of your adversaries, 20 more magically appear and instantly kill you. his uncle is a drunk killing machine, which is actually somewhat fun until the game throws a 3rd grade puzzle at his 1st grade logic and jumping ability. lastly i'd like to mention how glitchy this game is. i walked into town to hear the same ""cow moo"" sound effect stuck on repeat for a good five minutes. NPC's repeat the same lines over and over as well. and more often than not, i'd find myself walking towards what looked like an ocean only to have mountains suddenly materialize in the horizon. same thing with buildings. and sometimes, you can magically warp into these mystery buildings and be stuck there forever, how fun!! don't buy this thinking it's ""gun 2"". don't buy this game because good games are scarce in the summer. just don't buy this for any reason!!",-0.004252310342419516
955,1.0,"Cute...as a 24 year old gamer (at the more casual end of hardcore)...I really wanted to like this game. It seemed quite original and inspired...I had tons of fun for the first hour, then the fun rapidly dropped off into frustration and boredom. The first few levels I played, I looked everywhere for things to collect; but, after a few levels, I stopped looking and went through the levels as fast as I could ... assuming a point to the game would emerge later on -- it didn't.

So, single player was a pretty huge failure for me. It didn't engage my interest for very long, so I tried it in 2 player mode with my 28 year old girl friend. She thought it was pretty cute, and she kind of enjoyed it. The idea of collecting outfits suited her better, but she wouldn't play more than 1 level a week - if she played at all...but she doesn't and neither do I.

If mindlessly collecting cutesy ""things"" to outfit your character and placing stickers on objects in a game is your thing, you will love this game. The game isn't any more interesting if my sack is wearing a zebra outfit or is naked....it's all mindlessly boring. Unfortunately, I believe the game suffers from a poor vision...somebody came up with an interesting idea (although not as original as people think) idea but couldn't think of any use for it...the result was a semi-original, but utterly pointless, unengaging game. Perhaps the shred of originality is to be credited not to the idea that nobody has thought of it before, but nobody was dumb enough to implement it because they assumed nobody would actually play it.

Some of you can relate to this comparison well: Counterstrike...except you can change your outfit, you don't do anything except jump around a level without interacting with anybody. Placing stickers is like tagging things...imagine how long that'd be fun...running around a level, changing your clothes, and tagging things with cute pictures.

I can't recommend this game to anybody except MAYBE (and that's a big maybe) kids ... young girls more than boys. Unfortunately, in the end, it was a waste of money for me.",0.018462994785368482
956,1.0,"WARNING: Bug-ware alert

After paying my $50 for this game, I loaded the three CDs required, rebooted my computer, expecting to play all night long.

Much to my surprise, I'd launch the icon to start the game, and it would give me an error and exit as it got to the main menu - each and every time.  I made 12 attempts, still nothing.  My computer is a 2005-model HP Pavillion with fast Pentium 4 and 1 GB RAM.  Definitely should be able to handle this game.

Being resourceful, I found the technical support site.  I wasn't too shocked to find a significant number of people who also had this problem too.  And the publisher does NOT have any answers for them -- certainly not when or if it will be fixed.  (They already have your money, and aren't giving it back.)  I'm still awaiting my answer too!

961,1.0,"Top dollar for a game that can be beaten in one or two sittings. What a scam. I guess the two year development was spent removing content. PC gamers put CoD on the map and they turn around and spit in our faces. I'm embarrassed that I spent my hard earned dollars on this turd and am really kicking myself for not checking the reviews here first.
The Pros:
Amazing Graphics, really polished visuals with varied and beautiful locales.
Gritty, adult oriented story and missions.
Very intense single player battles
The Cons:
I bought this at 8pm last night and I just beat it. It's 10am now and yes, I got a full night's sleep between then and now.
Multiplayer is some kiddy console matchmaker system that doesn't make use of servers.
9v9 max for multiplayer. No epic battles here.
No servers means no huge battles, no custom maps, no mods, to sum it up: NO RE-PLAYABILITY.
Steam. I'm not in the ""Steam=SecuROM"" camp but I still think it sucks. I've found it to be buggy and unreliable and I resent being forced to use it to play a supposed A-list game.
The single player campaign is fun despite being so short. I'll probably play through it once more today, maybe spend a day or two on the wimpy and dull multiplayer, then put this game on the shelf and dream of what else I could have spent my money on. Tomorrow or the next day, after I uninstall it (along with that stupid Steam program) I'll play a World at War custom map on a server with 31 other frag happy gamers.
Conclusion:
Wait until this hits the bargain bin. This game is more of an expansion than a full release. The single player campaign is worth maybe $20-$30 while the multiplayer is an affront to all things PC gamers hold dear. Seriously, if I wanted to play an Xbox game I would buy an Xbox.

965,1.0,"If you look at my reviews you will see i don't write them =)But i felt this was something I had to write because if you are looking to spend close to 200 dollars on something then you should know. This is a game made to extract money from you nothing more it is a game that asked you to pay to play but really dosnt offer much in return .When i started playing this game about a year ago i was in love with the story and the lore the way all the things kinda made since good vs eveil etc and it worked for me sucked me in like no game had in a long time. I could even ignore the holes somewhat in there expansion cata ....Now here is where it really falls off the path and into the abiss panda is a cash machine and not a game reason are simple it isn't done and at the rate it is going you will always be bored.
1.when you start you do missions and build up points to lvl nothing new here but some of the things you find are super strong for the last expansion so say before the expansion you had a fight with a lvl 85 boss it was kinda hard now with the new foods and gear you might be able to beat him with just half the people it took before ....WHY they want you to be bored and have to buy the expansion.
2. You do the missions and if you even remotely hardcore and spend some time playing it is a week before you blow you way pass all the new stuff and are lvl 90 hence they say this is the real game comming to life and that is DAILES all the time about 3 different sets of dailes so you can get rep with factions to buy better gear so you can go into harder raids to get better gear got it ?

3. The raids you need the gear for are not out they say they will be at a rate of maybe 1 every 2 weeks and then there are not that many .Example i have a gear item lvl of 475 there is a requierment of 470 for my next raid but there is not NEXT raid also my gear is so good when i go to a lower raid or dung it is way to easy.

4. Crafted items you need to make to make you guy even more power ful are on a timer so say you want to put a spell on a sword to make it more powerful well it takes a crafter 20 days to make just one spell so if you duel wield you will need 2 scrolls and that is another payday for the game maker and you better hope you don't find a better swrod because that another 20 days  this pretty much kills the economy of the game and makes skills stupid .

5This is the worst of all if makes you hate to play it takes away the joy of playing because your in a dog eat dog game now no working together because most things can be killed alone so people don't need to group so they just fly over your head and killsteal a npc you were waiting to kill and even say rude things as they do it. The game brings out the bad in people and it shows.

6. I read someplace they sold 2 mil copies of this game and with that many people playing and paying that is close to 400 mil a year to this game maker and for that i would expect more then 2 weeks of content and then nothing but grind for a piece of gear that i cant use because i am already to high of a item lvl as it is to make any fight hard and i have to deal with all the other issues spoken of here already.

7So cash machine people always talk about the FREE market well this is the end game people all the good game makers have been bought out and all we have left is a group of people who know they have you by the shorts and don't care anymore they just want thier next bonus for getting a bunch of people to buy junk i of course don't play anymore and i hope you don't buy it because you just going to waste your time and money on a peice of junk.",-0.007937321207833348

978,1.0,"I guess when it comes to computer games, sequals are always much worse than the original.  They always take the novel, fun concept of the original, and ruin it by adding tons of complications to it.  Thats the case here, more complex dosnt mean more fun.

All the new features are ok in theory, but of course very few of them actually work the way they're supposed to.  Even after patching to 1.2, sometimes i'll get piles of ""gong"" all over the castle, while my gong farmers just stand around doing nothing.  The only fix for this seems to be deleting all my structures, and then starting over.

The first Stronghold focused mainly on defense, with only a few attack missions.  I found that to be a very nice change of pace, i don't recall ANY game that ever focused purely on defense before.  Of course, the second one seems to mainly be an attack based game.  The castles aren't nearly as strong as they were in the first one.  Most siege weapons can destroy even the strongest castle in a matter of seconds (as well as your brave defenders now).  But the gameplay and features of the game are moot points, the big problem is the game flat out dosnt work.

The 3-d graphics suck, let's face it.  I'm not really picky about graphics, but whats strikes me is that the graphics are very poor...yet the game runs like it's Doom freaking 5; lots of waiting times and choppyness.  In fact, the game itself can take upwards of around 3-5 minutes just to boot up.  This is on a high end gaming computer as well.

What really upsets me though, is i tried playing the game all the way through, even though i didn't really enjoy it all that much.  I got about halfway, and then suddenly the game just started crashing every 15 seconds on a particular mission.  I wrote tech support, and after about a week of writing back and forth, their only suggestion was to reinstall the game.  I did that, started all over, enjoying it even less this time and when i got to that mission again, i found it still crashed.  As it is now, the game is completely unplayable, and i've given up.

No such luck, that improvement was just too sophisticated.  The real disappointment though was the much hyped online match making.

Instead they have the most simple rating system imaginable, one that is often cheated at by the way.  The end result is that a very good player can just be paired with a less skilled player allowing the master player to mop the map with everyone.  All in a supposedly balanced game.

The little nubs helped to keep a hold of the controller when the action got intense and my hands got sweaty. For that reason, I gave these 2 stars.

The trouble starts when you want to charge them. I have a charging dock that the controllers slide into to charge. Needless to say the covers have to be removed to place on the charger. Not a big deal, BUT beware, if you have just finished playing and want to charge the controller, you have probably been playing for a short while and the controller is warm from your body heat as is the cover. This is where the problem starts, at least for me. As I was removing the cover, something I had done many times before, a small tear occurred on the back side on the inside of the hand grip area. Over time and more use this tear grew to the point of the cover being useless. Then the second cover, one that I did not use as much, started to feel sticky. I washed it in warm water, seemed to help some.

Since silicone is prone to getting this sticky feeling and my wife has some silicone backing items that she cleans in the dishwasher I thought it would be safe and sanitary to clean these covers in the dishwasher. I do not heat dry my dishes, I let them air dry and the covers got the same treatment. The second one became real loose fitting and at this point they both ended up in the garbage.

If you are looking for something to add to your controllers for some better grip and game play, look for Real Triggers, here on Amazon.

Well, I wouldn't know about that, as I can't get through the tutorial without getting a massive headache.  Why, you ask?  The font is too small.  I do not know why, but this seems to be a problem that not many reviewers have picked up on.

Even in 800 X 600 mode on a 19 inch monitor, you have to sit about one foot away from the screen to read the text clearly. This does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a trend toward using barely ledgible font in many new PC games.

I must defer any other commentary about the game's ""bugginess"" to the other reviewers.  I salute them for being able to play it even for a little while.

While the program occupies 2 DVDs worth of content, you will immediately log online and download almost 3 DVDs worth of patches that take HOURS to install. Pray you have a fast fast fast computer and really high speed broadband.

Once the system is installed things start out OK.  It is not as user-friendly an introduction as World of Warcraft (the current ""gold standard"" of RPGs), but you'll figure things out quickly if you've played an MMO before. Continuing to play, however, is hit-or-miss.  I have about  6 friends trying this game.  Every one of them has had frequent crashes.  On my system, the game freezes after about 5 minutes of play , guaranteed.

There is NO customer support for the product.  You can e-mail FUNCOM, but don't expect to get any reply at all. I've posted in the forums and no one has reported ever getting any reply to a question, whether its about a technical issue or possible fraud capturing passwords. This is just unacceptable.

And believe me I'm dodging and rolling around like a cartoon character and I have no more health injections, I'm using my traps and powers and I still can't kill these guys. Super frustrating combat that is way too hard early on in the game and not fun.

Synapse/Surround Pro is also very ugly and the drivers never install correctly, leaving off the option for ""surround sound controller"" from the playback devices selection, meaning you don't get surround in games that auto select 2.0 stereo for stereo headphones which is all these will show up as. What's weird is that the option for Razer surround sound controller was there when I first installed it, then an update came through and erased the option from playback devices. Uninstalling and reinstalling synapse and surround pro would not bring it back. Razer support is very slow and worthless as well. They tried to tell me that there is no need for the Razer surround sound controller in playback devices which is complete bs and is very obvious if you have listened to them using both options and know that there is a huge difference. The guy even acted like he had no idea that the option should even be there even though lots of people on their forums mention it and ask whether to use the surround sound controller option or the stereo headphones option (surround sound controller for anything surround, stereo for music). Add to all this a $160 price tag and a very short 1 year warranty and you have a recipe for needing to buy a new set of headphones in just over a year. REALLY, Razer?

The game is not a true sequel as the whole game takes place after War for Cybertron but before Fall of Cyberton. It's a side story really, it starts in the Movie fictional world and it's about certain event that happens in the past and you replay those events that occured in the Games universe.

The Movie universe parts of the game are events that happen just after the movie.

Graphics are probably the worst of the whole series, super pixelated paired with the poorest AI and voice acting possible. Even the PS2 and Original XBOX could have pushed out a similar looking game.

The game and it's story serves no purpose other than to sell something titled Transformers at the same time a slew of Toy and Movie comes out the same time and to gouge every dollar from you.

**** - BEWARE - SPOILERS BELOW - *********

They talk about Multiverses and your not sure if the events of the game really relate to each other in the movie world because everything is super vague in details. The main object in the game you really never see it in it's true glory, it's more of a tease than a plot.

The ending is the worse as it basically says that your time is wasted in the game *****SPOILER***** because The Dark Spark (The Decepticon Matrix) travels the multiverse and when it leaves the movie universe at the very end it goes back the Game universe and then the credits roll. So it may be the next TRUE sequel to Fall of Cybertron.

As a one person game, Resident Evil Outbreak does not live up to its predecessors.  Gone is any semblance of a plot.  This is unfortunate since most of the charm of the prior incarnations of this game came from the storyline.
Gone also are intuitive controls.  Here you have to load each bullet into your gun.  Haven't any of these people ever heard of clips.  And most frustrating is the snail pace with which the characters accomplish every task.  Unless you are running which is immpossible to maintain if you are trying to accomplish anything else, you move at the rate of 1 mile an hour.

I regret giving up my Xbox 360 with a decent collection of games (including Kinect-enabled ones) - because there is still a huge gap between the games available for the One and 360. As an example, Limbo debited 3+ years ago on Xbox 360, and it just came out on Xbox One. I enjoyed Fruit Ninja over 2 years ago, and it's still not available for Xbox One!! Such a let-down.

Please explain why they made a new console that won't play Xbox 360 games? That's really stupid, and I have only myself to blame because I trusted Microsoft to port existing games quickly, since they've decided to break compatibility on purpose.

I would also like to point out that Xbox One games/apps are sluggish despite the up-to-date hardware. For example, Xbox Fitness is absolutely painful to use, as it loads a full minute (which feels like an eternity) and all animations and transitions are horribly rough.

Another source of frustration is the dashboard UI. Browsing for games (which I do frequently, hoping to find something interesting) is very confusing?! It's either one flat list of all games, or poorly defined categories with very limited number of titles. And I can't still figure out how to rate and review games/apps...

Finally, the prices for games for purchase on the console (downloadable) are regularly ~2 times higher than same titles on a disc (e.g. Amazon). That's just a shameless rip-off. They are definitely not passing the savings (media/distribution/commissions) on to consumers.",-0.017657639289517846

There is probably only handful of combos you can pull off, and they all [stink]. Also, the voice acting and overall audio in the game is terrible; for example, one of the mini-bosses that one will encounter in the game, will say: ""You are dead"" in such a monotone manner that you probably will die in your seat from disgust. Taunting like that happens throughout the whole game, which is possible to beat in as little as 5 short hours. Additionally, the game's visuals are horrible too, even though there are some Xbox-specific graphical features, the game runs extremely choppy. The biggest problem is the loading time, which adds up to the choppiness and makes it even worse. First, when the level is picked, it will take like a minute or even more to load. Then, there will be loads after every time the player advances to a new scene in the same level. And finally, there will be yet another load when the player quits to the main menu.

1044,1.0,"I love the ""call of duty"" games in general, so I bought this version for the wii. It is abhorrent.

 The controls are often backwards, and change from scene to scene, such as when spotting enemies for a tank in the beginning, you have to use the minus(-) button to ""fire"" but later on, it is a different button. When using mortars and anti-tank guns, you have to rotate the wii controller to position the gun to fire, and it always seems backwards from what it should be. The heavy machine guns don't aim like the real thing, and they are useless compared to the normal machine guns, such as the Thompson or the MP30.
 Maps: If you aren't paying attention, it is easy to get turned around and have to wander a bit to find the location that you are supposed to be at.

 Fighting Mode: Absolutely idiotic. there are I think, three places in the game where you have to fight an opponent, and the controls for it are nothing like what you would actually do... and you cannot avoid these fights. The first time I encountered it, I had a heck of a time figuring out what the on screen directions were trying to tell me to do, so I ended up swinging the remotes wildly in all directions till I found something that worked. It wasn't anything like what the on screen directions were indicating at all. You can not fight any other characters in the game in this way, only those three enemies.

The arrow keys - Controls for grenades, switching guns, and fighting - often do whatever the want, so you end up throwing a grenade instead of switching guns.

Sensitivity: needed to be adjusted almost all the way off in order to keep from spinning wildly around when turning. You would think that you would only have to adjust if the controller was too slow or something.

Shooting: you can shoot the enemy in the head three or four times, and he just gets right back up, but if he shoots you twice, you're done for. This sometimes flip-flops around, and you suddenly find that you can take 30 hits before dying. It is not relevant to what level of the game you are on either, i.e. it doesn't necessarily get harder the further you go.

Tanks and Jeeps: the controls for these are quite different, and the tank is idiotically hard to drive. I ended up holding down the button to align the tank to the turret, all the way through, just so I could drive it correctly.

The ending: What a let down. I was waiting for the ""Final Battle"" when I realized it was already all over.

My final real pet peeve: I don't like having to sit through the cut-scenes(movies), that's what I buy movies for, not video games. Seriously, HALF of the game you are sitting through these, and you can't push a button to skip them. The storyline that they are attempting to create is stupid, and has little continuity.
 It goes like this: Cut-scene....walk into a building... cut-scene......fire at enemies for 3 minutes......cut-scene......walk into another building and fight for 3 minutes.........cut-scene....

Sigh. I just have to wonder who it is that makes the final decision on these games sometimes....was it the head of the ""Art Department""????????? EVERY SINGLE game that has these, there are always people complaining about them, and yet - they keep putting them in. I thought the object of making video games was to SELL THEM, NOT TO ANNOY YOUR CUSTOMERS.

This review is about the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, the feeling that I'm about to lose an old friend. That PC gaming as I've known and loved it for many years is dying, and will soon be dead. Murdered by greed.
The future is here and it is scary: Ownership transformed into glorified game rental. Games infected with spyware, data miners or flat out Malware. A time when the gamers who made gaming a bigger industry than Hollywood will now be treated like thieves and pirates.

If you've been a PC gamer for more than a dozen years like myself, you probably have a pretty awesome collection of games, both new and old. The beauty of PC games vs. console games is that even when you upgrade your hardware, there as ALWAYS ways to play your old games without keeping ten different gaming systems in your closet. I can pull out my copy of Alpha Centauri and start playing it anytime I like, no vintage system required. PC games have always been excellent when it comes to replay value. Sadly, that is not longer the case.

PC game manufacturers have taken it into their heads that what we consumers really want is to RENT games. AKA: installation limits. We don't want to OWN anything, just rent a game for 3, 5, or maybe even a dozen installations (the number is not important) and then our games will cease to work. If we want to continue to play those games, we're forced to BUY ANOTHER COPY.

I bet I've installed my copy of Alpha Centauri over fifty times across 15 or so different computers or upgraded OS, and I'll probably continue to play it into the future. Sadly, anyone buying Far Cry 2 will not have that option. At some point in the not-so-distant future, their install limit will be reached, and the game will be useless.

Why is this happening? Because of greed. Because companies like EA, Ubisoft, and others are putting their bottom line ahead of their customer's best interests. Ultimately however, they're doing it BECAUSE WE ARE LETTING THEM. It's high time that as a class we stop giving money to companies that treat us like dishonest pick-pockets instead of paying customers. Only by NOT BUYING games that come with installation limits can we effect change.

Happily, there are exceptions(check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Witcher-Enhanced/dp/B001AH8YSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Witcher Enhanced</a>&nbsp;for example). Some companies are realizing that gamers and pirates are two different species. Pirates will steal games regardless. Gamers will pay for them as long as the system is fair, and as long as gaming companies show them a little respect.

I choose to spend my money where I get treated like a valued customer. Ubisoft has chosen to treat me like a thief, therefore I will not give them my money. I will buy my games from companies that respect the art form and the people who love it the most. People like me and you.

Far Cry 2 itself is a nice FPS shooter. But I won't be buying it. The cost is just too high.",-0.016789763788960885
1048,1.0,"Black Flag seems like a great pirates game, at first. But the more you play it, the more you realize that it's just another Assassin's Creed game with the same flawed saving mechanic and poor controls. Instead of giving you the option to save whenever you'd like, the game forces you to go back to the last checkpoint. The controls are still too loose, resulting in you the player being put into some awkward situations because Edward feels like clinging to a tree branch. This WILL get you killed more then once. The worst part of it all is that this game has no learning curve. Instead of taking a fun concept and working with the player, the early missions become unneededly difficult. This game is so bad, that it isn't worth talking about the great things that I liked about it. You're better off renting it or borrowing it from a buddy if possible.

Ever since Grand Theft Auto III came out, the position of videogames in pop culture has gone up tremendously. Games are about to topple movies as the leading form of entertainment. Filmmaker Uwe Boll has made several (absoultely terrible) game-based movies. What was once seen as a geeky hobby has now becomes one of the coolest things you can do.

This, in my opinion, is a terrible development. One of the best advantages to being a game geek was that it got you as far away from the jocks/preps/cheerleaders as you possibly could, and now, those exact same popular kids are the ones buying PS2/XBOX(360)/GCs, and popping games into it.

Games like the Madden series (along with 95% of all other EA Games) are the exact reason why this has happened. EA makes games that appeal to these low-lifes and as a result, the preps now play video games. They are sure to load every one of their games with all sorts of prep-friendly devices such as mainstream rap soundtracks, lots of glitter and bling, and all sorts of ""totally pimp"" slang so that they look intune with the current pop culture.

Need For Speed: Underground II and NBA Live are two perfect examples of this atrocity. However, football games in particular are guilty of this, because every type of ""popular kid"" can find something in one that relates to them in real life. Jocks like football games because they play football. Cheerleaders like football games because they participate in them (even though cheerleading is boring to watch, and it doesn't have any effect on a football team's morale). Preps who aren't associated with either of these like them because they go to high school football games because their sense of school spirit tells them to. You might be able to put marching band into this category, except for the fact that they participate in that for their love of music, not for their love of football.

Of course, the real video game players will always look towards the Japanese RPGs, niche games, and platformers that no prep would ever go near, but that's not the point. What is, is that the fact that football games inspire preps to get into gaming is just annoying and destroys individuality. Why can't they just stay where they belong?

If you think that the music you listen to is the best because it's the most popular, buy this game. If you go to parties on the weekend so you can get ""DrUnK oFf Ur AsS"", buy this game. If you shop at Abercrombie and Fitch or Hollister for your clothes, buy this game. If you're a REAL gamer who agrees with this review, then for the love of God, do NOT buy this game.",0.02390638114167822

1055,1.0,"This was a long awaited title and one of the most hyped launches of its kind ever, and for that reason I found it brutally disappointing. Its just 2-bit gangsters in LA California all over again. Somewhere new would have been nice for starters. The location and the plot is just too repetitious for a title this big! So why not change the theatre to Space, Underwater, History? I don't care, just something new! Why not be brave and even set the next game in.......China: ... The Great Wall, Leshan Park / Big Budda, Longman Grottos, Hong Kong, Shangri-la... Don't like those? Then how about Italy: Venice, Florence, Rome, Monselice, Italian Alps? Still don't like any of those? Then how about Japan or Dubai? Either way folks, treat yourselves to some travel, you definitely have the resources!

The same 2-bit characterless gangster portrayals bring few surprises either. In fact this game does no one any favours. Hello? The world has moved on! My lady has a suggestion for a change of plot. Why not use the film Taken (2008) as a base? ...Justifiable on-screen violence against bad guys trafficking women. There's an emotional angle too for anyone interested in emotioneering in video-gaming! It would be better than dumb gangsters bring cynical corporate profits! Some people might think this is unduly harsh, but the video gaming talent pool is unbelievably high. However, GTA V is more like Hollywood and its endless cycle of reboots, reshoots and sequels.

Sure, the GTA V map terrain is a little more detailed, the mountains have higher peaks, and the cars look and handle a bit better. But Driver-SF still pips it with a higher frame-rate, and Saints Row III is just more fun. The rest is just bland, bland, bland. They've long run out of ideas, much like the twin-studios that kick out Call-Of-Duty titles every year on a corporate schedule! Yes, there are 3 GTA characters to follow this time, each with their own special skill, but its so gimmicky its not even half-hearted RPG. Overall, 3 messes just make more of a mess! No thanks!

========================================
Update April 2014
========================================

To those who argue the graphics are great and that negative reviewers have never played the game...

First off the graphics aren't first rate. They were back in 2008 with GTA4 maybe, but not now! At best GTA5's graphics are an incremental improvement over GTA4, but not enough considering the long development time. There are now vastly superior open-world driving titles with better graphics such as Driver-San Francisco, and even that isn't anything new. (And no, I'm no fan of Ubisoft and their DRM from hell before you ask).

The graphics are poor in GTA5 and its because they've failed to develop their Rage engine. You can see it in the frame Rate and Rendering. During a chase scene especially, the graphics of GTA lack clarity and are more blurry than Driver-SF, and this is primarily because the frame rate is much lower in GTA, and because the rendering system lacks clarity!

Its possible there are more meshes and varying terrains and landscapes with more animations in GTA. But Driver-SF is just more clever in how it renders the scene, and ultimately this is a high-paced driving game and so clarity really matters. The game could have been improved upon before release. But I think the development team have become decadent and lazy because of past success. Also, a lot of their better developers have left, especially in Rockstar North!

I played the game for 60+ hours, so I think that counts as having played it. Yes, there's a lot to do as there was in the GTA3 series and which GTA4 lacked. But its all very repetitive and not well thought out. In short there's nothing new here, and it lacks the charm of earlier titles. For example aircraft in the game still handle poorly. And while you can steal a jet from the military base and take it for a ride, you only get seconds of fuel to go joyriding! The tanks are too slow and boring too and there's only incremental improvement in the bikes and cars. I prefer driving real cars in open-world driving games, and there's too few exotic and interesting cars in this franchise to keep my attention. Who wants to drive a Truck? This is a video game, so I want to drive a Ferrari!

Don't get me started about the AI either. Rockstar just haven't done anything new in this area. Player actions on the city are non-existent also, and this is a wasted opportunity if ever there was one.

There's a lot of swearing because the game is shallow with its never ending 2-bit gangster portrayals. The earlier series had lots of swearing too but they had more charm. When swearing exists just to hide a dearth of new ideas, that's when the series becomes stale and should be dropped.",-0.01030963586326103

1057,1.0,"I finally bought this game about a week ago after reading amazing reviews on it, and I must say I felt very mislead. I was expecting at least a little bit more of a traditional RPG with more realistic game play. TWEWY was far from what I expected. From the first time I booted it up, I thought ""oh no.. this looks cheesy - I'm going to hate this game"", but I gave it a chance anyway. After way too much ridiculous dialogue involving two characters that you can't help but hate, the game finally begins (sort of..). I finally got into the combat part of the game, which I absolutely hate. It feels like a mix of Dance Dance Revolution and Final Fantasy 2. You are expected to control two characters at once: one at the top of your screen, and the other at the bottom. On the bottom you run around in an extremely limited space using different attacks while trying to avoid the enemy. While doing this, you are expected to follow a pattern of buttons to push to control the character on the top screen, which I have found impossible, as I am not a chamelean and my eyes do not look in different directions at once. If you ignore the bottom screen for more than a second, you get bombarded by enemies. After trying to figure it out, I found it too difficult to resist the urge to destroy my DS by slamming it against the coffee table, so I just left the top screen on autoplay (which apparently the autoplay does a terrible job and makes it impossible to achieve higher than a C on any battle, which hinders game play.)

  So now I officially hate: the gameplay, the characters, and the combat. I decide ""Hell, 98% of people on Amazon loved the game, so lets keep going and try and see what they see."" I played a few more hours, gathered a few more ""pins"", and all I discovered is that 98% of people on Amazon are morons. I must say though, I hate the characters a little bit less. But I definitely hate the game much more. Boss battles have become extremely difficult because I have no choice but let the computer control my 2nd character - but wait! I have the ability to switch the game to ""easy"". I read reviewers say they like this aspect, but to me it's a cop out. Square Enix failed to make a consistent game and decided it would be easier to have us switch difficulties throughout the game than to fix it. In this reviewers opinion, Square Enix failed to make a tolerable game. I am surprised to see that anyone enjoyed it, and baffled as to how so many people loved it. Hands down one of the worst games I have ever played, and this is coming from a huge Square Enix fan.

1061,1.0,"I always loved the orginal Zoo tycoon on the computer. So when I saw Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS, I picked up a copy thinking I could have the same amount of fun, only portable. I was wrong. The game is nothing like the original. It's much simpler, and you can't really build impressive zoos. In the orginal game, you hire workers to care for the animals. You can still do that in the DS game, but I still found myself trying to care for the animals. And by care, I mean play annoying little minigames. You're options are severly limited in this version. You can't  build large, good looking areas for guests to sit and eat. There's only a couple buildings you can build, and even with research, there's not that much to build. And it's not even worth it to make buildings anyway. In the orginal Zoo tycoon, it was easy to make several buildings, and they would all generate a lot of profits. In this game, no one even bothers. THe upkeep is almost always more than the money earned. So it's a loss. My finalm complaint is the size. You're only allowed 30 animals, and there's very little space. I filled up over half my zoo with 5 exhibits.

This game seemed to have so much potential. The first Tycoon games were great. But, you can do a lot more in that game, even though it was made several years ago. Even the graphics in the sequel didn't come close to the original. This version was so downgraded, it lost what made the game fun.

If you want to play single player you are forced to put up with the most retarded AI players you have ever witnessed in your entire life.  The AI doesn't defend worth a sh%t, and all they ever do, the AI supposedly on your team, is get directly between u and the goal you are trying to make.  Or they clear the ball from the opponents goal when you just killed yourself trying to get it centered for a goal attempt.
If you want to play online multiplayer then you suffer from many of the worst human beings who ever occupied this planet, true scum, trolls from hell.  And then the worst part.  People who have been playing for years play at the same levels as new or inexperienced players which results in teams always, always being unfair.  You never get to play an honest game to test you fairly for your skills.  Sure sometimes you will win and some you will lose.  The irritation is that you spend hundreds even thousands of hours getting good at controlling your car and learning the ropes just to never play fairly matched players in the game.  And the makers of this game want it that way.  Because if they made it truly fair then their old, cheating players would leave, and that would cause the makers lose money off of sales, selling tires, paint jobs, etc...
Do yourself a favor and do not buy.  It pulls you into an endless hell-of-frustration for absolutely NO long term benefit.
Could be a great game if the makers were not greedy allowing so much cheating.  But hey if you don't mind being cheated then I guess it would be fun, not rewarding long term.  But it does cause the release of strings of endorphins, short term, momentary tiny-highs.

1086,1.0,"Stunning. Who would have guessed that a sequel to such an amazing game would be this bad.

It's a hard formula to mess up. But god bless em', Codemasters found a way. They actually managed to make a game based on pillaging, destruction, and outright chaos...boring. And that's exactly what Overlord II is, it's boring.

The original featured fun quests, original content, unique and interesting puzzles and tons of replay value. The sequel has none of these. Instead, quests are replaced with some of the most mind numbing goals imaginable. For instance, one of the VERY FIRST QUESTS you receive is simply this: ""Kill 1000 Gnomes"". Ahh, okaaay? That won't take you hours upon hours to do seeing as gnomes only pop up in groups of 2 or 3 at a time. This is fun!

Next is your minions, specifically controlling them. The control scheme in the first game was as close to perfection as it gets. It was solid, your minions did what you told them to do and so on. In O2, controlling your minions is an outright pain in the a$$. They don't move where you tell them to, they get hung up and caught on environmental objects, it takes several passes for them to pick up items and treasure that their already standing right on top of...it's a mess. Add in the fact that the camera fights you at every single turn and you're biggest challenge in this game isn't the enemies, or the bosses..it's your ""loyal servants"". Great job there.

Next is enemy AI, if you would even go so far as to call it that. You can literally stand right next to enemies and they won't even touch you. Ugh, how was this even considered for release when it has these kinds of problems.

The whole game feels half done. It isn't a worthy follow up, it's broken, buggy and glitchy. Are you a fan of the original? Then don't even look twice at this one. This is quite possibly the most disappointing sequel I have ever played.",0.034366625438054

1089,1.0,"With the end of World War 2, there were a number of escaped Nazis who fled the allies and escaped to the unknown. While many of them have been caught in the years since, some have remained at large, and I'm pretty sure that most of them have been continuing their campaign of pure evil by releasing this first person shooter abomination known as ""Wolfenstein"".

Wolfenstein tells the story of BJ, famed Nazi killer with ridiculous hair. Your mission, should you care to accept it (don't), is to infiltrate WW2 Germany and stop those wacky Nazis from dabbling in the occult to turn the tide of war in their favor. To accomplish your mission, you'll spend most of your time romping around a fictional German town filled with completely empty streets that the Nazis and resistance fighters fight to the death to occupy. It's one ugly town, making you wonder why the resistance wants to liberate it, as there's nothing there worth saving. Perhaps those dastardly Nazis are going to bulldoze the town to create the world's biggest Wal-mart.

While the world around you is not really worth saving, the bad guys inhabiting it will do their best to torment you. While the majority pose as much challenge as a damp washcloth, some will occasionally make you work for your kill, such as the heavy troopers. But unfortunately, Wolfenstein excels at creating some of the most flat out annoying enemies in the history of the universe. The assassins and mages are so freaking annoying, both in how they can screw you over in seconds, and with their irritating voices. If I have to hear another bald mage babble gibberish in a ridiculously deep voice, or hear another invisible assassin giggling and asking if I can see him, I'm going to scream. Leather clad nazimatrixses are just as bad, but they also have the annoying trait of sprinting up on you with no warning whatsoever, or in the case of a truly wretched boss fight in a hanger, summon multiple undead ghost skeletons (Save me John Freeman!) that are extremely difficult to kill. And those jetpack nazis with twin grenade launchers? You'll want to grab the guy who designed them and turn him into a smoldering skeleton with your Leichenfaust 44.

This is one of the game's biggest problems...the most powerful enemies will often come out of NOWHERE and literally stab you in the back, giving you no warning whatsoever. It is horribly common in the second half of the game to be jogging along and suddenly BAM, you're lying on the ground while a giggling assassin, nazimatrix, or flamethrower guy stands behind your dead corpse. You'll go through a completely empty hallway with no doors, rooms, or vents, and when you leave it, someone runs out behind you, blasting away with a high powered gun, giving you little to no chance to defend yourself. And when you try to fight back, it's not always easy. The mage, for example, can put shields around nearby soldiers, throw energy blasts at you, and run at superhuman speeds, making him frustratingly difficult to kill. In the game's absolute worst mission (which is optional THANK GOD), you have to defend a resistance soldier disabling a radio tower while dozens upon dozens of nazis swarm your position.  While the normal troops play fair, jetpack nazis frequently swarm you, and conveniently get out of range of your powerful mounted guns.  After surviving several waves (the resistance fighter sure takes his sweet friggin time), I was ecstatic upon hearing him say that he needed just a few more seconds...and then a nazimatrix ran out from NOWHERE and stabbed me in the back, killing me.  After a dozen or so tries, I just gave up.  The game feels like it's constantly cheating on you, and only gets worse in the later levels as you're bombarded by more and more powerful troops at every turn. I've never seen the words ""You are dead"" on my television screen so many times.

While your foes are a pain in the butt, your allies, regrettably, aren't any better. While they all come to adore you, 90% of them are too busy to talk to you, despite the fact that all they do is stand around, staring at nothing. The ones who do talk to you either send you on missions and stay behind to stare at tables and radios for hours on end, or actually come along to shoot at the Nazis and die. With the exception of Eric Engle, all of them are cardboard cutouts that you feel absolutely nothing for. Some characters, such as the leaders of the black market, are so useless that they could be cut out of the story completely without being missed. Same goes for the piece of cardboard leading the resistance and its radio operator, both of whom exist just to tell you things and nothing else.

Yet, all of these problems could be forgiven if the gameplay was compelling and enjoyable. But this is Wolfenstein's biggest flaw...with very few exceptions, it feels like we've played through all this before.  Many, many, many times before.  The shooting is average, even with the various upgrades you can earn. The levels, featuring war torn Europen cities, generic warehouses, burnt out churches, farms, underground caverns, endless sewers, bases, and airfields feels generic, with the levels and environments lacking any excitement or intrigue. The sole exception comes from the final two levels, which features the only real creativity and unique design, (But once again, infuriating enemies ruin the experience). You'll go through countless corridors and narrow streets, all filled with billions of empty wooden crates for you to smash. They're also filled with lots of gold lying about (its amazing how the Nazis left so many bags of gold lying all over the place) and intelligence reports that unlock various upgrades for your weapons. Hope you like playing hide and go seek, as you'll be spending hours on end hunting for these powerups.

So, is there anything good about Wolfenstein? Not much. The graphics are good, with lots of details and texturing. All the weapons are fun to use and none of them feel weak or useless, a very rare feat in this genre. Special mention must go to the Leichenfaust 44, which not only kills enemies, but turns them into smoldering skeletons. It's so brutally satisfying to have a nazimatrix or assassin run at you, only to blast their flesh off and watch their charred bones collapse to the ground. And they'll look good dying, because Wolfenstein has a very impressive physics engine. Hit crates and they'll bounce around in realistic fashion. Push a chair down the stairs and it'll bounce realistically all the way the bottom. At one point, while going through a library, I smashed two globes free of their holders and knocked them around like pin balls, and they reacted exactly as one would expect two giant globes to react when being knocked about. Aside from the guns and the physics, it's highly ironic that the greatest moment in the game is the ending cutscene...not only because it looks awesome (yet you wish you could play it instead of watching it), but it also signals that your agony is, at last, finally over.

From beginning to end, Wolfenstein is a colossal failure, and one of the worst video game I've ever played. The environments and levels are bland, the enemies will make you tear your hair out, and the story and characters are a joke. While other games have worse graphics, worse gameplay, and worse levels, Wolfenstein combines dozens of flaws to create video game junk. This is a game that looks pretty and has plenty of guns to shoot, but is boring, feels like it's cheating on you, and feels like every other generic WW2 shooter out there (and considering the supernatural element, that's saying a lot).  This game is ultimately just a waste of time in every aspect. I paid eight perfectly good dollars to rent this game, and I weep for every penny that I will never have again.

Avoid enlisting in this war at all costs. Go play any other game. Really, ANYTHING else. Bubsy 3D is a better then this. Superman 64 at least has unintentional humor at how awful it is. Wolfenstein is just bad. Better yet, take a cyanide pill and spare yourself the agony of any further sequels, as the ending strongly hints at one. To that, I yell, ""NEIN!""

The sound effects are horrible. The joke they call hand grenades are a very slow (limited distance) projected from an arm launcher rather then thrown and have little to no effect when they explode.
In Ghost I have a 2.0 kill to death ratio, However in this game I'm lucky to see another player before I'm killed five times (always from behind).
Because of the non dedicated server (still using the old host setup) you have lag induced by people who can't bother themselves with paying for a better internet connection.

UPDATE MARCH 4TH, 2012

This is the first time I do an update on a review and the reason it's very simple, the idea behind this product it's good, but the design it's just wrong, after checking the temperature on my PS3 after playing 5 hours straight using this product, it was boiling hot, the back of my PS3 was extremely hot, so I decided to unplugged the ""cooler"". On a different day I played for another 5 straight hours with out the cooler, and the PS3 was warm, not hot as the day before. On both occasions I've had the PS3 on top of a laptop cooler, and the entertainment center is open on the back and front, so there's a good flow of air. I guess this product would be better if it had larger and faster fans like the modifications on the picture.

So my recommendation it's to place the PS3 on top of a laptop cooler, this gives a good flow of air to the intakes on the PS3, and also have it in a well ventilated area. My first PS3, 80 gig fat, lasted almost four years, and I used it for everything, now this one I just use for video games., so it should last a while longer than the first.",0.06351309548108347

It's missing a lot of subtle but good stuff from the previous total war games, like being able to build more than one siege engine per turn (this is a big problem since every turn in a siege you suffer attrition), your spies are unable to open city gates, the option for units to either be defensive or aggressive, and ""fire at will"" option for javelin armed infantry like hillmen and legionnaires. There are also a lot of bugs. My archers that stood on the wall over the boiling oil died all at once...after the oil was pored.

To put it simply, you really gotten love godzilla to power through this grind. The monsters move like lumbering construction equipment with a huge  delay in their reaction times. Movement itself has been divided into three button mash up for no reason. The cities are empty and vold of people. There isn't even a destruction mode to take out your frustration. But the worst thing about this game however is that graphically, this had the potiential to be welcome refreash to the classic monster rampage genre. Music and sound effects were good too. The monsters have a great design and pay a great tribute to the movies but as far as being a depiction of what it would be like to rampage across a city, it fails pitifully from the very start.

1129,1.0,"My first experiences with SimCity as a franchise began with SimCity 4. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and played it for hours on end. When I heard a new SimCity was in the works I was thrilled. I immediately pre-ordered then subsequently bought it. Day 1 - 6 I could not log in to play the game due to EA's always-on DRM nonsense. That SHOULD have given me a clue what was to come...

By day 7 I was able to log in and begin playing with two friends of mine. We immediately noticed that when we bought a resource, electricity  for example, it would pay the person who was providing the resource but the person buying it would not have funds deducted. It was like the money was appearing from thin air. This, in our minds, compromised a real ""city simulation."" Strike one...

Traffic, oh sweet mercy, the traffic. Even after multiple attempts at different road layouts and millions sunk into mass transit we could  not prevent traffic from becoming an issue in every one of our cities. A domino effect ensued. Because traffic was bad firetrucks could not reach burning buildings, school buses had trouble picking up kids, garbage trucks couldn't pick up garbage, and so on. Mid to late game all of our cities were in chaos. It felt like an exercise in futility to build a city at all. Strike two...

Somehow, I managed to keep a city alive and well when I played single player. I had maybe logged 10 - 12 hours in this city before I encountered an error so many others have: ""Unable to load the city at this time. Please try again later."" Strike three, I'm out...

At time of this post SimCity is on version 1.8. With the current lack of improvement I have seen patch-by-patch it will be version 3.0 before SimCity is fully functional.

I later went to Walmart to pick up the traveling pouch instead. Sure, it isn't very pocket friendly, but if you're going to be throwing your  Vita (gently) into a backpack it's padded enough to give you peace of mind.

Now though, the internet connection bit is so angering for the game that this is supposed to be.

1133,1.0,"When the orginal Guitar Hero came out, that was one of the few games I really wanted for the PS2, which I did not have at the time. One of my friends got it, and I immediately fell in love. As a guitarist myself, I was really happy to see that people could play a rhythm-based game with rock music, as opposed to Dance Dance Revolution (which has primarily techno and dance music). Guitar Hero II came out first for the PS2, and later for the Xbox 360, with more songs, and downloadable content. With its added co-op and pro face-off two-player features, and an improved hammer-on/pull-off system, Guuitar Hero II is one of my favorite games on the 360. When it was announced that Neversoft was going to take Harmonix's place for the next Guitar Hero installment, I didn't know what to think. Screenshots for Guitar Hero 3 started circulating around the internet, I was both intrigued and disappointed. Intrigued by the new look and feel of the game, but disappointed that Neversoft was too stuck-up to keep the original design. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" must not be something heard around Neversoft's head honchos.
I have to say, playing GH3 for the first time, it was fun. As much fun as playing either of the other Guitar Hero games. That is, until I found what all was different. If you are allowed to either hammer-on or pull-off to the next note, you don't have to time it at all, which doesn't even make sense. One major problem I find with the game, is the fact that Neversoft decided that expert difficulty is going to be harder than anything else. How? By making any audible guitar noise a ""note,"" and the influx of three-note chords. Of course, that's the only way to make some of the songs challenging, seeing as every single song (except the battles) were singles at some point. Why is this bad? Because instead of choosing a song that would be good for Guitar Hero, a more popular song was chosen (specifically Miss Murder, Paint it Black, When You Were Young, and My Name is Jonas).
As for the guitar controller, Neversoft decided it would be for the best if the guitar had a detacheable neck. As for why, the only reason I can think of is for easy transport. But if you take the neck off, that's just one more thing to carry, and the neck doesn't stay in the body snugly, it jiggles around, ruining any long note you hit. The guitar I received has a jiggly neck, messed-up star power, and a slightly broken whammy bar. Star power is completely messed up. Sometimes it'll activate if I turn the guitar in any direction, and sometimes it won't activate unless I swing the guitar around like a maniac. Normally, I press the Back button, but even that doesn't work! As for the whammy bar, there's a ""dead spot"" in the middle position where it doesn't register, so I have to pump the whammy bar all the way down and all the way back for it to work.
Specifically for 360 owners, the achievements are ludicrous. They expect some kind of being with super-human Guitar Hero-playing powers to be playing GH3, because those are the only things that'll be getting the crazy achievements, such as beating Through the Fire and Flames on expert, using star power three times on TtFaF on expert, gold star (get 100 percent on) 20 songs on expert, and buying everything from the shop, which requires getting five stars on all songs on all four difficulties. Neversoft has completely ruined Guitar Hero for me, and I will be buying Rock Band 2 when it comes out instead of Guitar Hero: World Tour.

1136,1.0,"Don't let apologists for this game fool you, this game is awful and you deserve better. I've been a fan of survival horror since the first resident evil, I've played through all of them as well as most of the silent hill series. Mikami has a history with survival horror but this game is just horrible. I've played through the first two chapters and was near the end of the third when I couldn't take it anymore.

Here are the reasons you should avoid this game:

Aspect ratio- the screen has black bars and you lose 30% of your viewing space. Think about that, you can't use 30% of your television. The developer lies and says its for atmosphere and for a movie like feel. It's actually because they couldn't get the engine to run 1080p or even 900p. If you don't believe me read the digitalfoundry article on this game.

Graphics- honestly I thought I was playing a PS3 game, not a ps4. The textures are muddy and there is pop in everywhere. The character models look like something out of last gen. Except for the main character, apparently they spent all their time on him.

Performance- the game is supposed to be set at 30 fps, I'm actually okay with that however this game manages to drop frames and stutter when you are in open areas or with multiple enemies. Sadly it also occurs during cut scenes. It's ironic that the engine they use for this game is the same as for the new wolfenstein which runs at 1080p 60fps. This game is badly optimized garbage.

Sound- the sound quality is actually good and adds to the tension. The music seems to repeat a lot, and enemy moans are the same for most.

Gameplay- this is where the game truly sucks any joy you may have hoped to get. The controls feel like they have been dipped in molasses. The character controls are wonky and the button mapping for various functions are just awkward. The game also feels it necessary to give you the worst possible camera angle when you are trying to look around. Expect a lot of camera angles that get you killed while fighting bullet sponge bosses. Speaking of the enemies the AI is inconsistent at best. Sometimes enemies are oblivious to you standing next to them while other times they have a sixth sense to your presence.

Honestly I was very excited about this game however this left a bad taste in my mouth. If you want survival horror on your ps4 stick with outlast or the pt demo.  This game is no spiritual successor to resident evil 4, it's just a soulless awful wannabe.",-0.03488230791233701

1. About the reviewer and this review

Before I wrote this review, I discussed a large number of points I am making with other players. These points are also based on many comments I've read in SW TOR General Chat. This review is the aggregate experience of many players.

I decided to write this detailed review so that you can decide if you should buy this game and pay monthly fees to play it.

I have been a gamer for 22 years since I purchased my fist computer in 1990. Since then, I have played just about every half-decent PC game that has been released to date and still own approximately 1,000 titles.

Depending on the genre and the developer, games have to be graded/rated differently: While some things may be forgivable in the case of a rookie developer, such forgiveness is hardly appropriate in the case of such company as BioWare.

Additionally, while some features (such as outfits) haven't much significance in a single-player First Person Shooter (Far Cry, for example) they are hugely important in an MMO game where social aspects of game play are essential for multiplayer experience. That said, I will rate SW TOR based on the below criteria, all equally important (skip to the end of the review to see scores):

a. Graphics
b. Coding/Game engine
c. User Interface (UI)
d. Combat system
e. Skill System
f. Social interaction system
g. Quest design and quality (including Flashpoints and Space missions)
h. Companions

2. What makes a game great

There is only one major thing that makes a game great - Excitement.

A truly great game (regardless of the genre) excites you so that you are unable to put it down. You think about it even when you are not playing it. Many hours pass by and you are unable to exit it, you keep wanting more - just one more turn, let me finish this mission and then I will go to bed, just one more level, and then I am done for today... But with a great game these things are wishful thinking. This never happens with a truly great game - you go to bed when your head hits the keyboard or your spouse or parents force you to quit or your girlfriend threatens to dump you. A great game will come to you in your dreams at night and may cause you to wake up and fire up your gaming rig and you don't care if your girlfriend walks out on you anymore (this actually happened to a friend of mine when he was playing the venerable Baldur's Gate 2). Additionally, a great game is essentially bug-free.

SW TOR does not meet such expectations. It is dull, it fails to captivate, it is badly designed, lacks essential features and it is buggy.

3. SW TOR bottom line verdict

AVERAGE TOTAL SCORE: 32.2% out of 100% (skip to the end of the review to see the calculation)

- Who may enjoy this game:
Younger players with little gaming experience who lack a meaningful basis for comparison, Star Wars fans who simply must have everything and anything related to Star Wars.

- Who is likely to be disappointed:
Experienced players with solid MMO RPG experience and those who remember the great games of the past such as Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 2, and more recently Neverwinter Nights and Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR), not to mention World of Warcraft.

SW TOR is not the game it has been advertised to be, it is hardly an MMO game in the first place (more about this later in Social Interaction and Quest Design). Fundamentally, this is a single-player RPG with some rudimentary (and generally badly executed) elements of an MMO. A lot of design decisions in SW TOR feel like they were made by people who have no idea of what gaming is about; it is as if they visualized some idea and thought it was a good one without trying to see whether it works in the real world as opposed to their imagination (see detailed explanations below).

4. The good

SW TOR is playable and generally has pleasing graphics and character models (minus some glitches). Some of it is fun. The game does not have any gargantuan crippling bugs and does not crash (though some reviewers complain that it does crash in many Flashpoint instances). Talking NPC quest givers are okay (when they actually animate and say something interesting - more on this below).

5. The bad

SW TOR is infested with small bugs (see below). None of these bugs taken in isolation is a deal-breaker but taken together they will seriously detract from your enjoyment (especially if you are a World of Warcraft veteran or simply like it when things make sense).

Using an analogy, imagine that you are planning to buy a 10 million-dollar penthouse apartment complete with a swimming pool, sauna, bar, a rooftop garden, gym and wine cellar, etc. (let your imagination run wild). You come to see the place and you love it but then you notice roaches and other bugs everywhere. In the real world, you could call the exterminator and get rid of all these bugs, but with SW TOR you cannot do that, you have to live with the bugs. So ask yourself - would you still buy that penthouse if you had no ability to get rid of the bugs? Would you learn to live with them for that price? It is possible that over time BioWare will fix some or most of these bugs but as it stands now, the game is a BETA and should not have been released in its current sorry state. Players who already subscribe to it should demand months of free play until the bugs are eradicated. Those who have not bought the game yet should not buy it for the next six months to a year (if ever).

i. Bugs

Here's a short list of the most common and very noticeable bugs with descriptions (and I do mean that this list does not include ALL the bugs). The bugs are listed as they come to mind, not necessarily in the order of importance:

- Companion health bar is glitched. Character status will display full companion health while their health bar shows they are injured. This is bad if you waste resources on healing them in combat when they do not need to be healed not to mention that you don't know what is telling the truth - the number in status display or the health bar itself;

- Item preview window is not centered on the screen (nor is it movable, just like all the rest of the UI windows); It gets in the way if you have it and Character sheet open at the same time - it blocks part of the Character sheet (this is just sloppy design not to mention that it would be preferable if you could see item stat benefits in your Character sheet and see what the item looks like on you at the same time);

- Resource gathering nodes often appear on the mini-map and world map but are invisible or non-interactive in the game world. BioWare claims to have fixed this bug in one of the patches deployed last week but this is not true - this bug still exists in many areas to the point that some areas on Nar Shaddaa, for example, haven't a single resource node that you are able to interact with. It is a pain in the neck to fight through a horde of enemies just to find out that you cannot harvest the resource you were going for;

- Sometimes faces/bodies of NPCs and your character do not animate in conversations and sometimes an NPC may be replaced by a blank spot. You hear characters talk, but nothing is animated. You may be looking at a chair where an NPC quest giver should be sitting but the chair is empty;

- Some areas on the world map permanently show the 'fog of war' and appear unexplored even if you have explored every last inch of the area. It is especially frustrating when this happens on the very first planet you come to visit after completing the starting area;

- Some attack skills appear to be causing no damage to the enemies or otherwise don't work as advertised (for example Scoundrel's Blaster Volley);

- Camera zoom feature reminds me of a DSLR camera with a bad case of autofocus disease, which does not know if it's coming or going: Very often, you roll your mouse wheel just one notch/click and the camera zooms out to the maximum (or to the minimum) distance. Should you manage to get the zoom right where you want it, magnification will not stay fixed - the camera will zoom in or out without any input from you depending on where you are in the game world. This is supposed to be automatic camera zoom optimization, but trust me, it will make your head spin after a while. Moreover, since the camera is adjusting all the time, interacting with static objects (such as clicking a chest to loot it) is difficult: A lot of times you will have to try to click more than once to get it right;

- Looting is bugged on many levels. There is no click-to move in this game and you cannot click on a chest to move to it and open it. You need to manually WSAD your character to the chest (or another interactive object) and click on it. When you do, one of three things will happen - either you will get a message that you are Out of Range (though it does not look like it to you) and you have to WSAD again to get in range, OR just as you click the map zoom adjusts and you miss-click and have to try again, OR your companion will get in front of you and block the object and you end up clicking on your companion who then comes back at you saying something like - ""Really? You have some weird ideas about fun"" (or something like that), so then you need to WSAD to get your companion out of the way, but be careful not to get Out of Range in the process. See what I mean? What should require a single click takes two dozen clicks and some careful WSADing in this game (more on how bad it is in combat, see below);

- Sometimes companions get stuck due to path-finding bugs. When they do, you cannot harvest any resources because for some silly reason if your companion is with you they must stand next to you for the resource to be harvestable; If your companion is dead you cannot harvest either. The only thing you can do here is either resurrect or dismiss your companion, then harvesting becomes possible;

- Item crafting menus often tell you that you can make 0 (zero) items of some kind while you know for a fact that you have enough materials to make 10 of that item;

- Item comparison tool-tips are wrong half the time: They may show that an item is an upgrade (in terms of stats) while it is, in fact, a downgrade. One example (of many) I noticed that comparing two identical items I crafted myself - one worn on my character and the other in my inventory showed that one of the items was a downgrade of the other while the two items are identical;

- Tool-tips do not update correctly if you modify/upgrade an item in your inventory unless you close and re-open the inventory window or move the item to another slot in the inventory;

- The game is full of various inconsistencies. For example, if a companion stands next to you and you send him on a mission he disappears (as he should since he is gone on a mission on another planet). However, if you are on your ship and send, say, C2-N2 droid on a mission it will continue to stand in its usual place making annoying comments about your diet, for example;

- If you are on a ship and are landing on a planet you can hit ESC to skip the landing cinematic, but if you are taking off from a planet, hitting ESC will not skip the take-off cinematic; instead it will throw you out of the ship back into the Hangar Bay, so like it or not you will watch the same take-off cinematic over and over and over again;
- If you are on a space mission (all of which include some space combat; more on Space mission design, see below) your crew/companions will say things which are completely out of place and make no sense whatsoever (again, this is just sloppy on BioWare's part). For example, you begin a mission, there are no enemies nearby yet, there is no damage to your ship and suddenly, in a panicky voice, your companion will shout: ""The engines can't take it!"" Another example, say your shaolin clicking results in a total destruction of an oncoming wave of 10 enemy fighters and you also manage to vaporize a few turrets on a nearby enemy destroyer and your companion will yell (again, in a panicky voice): ""Are you asleep or what? Hit something! Hit anything!"" And so on and so forth;

- Sometimes item tool-tips in your inventory will be partly off the screen, especially if you are trying to open a box or a briefcase located at the far right or far left slot of the inventory window, depending on the position of this window;

- There is a good number of graphical glitches such as clothes/armor tearing;

- Sometimes taxis that take you to different areas on planets will appear to be lost, hit a wall, then reverse 180 degrees, as if they are having path-finding issues while they should be traveling along predetermined routes - this happens even on the very first planet you get to visit;

- Sometimes the group conversation window will get stuck on your screen and you will be unable to close it - this caused my party to wipe out a few times when I could not see what I was attacking since closing it would require that I log off/on and risk losing membership in the party (more on ugly party/grouping design, see below);

- Sometimes your attack skill graphics will be stuck somewhere in the game world and continue to be active/animated as if you are still casting even if you die. I recall Telekinetic Throw doing that even after I died, resurrected, killed the boss and moved on, but the spell I had cast before dying just kept going and going...

- There is a good number of typos, grammar and spelling errors in Help/Lore Codex/NPC conversations; I am sure you can find typos in my review but I am not selling it and I have not painstakingly proofread it. When BioWare praises its uber-talented writers such things cannot be allowed or forgiven.

- Companions have the hardest time getting on the elevators/elevator platforms with you to the point that sometimes if the elevator shaft is deep enough and takes you far enough away from your companion you will get a message that your companion was defeated (dead) and the only way to get them back is to ride back up/down, resurrect them (since you cannot dismiss a dead companion), then dismiss them, get on the elevator, reach your destination and then re-summon your companion;

- There are some useless things in the game world left over from BETA which serve no useful purpose but confuse you into thinking that they do, for example Enhancement Stations;

- There are plenty more bugs but the above should be enough for you to decide if such things will enhance or ruin your gaming experience.

ii. Design

SW TOR is not the first, nor is it even ONE of the first games of this kind (MMO RPGs). As a matter of fact, it is probably the last! One would think that BioWare should have painstakingly examined, analyzed and overanalyzed existing MMO RPGs and built on their experience to create something revolutionary, game-changing, impressive or at least just as good. Well, if you thought that you are in for a disappointment.

The game is full of counterintuitive, clumsy, non-ergonomic, nearly dysfunctional design features which are not bugs per se but were designed sloppily and thoughtlessly and were included in the game intentionally. Here is a short, not all-inclusive list of such bad design decisions (which most likely will not be changed by BioWare because they are not exactly bugs).

- Chat: When you play a game like this you usually look at the center and upper part of your screen, but Chat window here is placed at the top of the screen, obscuring the game world. You CAN minimize the Chat window but then you will never know if someone whispers to you since the audible notification seems partly bugged, but mostly it is barely audible and if you are in combat you will never hear it. This certainly gets in the way of multiplayer activities;

- This is an instanced world (somewhat like Guild Wars). So if there are not too many players in your ""phase"" you can travel for long stretches of time without encountering any players in the game world;

- The game world is largely dead - there are few (if any) critters and I have yet to see a bird (even in a green, wooded area), but more annoying than that, more than half of animals I've seen appear to be nailed in place - you can run up and down the same road doing quests and the animals will just continue to stand in the same exact positions and never take a single step (granted, some animals move a little bit in some areas);

- Mail messages are limited to very few words which makes Role-Playing letters hard to write (thankfully, they finally fixed the bug where you could not even send a text-only letter without including money or items);

- Mini-map/Compass is stationary with the top always pointing to the north which is counterintuitive when you are moving one way but on the mini-map it looks like you are moving the opposite way. This complicates orientation and forces you to constantly bring up the World Map;

- There are plenty of bars/cantinas and other social areas with chairs, couches, bar stools and other objects on which you could potentially sit, but you can't. The only place where you can sit on chairs is your ship. Again bad for Social interaction and Role-Playing;

- You can teleport (Fast Travel) to many locations, but you cannot Fast Travel to your ship (which serves as your home);

- You cannot receive mail on your ship, though it is your home;

- The game includes a wide range of emotes such as /laugh /giggle, etc. But all emotes are mute (silent). When you /laugh, for example, your character animates but since there is no sound of any kind the animation almost looks like your character is having a heart attack;

- Main UI windows cannot be moved by the player which is counterintuitive because sometimes your Inventory (or character sheet, or whatever) will open on the left side of the screen or on the right side of the screen, depending on whether any other windows are open. This is just non-ergonomic. Windows should be movable/resizable and should remember their last position - this is the 21st century for crying out loud. Even Guild Wars has that! This way, when you open UI windows, they always open in the same place making it far easier on you;

- There is no UI scaling. Enough said;

- Galactic Trade (Auction House) interface is barely usable: Firstly, you cannot use keyword search without first selecting a few required item classification filters, and even then you can type a keyword, such as Mullinine (a metal used for crafting), and the search results will produce auctions for EVERY similar metal. However, you cannot sort the window to display only what you need - Mullinine. If there is a way, it is obscure enough that I could not find it. With only 10 search results per page and some 20 pages of metals auctions, good luck finding the best price for Mullinine, this is just one example;

- You cannot link items in the auctions to find what you are trying to buy or sell easily, etc.

- The same inconvenience exists when trying to add friends. There is no easy way to do it. What should take two clicks takes 5+. You cannot link a character's name into the Add Friend dialogue field, you have to type the name manually, and we all know how strange some names can be so be prepared to misspell and get ""Player does not exist"".

 Additionally, you cannot add to friends those characters which are not presently logged on, so if you meet someone you like, it is not enough to ask them for the names of their Alts - that player has to log off and come back with each Alt so you can add them to friends and you will have to do the same for him/her. Now think about it: You play 4 characters and your new friend plays 4 characters. You want each of your characters to have each of his four characters on their Friends' List and he wants each of your 4 characters on the list of each of his 4 characters so you can always find each other. Do the math. It will take you several hours to achieve this. Again, was this design concocted by a gamer with the gamers' convenience in mind? I would have to say NO WAY;

- Grouping for quests and getting together is incredibly dysfunctional and I am not talking about ""Looking for Group"" feature which, naturally, may take a while to find a PUG. I am talking about a group of friends trying to get together for a hard quest.

Here's how it goes: Say you form a party with three friends, but they are on different planets. There is no way whatsoever to summon them. Instead, they have to run to the Space Port on their planets, fly their ship to the quest planet. Then, you may be all in different phases on the same planet, so you need to change the phase to make sure you are all in the same phase; and this WILL happen to you: You may think you are fast and smart and quickly change to your friend's phase but he is just as fast and switches to YOUR phase, so you are in different phases again. Now you have a 5-minute cooldown before you can switch phases again. But this is not all. Then, you all have to run to the quest area which in itself may take a while. On a number of occasions the following happened to me: It took approximately 40-45 minutes just to get together and at that point one or two members of the party had to log off, which brought us back to square on, so we decided to abandon the quest we wanted to do for fear of trying to get together with another party for another 40-45 minutes;

- Speaking of cooldowns... Combat and skill mechanics in this game are some of the worst a player can imagine. Combat and skill use is the definition of ""tedious"". Someone should tell BioWare that ""tedious"" is the opposite of ""fun"".

Activation of most of the skills depends on the use of other skills or changing stances/forms or both, so when you are in combat you are not looking at the epic lightsaber swinging - you are staring non-stop at your skills toolbar waiting for something to become clickable.

Moreover, there is no auto-attack in this game which means that to execute even your lowliest level 1 attack which does not cost any resources to use, you have to keep clicking that button until it breaks or your finger falls off - it is like BioWare wants to help peripherals manufacturers sell more mice and keyboards. This is especially frustrating in the case of classes which have no usable resource such as mana or energy or focus (or what have you) and which entirely depend on charge-up attacks before they build enough charges to be able to use more advanced attacks/skills.

Additionally, the cooldowns are horrendously long. Not only use of any skill triggers its own cooldown, it also triggers a global cooldown which is approximately 2 seconds long, so good luck trying to place your skill icons in an efficient and intuitive way.

So, use of combat skills depends on

- Use of other skills
- Stance/form
- Skill cooldown
- Prerequisite skill cooldown
- Global cooldown
- Whether you are in range of the target or not (have to manually WSAD into range which always involves trial and error)
- Your character's orientation relative to the intended target.

What does this mean? It means that combat is INCREDIBLY, UNBELIEVABLY TEDIOUS. And half the time while you are struggling with the above skill use variables your companion has already killed everything. Often times you target an enemy but your attack fails because the enemy is already dead (killed by your companion) which does not show on your screen for the next couple of seconds when the enemy finally falls down. BUT sometimes they don't even fall down, instead they continue to stand there but are no longer targetable;

- Social in this game is artificially forced on the player. Some NPC conversations feel forced and unnatural. If the above does not convince you, then read this: A lot of cool-looking items which would be great to have for social gatherings and role-playing require that you gain (a lot of) social points. The only way to do it is... to group with other people and participate in group conversations while doing group quests. So if you want to do RP and take part in social affairs you are forced to do dungeon crawling for social points.

- There is no gray area between Light and Dark side. While it may be reasonable for a Jedi to be leaning toward Light or Dark, it makes no sense that a Smuggler, who could be neutral pretty much by definition, must choose Light or Dark. Why is this important? Because there are Light Side item vendors and Dark Side item vendors, but nothing for the neutral Smuggler. This artificial and nonsensical limitation is very bad for role-players;

- This game seems to be immune to Antialiasing - even setting AA in global settings for your video card will have no impact on how things look in the game: Even at resolutions as high as 1920 x 1200 with every graphics option at the highest setting you will see jaggies on your character model;

- Quests! This game was supposed to revolutionize questing. It did not. There are essentially three categories of quests and every single quest within a specific category is identical to the rest of them.

""Please help!"" quests:

It does not matter what the talking NPCs say. Every ""Please help!"" quest follows precisely the same template. Even conversations are all the same. Yes, different words will be used but the meaning is always the same: We are in trouble, but we are afraid (or can't afford) to go there. You are tough and skilled, so help us. And you always have three identical options: - Yes! - Maybe (as in ""What's in it for me?"") and - No. Then you go and you kill that and recover the item(s) and return to the quest giver.

By the way, it makes sense that you need to return to the quest giver if you must deliver items; but half of the quests involve no items. Even today everyone has a cell phone. Why can't you just call them on a holocron to report your success? Why do you have to run back to them? There is incredible amount of back-and-forth running in this game...

""Fetch"" quests :

Go kill X of that or find Y of the other. Enough said.

""Character class quests"":

Now, these are supposed to offer completely unique and immersive experience, but they don't. Once you did one character class quest you can try another class's quest but it will follow exactly the same template as the one you've done:

Some bad guy does something bad, you go find out what's happening, the bad guy is gone but you find a clue; you follow the clue, you go someplace else, but the bad guy is, of course, gone again. He taunts you over a holographic communicator. He says he is impressed with you but now you die. You say, ""No YOU die, prick! Come and face me, you coward!"" Then he hangs up, a bunch of mobs + a boss jump you. Sometimes you die as the bad guy predicted and you feel like a schmuck for being so brave in the conversation before. You resurrect, you kill the bad guys and move on to the next clue. Of course, the bad guy is again a step ahead of you and you come back empty-handed but with another clue. Finally, you find some end-chapter boss. He says: ""Now you die."" You say, ""No YOU die."" Above scenario repeats. This is the end of character quest Chapter 1. Now Chapter 2 begins on another planet but you will do exactly the same sequence of steps as in Chapter 1.

The tooted speaking NPCs/Quest givers become an annoyance at some point and you can't hit spacebar fast enough to skip the never-ending, redundant conversations to get to the point and just accept the quest already.

Moreover, some conversations end with two answer choices: One that gives you Light Side points and the other - Dark. More than once you will encounter a situation where your final answer choice completely reverses the tone and the meaning of the entire conversation depending on which points you are trying to accumulate, and you will go ""What the xxxx""?

""Flashpoints"" (group story-based quests) don't fare much better. The very first such quest on the transport ship the Esseles is likely to make you go ""What the xxxx?""

At some point in the story the Ambassador who is the cause of all the trouble will suggest that you vent the Engineering section spacing all the innocent people there to gain a tactical advantage. Let's say you choose not to do it but you can't help feeling that she is a cruel, unworthy person.

Then, she joins you on a mission to board the enemy ship at which point the captain of the Esseles runs up to you and says that she is evil and that for as long as she is aboard the Esseles it will continue to be the target for the enemy who attacked the Esseles to get their hands in the Ambassador, so you should just leave her behind on the enemy ship. You think to yourself - yes, this evil creature deserves what's coming to her and decide to leave her behind, as the captain asked. Now, say you DO leave her behind on the enemy ship AGAINST her will. Guess what happens next? The captain proclaims her a hero and her 'sacrifice' a noble one and an example that will inspire future generations. How do you like this garbage? How can one stay immersed and impressed by all the talking NPCs and story-based quests when such nonsensical outcomes happen on the very first Flashpoint mission which is supposed to be perfect and get you excited about doing these quests going forward?

- Space combat. Essentially, you have no control over your ship - it always flies on some manner of autopilot. Each space mission is on a timer (something like 5 minutes). Say you are quick and destroy all assigned targets in 2 minutes but you cannot leave the mission - your ship will continue flying around on autopilot until the timer runs out;

iii. Unfortunate feature omissions

- No click to move/activate
- No auto-attack
- No summoning of party members, no meeting stones or equivalent
- No usable keyword search in Auctions
- No easily obtainable Social items such as outfits, foods, etc.
- No customizable or scalable UI
- No audible emotes
- Others, but the above are essential for a game of this kind.

AVERAGE TOTAL SCORE: 32.2% out of 100%

This game is an unfinished product which was likely rushed to the market by EA (the publisher) in time for Christmas shopping which happened (I would hope) against the backdrop of BioWare's adamant objections. I don't think anyone would buy a largely usable (new) car which lacks body paint, windshield wipers and whose MP3 player is not working right. Should you buy this game and subscribe to play it?

1151,1.0,"Worst game yet I had the chance to play.
Ok for those of you that have played previous similar games to this one and are hardcore with the story line go head and waste your $$ on this useless game. Here is where I am coming from so hear me out.
I played games on all systems in my life including owning both Xbox one and Ps4 so when I decided to buy this game today from Costco, I thought..... Amazon had great reviews on this game including Great Graphics and Story line and told myself I like fantasy games playing Destiny was fun but short so this game should be kind of Lord of the rings movie with Elfs and Archers etc.

I bought it for Xbox one by the way.

For all of you liars that said this had great Graphics you need to see your eye doctor, this game so far has to have the worst graphics yet for Nex Gen systems its like playing Computer games from the 90s with a hdmi cable to buffer things up.

The Characters: What a Joke!! Every single character looked like they went to Bosley to get their hair implants, nothing looked natural except for the sweat on their face. The movements are not smooth, the items that they were are so fake looking example: a necklace that one of the archer wears not only it looks like someone forgot to give it some 3d look to it, as the dude moves it doesn't move on him making it look even more ridiculous it looks like he is wearing some paper necklace, now i could care less he is wearing that its to show they did not designed things right.

The Landscape: Once again people from before, Liars!!! I seen Better landscape on Forza 5, CoD Ghost, Cod MW, Need For Speed, Destiny and the list can go on and on.... The land scape on this game is like play Ps3 or Xbox 360 and yes I own those too.

Story-line: Not impressed its the same crap thats been done over and over again, you kill Sorcerers and Monsters just like in Destiny and tons of other games like Castilvania and so forth and its so cool you get to choose the crap that comes out of the characters mouth just like back then with Nintendo, and this was one of the positive feedback on Amazon so this excites you people...... wow very sad to hear that.

Said all this its not even worth to continue with the bashing I played the game for 1hr and I will get rid of it worst 57.00 dollars spent yet I would have gladly give that money to a starving kid than give it to this company.",-0.011520649449711238

1153,1.0,"Some people might have been interested in this game at first. It's a remastered edition of Saints Row IV with 1080p resolution and a few enhancements. While the enhancements aren't really anything to bark about, the game itself is of Volition's usual ""good job"".

""Good Job"": Now, when I use these words, it isn't in a way to give positive reinforcement to the developers. Anyone who has played Saints Row IV last generation might remember the problems that the game suffered during it's early days. It took months for them to release the patches to get the get up to par. The same is unfortunately true in this generation of Saints Row IV. I mean, the matchmaking is something in this generation that I suspect to be broken. I couldn't even get it to work, to connect with ONE person. The game also crashes, it's happened to me atleast two times in one day.

The Good Side: What to expect out of the Re-Elected version? Every piece of DLC that was released on the PS3 plus the game Gat out of Hell.

Gate out of Hell: You've heard my complaints about the Re-Elected version of Saints Row IV. Now comes my thoughts on Gat out of Hell. It has a nice premise, but frankly speaking, this should have been the new Saints Row of the generation. Make it longer and give people the chance to stomp on the minions of Hell as Johnny Gat, yes please. But I found it a bit too dark visually.

Conclusion: If you don't mind a pure single player experience, then this is the bundle for you. If you want to buy SR4 individually, PSN has it for 30.00 or so. But it's from Volition, who are the worst developers that I've seen.",-0.024035087719298243
1154,1.0,"I loved the earlier games, they were ahead of their time and really pushed not only the RPG genera forward but gaming as a whole. However this watered down garbage is not worth anyone's time let alone the obscene 60$ price tag. The story is basically a badly framed 'last time on Diablo' recap that fails to engage the player or attempts to actually break new ground.  Literally the story is tacked on it feels like an afterthought.  The randomly generated dungeons are absent (short of the possibility to launch 'events' which are short random fights) leaving you to slog through the exact same content over and over again.

1157,1.0,"i almost had to do a double take with the opinions i saw for this game. i don't know what these other people saw, but i saw a game that had amazing hype around it and fell way short of expectations. the graphics looked to be amazing, especially in the cut scenes, but the graphics in game play were some of the worst i have ever seen. i actually thought there was something wrong with the game disc when the actual game play started. it looked like something that was slapped together with blatant disregard for texturing and realism. the in game graphics were so unpolished that i felt cheated. they were unbelievably bad. with a system as powerful as the PS3, this is a deal breaker for any serious gamer. it's just unacceptable.

game play wise, the force feedback for the game is some of the best i have ever seen. the combat was repetitive but very impactful and enjoyable. the story line was nonexistent but you don't really care about that in a hack and slash game. the comparisons of this game to god of war III are completely unfounded, the in game graphics for dante's inferno doomed it from the start. once i finished the game, which was hard to do because it was such an eye sore, i just gave it away to a friend who popped it in his PS3, played for five minutes, then shelved it. it's still sitting there last time i went over to his house. the scenery's in the game are very unique, but unique doesn't trump quality. i don't care if a game has revolutionary scenery with it's level design, if it looks like garbage graphics wise, then it's not worth mentioning. it's just not worth playing when the game is designed for 3rd generation consoles and looks that bad.",-0.053700977385187906

With the Ultimate edition I was playing through all the extra missions before the last couple segments of the main missions.  There is plenty to explore and do inside this world, inside these several worlds actually, as a couple of the DLC areas have a rather different feel to them.  HOWEVER I'm playing on a PS3, and with just a few side missions remaining before getting ready to complete the main storyline I reached a point where the game predictably hangs just a few seconds after loading my save (about 11MB).

For most of the time I spend with this game a save/reload sequence generally resulted in 30min-1hr of play time (seems like less than that when travelling with a companion, which really sucked because companions are fun, and unlock a number of other side missions).

1165,1.0,"Ill skip over a lot of what's been said and try to keep this short and concise.

I truly felt this game was an utterly pointless sequel to a franchise that has been going steadily downhill for years now. It adds nothing new, nothing interesting or fresh to the series at all. It is basically just resident evil 5 all over again, only it somehow feels more stale, less interesting and less like resident evil. Its action based over scare based. They removed over the years any sense of terror or suspense instead going with the modern day version of horror being loud noises and stuff jumping out like it's a carnival spook house.

The game literally feels like a 3rd person version of house of the dead where you basically move from linear corridor to linear corridor where monsters popup and you shoot them, that's it. A lot of times you'll stand there and there is obviously nothing at all in front of you, then lighting flashes and suddenly there is a zombie there. You're walking along and they slide out of dir ducts, popup out of the ground or a body just laying there leaps out at you when you get close. And the worst part about that is its all so predictable, you can see everything long before it happens.

The story (I won't go into details and spoil anything) is horribly bad and needless. It feels so forced that it's just plain awful. It's an obvious poorly conceived notion put in place just to make another sequel and nothing else. It has no originality, nothing that actually adds to the resident evil mythos, nothing is explained that needs to be explained. And the characters are either ones from previous games used purely because they are recognizable or new ones added that haven't the slightest shred of originality to them or intrigue and are basically just cookie cutter characters that are very two dimensional. Everything also happens so fast and with no logical or even reasonable reason I can't get into it. ""Oh no I'm trapped, wait this stranger says a bus is coming to save us, and look here it is, now were driving down the road and crash"". That's essentially how the entire game goes along. It's like each section and each scene in the game are broken up with no fluidity between them. If you ever heard an 11 year old kid try to tell you about something that happened to him when he is all excited that's what resident evil 6's story is like. Or ""Hey look a woman in a white cocktail dress is laying in this bottomless cavern that has been sealed for decades we had to open ourselves with no one or nothing else around. Oh its my sister, quick we have to help her"".

The quick time events are back and worse than ever. You are constantly waggling a stick, button mashing, pushing button combos or whatever for no reason at all. Even something as stupid as during a cut scene you're getting away in a car and during the scene you have to push a button to make the car move. You don't steer, you don't drive, you don't do anything because you're not controlling anything but it still makes you push a button, just one button just so the cut scene will continue.

The combat is awful. It's basically just like gears of war, only with less polish and it's harder to use because it's so clunky. You're body takes up too much of the screen, especially when backed against a wall. The shooting feels stiff. Trying to hit something that is close but not directly in front of you is a pain. Just all in all the combat is horrible and I don't know how many times I died simply because moving around and shooting were so sluggish and poorly designed. And the cover system is awful since it will switch your perspectives, stick you to walls you don't want to be on, move the camera to a position you cant see anything, if an enemy gets in too close it is hard to get off the wall to fight them and so on.

I can't recommend this game at more than 10 dollars and even then I'd just say ""if you played resident evil 4 and 5 then you played this already"". I paid 20 and I feel like I wasted my time and money on it.",-0.040029264574355586

To all future buyers of this game, if you have the SNES version and are looking for an enhanced graphics and whatnot on the Wii, you will be disappointed.  The reason why I mentioned the virtual console is that I recognized the opponent in the accompaing screen shot when a user is about to use whatever Wii points he or she has.

1184,1.0,"I loved the original Bomberman games. It was a great strategy game - you had to set up bomb patterns to blow out walls and destroy enemies. Then came the XBox 360 version.

I was really looking forward to a fun, engrossing strategy game that I could play for hours on end. I don't mind ""dark"" games so choosing between a male and female somber, realistic looking robot didn't bother me much. You can choose from a few colors to ""highlight"" their metallic outfits as well. Then you head onto the playing grid.

Suddenly the game is far less fun. I realize it's about grids, it's about thinking out your moves since you can only move at a certain speed. You have to try to lure your opponent into a trapped location so that you can blast them into oblivion. However, because of the camera angles, the unnecessary excess graphic items and the darkness, it tries to seem more like a first person shooter. The slow pace of your character, instead of being a normal part of the strategy, now seems unnecessary and annoying. You can't always see what you're trying to do.

Maybe the sound could have been the saving grace - but if anything, it makes the game far, far worse. The incredibly tinny, robotic voice that gives you a status at the end of each level is perhaps the most annoying voice I have ever heard in a game. It almost makes you want to deliberately lose, so you don't have to hear the winning commentary.

The irony is that usually we only buy games we really expect to want to play and replay. We rent the rest so that we can review them thoroughly, play through once, and then send the game back again. We thought this would be a keeper - we were told it'd be a lot of fun - but as it turns out we had to force ourselves to play it.

If you're a fan of the Bomberman series, then there are numerous games from before the XBox 360 which are great fun to play and replay.  Get your hands on those, enjoy them for the fun puzzle worlds they provide, and avoid this misguided latest version.

I know that some reviewers have said that EA has fixed their online problems; unfortunately this is not entirely true, depending on what you feel that the online problems are. Some of the freezing issues have been eradicated, but the overall interface is typical EA - worthless at best.

I am a mature gamer (30+) and regularly play with a group of friends, it is next to impossible to get them all into one game, and once you do, you inevitably get a bunch of screaming kids, racists, etc because EA didn't have the foresight to add a ""friend only"" option?!?!?!

Perhaps I have just been spoiled with Halo 2's party/lobby system, I don't know what is wrong with EA, but they insist on managing the online portion of their gaming. Have they not proved it time and time again that their Live interface is one of the worst in online gaming? In one corner, you have Bungie with a tried and true menu/lobby/game selection UI... and on the other side, you have the mess that EA passes off as UI. So why do it? Is it because they don't want their XBL corporate identity to be linked as a little sibling of Bungie, or a copycat? They need to get over it, the comparison is still being made, only in a MUCH more unfriendly light.

If you are new to the hack 'n slash genre, I could see this being a fun game.  It just does not compare, the game slows down a lot (even with the bad graphics), only has 3 characters and the moves are just OK... not enough variety.

When I think about Dynasty warriors and how much variety it has, this game really is just trying to pull the 'sex sells' act and spend a month throwing together a game and put 'bikini' in the title because they know it cannot compete with it's peers.

The game can be fun if you haven't experienced others in its genre.  But it is short, the game has little replay value with only 3 characters (compared to near 100 in some games), and overall any comparison you make to any other recent game in the genre is basically terrible.

fills most of one screen. The grid navigation and number entry system are very intuitive. The only issue is there are a set number of puzzles.

I wish the designers of Brain Age would put out a dedicated sudoku game with the same interface, but one that generates new puzzles.

The packaging for $139 is mostly cheap plastic, not a cool box like I'm used to from Razer.  The mouse is neat.  Feels a little big but I imagine that's to do with all the buttons on the side.

Where you run into the problem is when you update and load the software.  Then you CANNOT save your setup.  The LED can be changed to any color you'd like, but every time you exit that program or reboot, its back to default.  What is the point of having a mouse with configurable buttons and no ability to save your setup?

You've got all those buttons but no matter how you program them they will just go back to default.

Their website is atrocius for trying to find a fix.  It looks cool (but the faction insignia is always yellow so it doesn't match the mouse wheel), and might be good, but since they apparently don't beta test their firmware upgrades, its a nice doorstop.  I'll just stick with my logitech which is smaller and cheaper.

Why I won't be returning it is because of the 2 per character exclusive green-black color crystals.  So they got my money and will keep it.

So I gave it 1 out of 5 since it's non-functional as a programable mouse.  But its Star Wars and it looks cool.

Another disappointment is that the games are just not all that fun.  With the exception of throwing dynamite at the fish, most were just not funny.  Also, you have to play in single player mode to unlock the other games (you start off with just a few that are available to play.)

Additionally, this game would be a lot more fun if players could play head-to-head in multiplayer mode.  Instead, you have to let each player take a turn and then pass the remote to the next player. Since some of the games are kind of long, this can turn into a snoozefest quickly.

But, if you've never seen any of my other reviews for other Mortal Kombat games, here's why I really hate this game.

- Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was the beginning of the end for the series because THIS is the game that started the trend of having WAY TOO MANY unnecessary Mortal Kombat games on the market, making everyone who used to enjoy the series SICK TO DEATH of it.

- The actual fighting in this game is exactly the same as in Mortal Kombat 3. Which means, I hate it. It's like the company knew how much I hated the direction they took the Mortal Kombat series starting with the third installment, so they decided to create more or less the same game but with old familiar fighters returning. They did this on purpose to annoy ME. If the actual fighting stinks, it doesn't matter WHO returns. It's like Midway knew they made a mistake with the original Mortal Kombat 3 by introducing people to a list of all-new fighters, but they somehow DIDN'T realize that adding combos and a run button was the main reason Mortal Kombat 3 was such an awful game in the first place.  So running around delivering combos is *still* here.  BAD move.

- I hate when something is supposed to be the complete package, but instead, when you play the game, you find out that a bunch of things are missing. That's exactly what we have with this game. It's sort of like opening up a Christmas present to find nothing but styrofoam chips inside.

- Fair respawn amount. You get tossed back to your ship after some few minutes of inactivity. You must rekill everything you just did before the phone rang. Some respawns are 10-20 minutes of refighting the same battle.
- Side missions to help you level up in case you are having a hard time with some enemy or other. In Destiny, you can redo old missions or go to an arena where Bill Nighy drones on about retaking area A or B.

This isn't all, though. Lets put pricing aside for a second.

One cannot complain about the graphics, but a story is more than pretty pictures--it's got to make sense.  Hence, this script is non-sensical.

Uncharted should have never gone to multiplayer--it should have focused everything on the campaign mode and nothing else.  That's why the first Uncharted will always be the best.

The first game was dark, the 2nd was darker and this one was the darkest.  It doesn't come out and say it in words, but it's all in symbolism and silent in the background as one plays.  Another thing you should be aware of is that Naughty Dog copied the desert idea and the ending from the movie ""The Mummy"" (1999).  I'm surprised Universal Studios hasn't sued them for the theft--the studios are always complaining about copyright breeches and here's a big one.

But the creators of this game loss many stars for erasing all the credits one earns during the game and all you did, earned, accomplished is forgotten; meaning I could not upgrade the weapons for the other allies during another play through.  And if I ever decided to play it on a harder level my weapons would be just as wimpy as my very first game instead of all the upgrades I went through to strengthen and create a more powerful weapon which would have made playing at a harder level a tad easier.  If not for that screw-up and a few others, I would have gladly given it 5 stars.  Because the game strips away everything, it creates a barrier against playing it again.

All the characters were great but one and it happened to be the main character.  For starters, he's cross-eyed with a small head, arms as thick as his legs and his face reminds me more of a reptile than a male protagonist.  They tried to copy the Nathan Drake character from the hugely popular Uncharted series and failed. Instead you end up with a freakish appearing persona which I did not like in the least.  I would have greatly preferred his friend Bo or Charlie to have been the protagonist of the story.  They looked more like men than a badly put together human being.  I wish he would have been the one who turned out to be a robot so that the rest of the crew could have laid him to rest...permanently.  He appeared to be an inbred or a genetically fouled experiment.  Even the robot Cain had more personality than this guy.

Say you played the entire campaign once...maybe twice.  And one day you pick the game up and instead of going through the entire campaign again, you decide to just play certain chapters to concentate on certain characters in order to unlock the trust trophy associated with one of your allies. Say, you play for an hour or two and you quit, it saves and you think nothing of it.  Well, here's the bad news, I did just that and the next day when I pressed ""continue,"" instead of taking me back where I left off a day prior, it took me back to the last save of the full campaign--which was the last boss fight.  What miscreant thought up this post game menu of miserable choices that do not save data?  This game is not as great as I thought it was.  How can you select a chapter and it won't be saved--what's the point in playing it if you can't come back and pick up where you left off.

So, the only way for me to quit was to alt-F4 out of the program entirely. And when I called up the map, there seemed to be no way to get out of the map display!

Now, some games are so good that you put up with technical flaws in order to play them. This game is not one of those. I sure hope they're not charging much for the game itself. Perhaps an XP user could get it into shape, but I'm running Windows 7 and have no desire to go back. This was definitely not worth the price (free plus eight hours to download from Amazon's sloooow server).",-0.005058757509737902

Only 1yr for the 2 red lights, supposed 'overheating' fault, which I eventually got during a 10min game session and continue to get every once in a while.

1282,1.0,"The worst online gaming experience of my life. I can honestly not put it any better than that. My brief and I mean very brief 2 weeks stay in this game has left me permanently scarred for life. Second Life can be summed up none better than a paradise for trolls,perverts, and the socially awkward.

Most of SL is about virtual sex as you will see have dressed characters and in game adult themed places and items pretty much everywhere. Even in non adult areas. You simply can't avoid it. Anyone who plays will lie to you and try to sell you the game as a ""virtual"" world where you can sight see and build things but that honestly makes up a small portion of the game. Maybe people did that 8 years ago but today those places are empty.

Second Lifes population has dwindled as people moved on with their lives but all thats really left are the type of people that you would more than likely not wish to be involved with in any life. Desperate housewives that use the game to virtually cheat on their husbands, lunatics that think the game is real and have substituted it for their actual life, Grown adult weirdoes that like to dress up as animals or role play as children (sure might sound innocent but nothing in this game is innocent), sexual predators and the sexually perverted mostly found playing something called Gorean or running around in rape cities, nerdy adults that want to be vampires, and above all else the worst crowd of all needy/clingy people that use Second Life to get a girlfriend or boyfriend because they fail to do so in the real world.

Its hard to play Second life without feeling pathetic or feeling pity for the people that do play it and have been playing it faithfully for years. Then theres the age old tale of My first life is great but they dump at least 80 hours a week into an online game. Give me a break. Youre real life sucks thus why your in SL trying to escape it. The common lie in second life is that its not a game but a virtual world. This will be told to you over and over again by the highly delusional players of second life. Second life IS a GAME. Just a very outdated one thats no longer relevant. Those that still think of it as a virtual world should perhaps actually catch up to modern times and see what other games youve been missing. If I had to sum it up Second Life is like Grand Theft Auto with the creativeness of Little big planet except without the fun and a terrible buggy platform and engine to build on.

Its a sandbox game where you decide what your fun should be. Its still a game and an MMORPG as everyone on there is role-playing. Either role playing that they're attractive as their avatar or role playing that this game doesnt suck. Its a virtual world as much as any MMORPG with a chat interface and zones to explore or any other online game. The only difference with second life is that the developers make RW money off the land players purchase to build their imaginary zones (which cost hundreds of real dollars youll waste).

So is the game good or is it bad? Well? As a game it was probably good maybe 6-8 years ago but it hasn't aged well. It has the graphics of Windows 95, the world is highly glitchy and buggy. Vehicles can hardly be used because so many places don't allow them and their buggy anyway even if you get to use them, the game crashes randomly and constantly, and to top it off the game is highly tolerant of its problems so they're never fixed.

If you enjoy games youve probably already played plenty better than this and ones albeit with saner people. The most normal folks youll encounter in this game are the trolls because the trolls now its a game and are there to get a laugh. Other players? Well they just seem someone lost mentally.

Some might think its harsh for me to say those things but until you venture into this world you wouldnt truly understand. Second Life is just a haven for delusional people with mental problems to bring their problems into a gave where they can live life as normal as they possibly can by pretending to be normal.

I met a guy playing a Furry shemale Wolf/Aligator as they explained to me in their profile. If that alone doesnt make you eyebrows raise than you might be ready to play second life. Whatever this game once was it is no longer and its no surprise that any corporation pulled themselves from this game as soon as they saw what a cesspool it was. The good community is apparently gone and the company that youd much rather not keep is left.

Id say if you must play second life than play it but do so with caution. If youd rather keep your sanity theres much better games out there now a days to play.",0.012769171633395363

There is no voice dialogue.  Characters' mouths move, but there are no words. Instead, there is written text on screen that you get to read, and then click on your text response.

The graphics are dated, and remind me of a kids game...very colorful.

Space and planet graphics are very 2 dimensional.

Also, I had frequent problems with freezing which I expected to and extent because bf3 had a small problem with that as well but bf4 is way worse.

1300,1.0,"I've never been so disappointed in any game for the PS3 as much as I have been disappointed in Media Molecule's ""Little Big Planet.""  This was one of the worst video game experiences I've ever had in my life.

Initially I thought I was going to love it because of the cool graphics.

Unfortunately, they made it too hard.  One of those British idiots decided to only allot you 4 lives per section. But some of the sections are infuriatingly difficult, so when you fail them, you have to go back to the entire beginning of the level.  Why couldn't they have just given you infinite lives?  That way, the game would have been fun to explore and savor.  As it is, you don't want to bother collecting anything (e.g., the stickers) because there's no guarantee you'll survive the level, and if you don't, all your work will have been for nothing.

And when you are bounced back to the beginning of the level, you won't think the graphics are so fun anymore.  In fact, this entire game has overtones of punishment.  The sad part is, this could have been easily fixed:  they could have either:

1. given you infinite lives;
2. given you infinite jump ability;
3. made it so that your character can grab on to ledges and pull himself up;
4. or at least allowed you to save and load from your last checkpoint, so that you can practice only the part you're not getting.
5. allowed to you pay your unused lives forward;
6. or at least had different difficulty settings

or something.

But making you go all the way back to the beginning of each level was pure viciousness.  It's just torture with a cutesy face!  I'd like to meet the gamer who is agile enough to make it through the ""Wheel of Death"" in the ""Bunker"" level, yet who is excited about earning a ""flower print dress"" at the end.

I don't mind games being difficult.  Lord knows I've made it through some pretty hard video games.  What I do mind is all your work being incinerated and not counting for anything and having to do it all over again.  Again and again.

I suspect the reason Media Molecule set it up this way is that if they hadn't, you'd be able to finish this game in about 3 hours, so little content is there.  But making it so that if you die 4 times in any one section you have to repeat the entire level, this was a way, I suspect, of making the game last at least 2 or 3 days.

And most of the time you die, it's not even your fault.  See, this game isn't 2D.  It's not 3D.  It's somewhere in the middle (I believe programmers call this ""2.5D"").  It looks like a 2D platformer, but there are actually three lanes you can be in:  the foreground, the middleground, and the background.  The problem is that, not only is it hard to tell what lane you're in in any given moment (you're not allowed to pan the camera about), but the game thinks nothing of bouncing you back and forth between these lanes without your having requested this, such as when you bump in to a wall or when you land from a jump.  So you'll keep dying on a lot of the jumping challenges because you can't make out where on the Z axis your character is exactly, or which lane your target spot is in.

When I first saw this in the store and fired it up, I thought it was some sort of science game.  The kind where kids would play a cute character and learn about gravity, friction, temperature, whatever.  Actually, it's the complete opposite of a science game:  it teaches kids not to explore . . . exploring is not worth the risk, because likely you'll wind up getting electrocuted and have to start the stupid maze all over from the beginning.

And here's the final insult:  the game claims that it saves your data ""automatically,"" except that it doesn't, or at least it doesn't do it predictably.  I had serious problems with this.

The day I finished this game, I had played it for about 12 hours straight:  straight from, I think, the Serpent Shrine all the way up to the Collector, whom I finally defeated at about 3:00 in the morning.  My games were not saved, even though I went back to the ""Pod"" several times during the course of the day.  After finally defeating the final boss, my save game only showed that I had made it up to the ""Endurance Dojo.""  Why did it save up to that point but no further?

This was definitely not on account of my having shut my PS3 off at the wrong moment:  having experienced this before and having assumed it was owing to some fault of mine, I, after finishing, took great pains to exit using the circle button to get all the way back to your spaceship where it says ""Use Pod Computer"" so that it would definitely save the fact that I had finished the game.

But even that wasn't enough to get it to save my game.  There's no way to force a manual save, either.  In short, the creators of this game owe me a completed game file, because I'm sure as heck not going to go through those levels again!  And I need hardly mention that the wankers at Media Molecule won't permit you to use another user's savedata file.  (I currently believe you have to exit to the PS3 and choose ""Quit Game"" for your data to be saved . . . still not sure, though.)

Truly the worst game I know of for the Playstation 3.  I didn't have a minute of fun with it.  I regret every moment I spent with it.  I thought I was going to be treated to all sorts of eye candy but was just in a rage the entire time I was playing it.  My poor wife.

Lesson learned:  avoid all titles by Media Molecule, or titles for which you can discern that Mark Healey or Alex Evans had a hand in making.  They make games evil on purpose and then market them as though they're for kids.

Here's hoping Media Molecule soon goes out of business!  And may 10,000 camels poop on the graves of its programmers!",-0.027498799998552453

1306,1.0,"If you are reading this, chances are you are a fan of RPGs and are already deciding on buying this. That's fine. My review won't change your opinion. If however, you are one of the newer ones who want to venture into this world, it might not be your cup of tea.

Despite the rave reviews it has gotten, the word I can sum the game up is: repetitive. The core design of the game is essentially moving through areas, slashing at monsters, collecting items and leveling up. That is essentially what you'll be doing for hours, weeks, months and perhaps years.

The graphics are not up to the standards of other games. However, I believe they had to do this in order to allow 4-player splitscreen mode. The music is very interesting, ranging from moody techno music to sorrowful tones.

You are given the choice to choose 1 of 12 classes and change the looks of the character you are given. The classes are broken down into 3 archetypes: hunters, rangers and force. Hunters are melee fighters that fight head-on with enemies. Rangers use ranged weapons obviously and force is like the spell-casting class of the game. Within each class, you'll have some divisions such as a guy who's beefier in damage and accuracy, yet lacks the ability to cast any spell at all.

Once you make a character, you are given some sort of ID that determines item drops in the game for you. You then arrive in the lobby area. Here is where you'll spend your time in the game. There is a shop to trade, sell and buy items, a medical station to heal wounds, a mission area to get more assignments and an elevator to allow you to talk to the space government. The story is loosely about a colony of humans that are inside a ship that want to colonize a planet. However, they send hunters to check if the location is safe before landing.

There are two chapters to the game, hence the title, Episodes I and II. For multiplayer, you are given a splitscreen mode for up to four players. You used to be able to play online through Sega, if you purchased a Hunter's License, which is a fee of $15 each month. It's been discontinued, but there are private servers floating around that you can join.

To conclude, PSO is a game that's been done before here and there. Slashing at monsters to loot them is not revolutionary, nor does it require player skill. You are going to play this game for many hours, but I don't think all those hours will be enjoyable. The true value of this game is in the online play, but even that is marginalized when you think about all the other games that let you do that and more (Diablo 2).

If spending all your time grinding at simple-AI programmed monsters to collect items is your idea of fun, this game will be your fantasy. Otherwise, if you are like me, you'll feel unchallenged.",0.01002344697464954
1307,1.0,"After playing Live for the 360, it made me fall asleep, it was boring and while the graphics are excellent, it just has this weird vibe. The shots do not come off right, the shooting animation is so slow that you can have a wide open guy on the wing and by the time he gets up and into the air and release the shot, a defender can make up serious ground and block it.  Against the computer, I had JJ Reddick and Turkoglu blocked 5 times apiece by Mourning and Shaq coming from the basket on what were wide open shots. There are also a ton of missed dunks, even Howard missed several. It is hard to pull of three's as well, since their guaranteed bricks.

The point guard and fatigue issue also sucks. The comp team never subs regardless of sliders. And their point guard scores 90% of the points. I played vs. Milwaukee and Maurice Williams scored practically every basket. This occured regardless of what level. Edit player is also a joke; I cannot edit the height, but at least I can edit the number and position. The rosters were supposed to be as of Aug. 24th, but where is Turiaf? And why is Battie a FA, he was never renounced or waived!

The press box angle is actually not bad. I dunno why Live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways, things like hook-shot style passes, behind the backs, even though the situation does not need those. The subsitution is also clunky; you can do the sub using the D-pad during a break in the action, but by the time you select the player you are bringing in, the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the court.

The timeouts are also timed, as in if you call a 20, there is a 20 second clock and so on. But you can always press a button to continue. The archs on the shots are off as well. Who shoots a high-archer in the paint? There are no retroes unless their unlockable. The courts look good but they don't have mascots, so it seems kinda dead. That should be the new name of this series. NBA DEAD 07.

However, after playing through the first two difficulty levels, the game has once again become more of a chore than fun. The exception is when more than one friend is online and willing to form a group. Unfortunately, the game is already mostly dead (from the perspective of my friends list), with most people already moving on to other games.

The story is nearly non-existent, but I didn't buy the game or its predecessor for the story. The music isn't memorable at all. Graphics are average. The interactive environment is a joke, as is the crafting ability. Latency introduced by the forced client-server model is annoying. If you have young children like me, this game is horrible.

It does little things well (goal songs, ECHL, AHL) but the most important thing is gameplay, and this game is not fun to play.  Here is what you will experience if you buy this game:
1. Terminator level AI.  They are out to destroy your firstborn.  You cannot pass, shoot, or skate without them crushing you.
2. Random goals.  Never for you, always against.  Shot from behind the blue line, random bouncy puck, shot your goalie sees all the way, just terribad.
3. ""Physics"". at EA, they must think this word is similar to pinball, because that is what the puck does.
4. Opponent God mode.  They will cycle sometimes, and you just know a goal is coming.  Nothing you do will separate man from puck, literally nothing.
5. A soundtrack that feels like you're shopping at Forever 21.  It's fitting for this game, there is no physicality that is traditionally associated with hockey, so the soundtrack works perfect.  It makes me want to get a pumpkin spice latte and buy some uggs.
Why God, why do I keep buying this game.  I will NEVER pay full price for EA hockey.  I would recommend against this one, even if you can get it cheap.  I think the true value of this game is somewhere around $15.  I would implore EA to fix this game, but we all know they are on cruise control with most of their games.

I could have spent my money on something much better than this string of snapshots with voiceovers attatched.  If this game were freeware, I probably would have liked it, but it's not.  Instead, it's a twenty dollar game that plays like freeware and has packaging like Myst.
Incidentally, it was the references to Myst on the packaging that led me to buy this game.  The packaging says, ""Think Myst but in a real location"" (Quandary).  True, like this game, Myst was basically snapshots of a fictional world that you could occaisionally interact with, much like this game, but there's a few big differences between Myst and this game.  Myst never really felt like a string of snapshots to me, because the world it depicted was so beautiful and mysterious, and the puzzles were so engaging.  Capri is beautiful, but moving through it is confusing and frusterating.  There are so many places where one street looks just like another, which makes getting turned around or lost really easy, unless you check the map every step of the way, and doing that just makes the game feel even more clunky.  I enjoyed the scenery in Myst, but I could care less about the many, many snapshots of streets that A Quiet Weekend in Capri includes.  There should really be a better way to navigate the world of this game.  I haven't finished this game yet, but the puzzles mostly seem to involve doing errands for people, which, combined with the frusterating navigation, becomes incredibly tedious.  The people themselves are another annoying aspect of the game.  It's impossible to talk to any of them, which seems odd for a game that takes pride in being located in a real place.  You'd think being able to talk to people would add to the reality of it.  The people themselves are also snapshots, by the way.  They are never animated, even when they're talking - even Myst animated talking people.  There are, in fact, very few animations in this game.
This game has, for me, redefined bad games.  I cannot believe that someone allowed this game to be released.  It's amazing to me that someone seriously thought that basing a game off of thousands of touristy photographs would be a good idea - and some of the photos aren't even all that good, blurry, with bad composition, or lens flares.  My plan is to sell this game as soon as I can.  Although I can't get cash from any of the places in my area, I can get game credit.  The next time around, I'll make sure I thoroughly research the game before I buy it.  This game may cost only twenty dollars, but it's a waste of every one of those dollars.

1328,1.0,"I preordered the limited edition of this game expecting way too much out of it. I thought since it came with the season pass it would be a good deal and bungie would deliver as usual but boy was I wrong. This game just involves a whole lot of time and grinding with little reward. To start off the multiplayer is fun but nothing special. I would say that if you were looking for a multiplayer only game go for battlefield, halo, or cod. The campaign was the worst part. Being a huge halo fan I thought the singleplayer would be amazing but it was just boring and repetitive. I have unfortunately put in 40 hours into this game and I can say it takes FOREVER to rank up. I'm at 26 right now and I can find no way to get past it. I just completed 3 queens bounties and received 3 legendary chestplates (I already have an exotic one) all I needed was anything else legendary, boots, helmet, gauntlets, but I got THREE chest armor. I dismantled them instantly and threw the game at a wall. This game take way too much time for the little or no reward they give you. I spent 15+ hours farming on the Comosdrone and I probably got 30 legendary engrams and 95% of them turn into rare gear that is 10x worse than the ones you have equipped. Also upgrading gear like my exotic chest is nearly impossible. You need 18-24 ascendant shards which are extremely hard to find and you have to spend hours upon hours on end patrolling venus for spirit bloom. Overall not enough put into this game to keep playing for a substantial time.

EDIT:

Well they came out with a new patch the other day that fixes a decent amount of problems I had with the game. They fixed it so when you do happen to get that extremely rare legendary drop, it will actually give you a legendary weapon/gear or better. However I still believe it's too little too late. I'm 28 now and I have literally completed the game. I did all strikes on 28 difficulty, did the raid, beat the campaign twice over, and invested 15 hours into their terrible multiplayer. The game's been out for 3 weeks or so and was just not worth the hundred bucks I spent on it. All I have left to do in the game is farm 120 ascendant shards and hit level 30.

I tried the game this way.  Its TERRIBLE.  This kind of precision work needs both hands on the wiimote, holding it horizontally - like a traditional gamepad.

They have to realize a game like this requires precision, and as such, the needs of their gamers will vary.  Why couldn't they offer alternate controls?

Your point of view and your weapon's aim are integrated into the same movements which is completely unnatural and results in very bizarre, unrealistic gameplay.

Multiplayer mode is a complete exercise in frustration.

This game however is even too hard for me. The difficulty level is insane. The tracks are full of right angle turns, tricky s curves, hard to miss traffic, and drivers you compete against that are absoutely brutal. The sponsor races are near impossible for anybody without driving skill nearing that of godly.

I was warned before I bought this game that it can make people who never get mad at games extremely enraged. I was even shown a photo of what somebody did to a PS2 controller. However, I just figured that was those people's character fault and got this game anyway with the mindset I would not give into getting mad. Well, after trying 15 or so times to beat the SAME race I was so angry that I started smashing the controller over my head as hard as I could! And what I did to myself after that to relive the extreme stress I am probably not allowed to talk about on here so I will leave it out. But I really hurt myself and it left me emotionally scarred. For like two weeks after I stopped playing the game I was extremely short fused with people and freaking out and SCREAMING AND YELLING AND BREAKING THINGS every time some little thing went wrong in my life. And I am never like this. I had just lost my ability to handle stress.

Oh, I should also mention, that unless you win a race you get nothing, absoutely nothing. Unlike Burnout 3 you do not get any points you won unless you win the race. Had a really insane drift that earned you like 1,500 reputation points? Well if you lose the race too bad you aren't getting it.

This game is perfect if you have no girlfriend/boyfriend, job, social life, or basically any form of physical or social activity that differs you from that of a rusted lawn chair. This game does nothing but steal time away from you. If you have time to waste good, you'll be spending hours here. If you plan to leave the World of Warcraft to shower,eat,sleep,use the bathroom etc,you obviously don't belong there. This game does nothing but replace real life goals and accomplishments met through realife hardwork with digital goals that are met with the same amount of time applied. The difference being the accomplishments you wasted your time on in the game mean absolutely and I mean absolutely nothing! They have no value whatsover accept to other people like yourself trapped in the game.

 I got so tired of people talking about what they do in this game like it's an actual accomplishment. You played since it's release? who cares? You have Tier whatever gear who cares? You have some magic mount no one else in the game has who cares? You have tons of fake game gold who cares? None of this stuff matters to people that live in the real world. Do you think anyone cares that I killed King Bowser back in 1989? Or that I upgraded my standard blaster to a missle blaster in Metroid in 1988? Or how about the time I found the secret ring in Sonic the Hedge Hog when I got my first Sega? NO ONE CARES A BOUT WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISHED IN A GAME! IT'S MEANINGLESS! IT HAS NO REAL WORLD VALUE!

 Every inch of this game is festered with morons that simply can't understand that. At first I thought it was mostly just ignorant kids...but these are adults! Yes, grown adults! Acting like they are children. Some I even know of to have neglected their own children just to play the game. I brought The WoW the first game because it was new and I enjoyed it...but it was short lived with all the drama. I brought the Burning Crusade because my guild annoyed me until I did (I was the guild master). I had to always have the best armor and weapons to keep up with and lead these morons. It was a real pain in the behind. The game felt so much like a job.

  All the expansion does is add more hours for you to waste getting better armor and more dungeons to drag yourself through for 10 exciting levels of doing the same quest over and over again. If you like living your life on par with that of a coat hanger... or maybe a lawnmower in the dead of winter. Than this game is perfect for you.

Budokai 2 is the best DBZ game I've ever played, and I've played quite a few. But this game SUCKS. There is no ""fun"" aspect. My neighbor borrowed it from another neighbor, and we played, because it sounded fun. It's DBZ, but there's free-roam, and co-op. Nothing bad, right? Wrong. You run around and beat things up. That's where the fun starts, and where it ends. There are six playable characters, too bad there's only one, two differences between that person, and all the others. You run, fight, fly, fight, blow up rocks trying to find DBZ coins, fight, destroy the disc knowing that you aren't going to get more than a dollar for it, you cry over $20 lost. Why is it that the biggest hyped games aren't nearly as good as they were cracked up to be? Pariah, Prey, MK: Shaolin Monks, Tomb Raider: Legend, etc. etc.

Gameplay: 1/10 As I explained in the above paragraph, you run, fly, and fight. The try to keep the gameplay up by adding these coins, Which are just out of flying reach. You can blow up mountains, but you can't fly 6 inches higher? The flying is really just hovering there, with little flames coming off of your feet. There really isn't much to talk about here, because there isn't much else that I haven't explained.

Sound: 1/10 Could they try to make more annoying sounds and music? Well, I suppose they could use the Goldeneye: Rogue Agent DS music.

Graphics: 1/10 This game has worse graphics than MK: Deception's Konquest mode, which is just another way to get koins. I'm not kidding. Okay, how about this: the graphics are worse than the Cat in the Hat game.

Value: 0/100 The only reason you'd actually pay $[...] for this game is if you are 6 years old, mentally deranged, or you're a masochist. I wouldn't take the game unless you paid me $[...] or more in cash.

She then also purchased a 2.5"" 5400RPM 80GB hard drive to replace the smaller 40GB Hard drive in the PS3.

So I was taken advantage of by selling the older model for the newer model price and making me pay 109.98 extra for the upgrades.

In these respects Grandia is at the top of its class, and it makes the first half of the game a spectacular ride. As much fun as part one is, the second disc is a huge disappointment,

The story is a horrific mess, a little kid could craft a story with more compelling characters and narrative. It is a huge shame because the voice actors are the very best in the business, but their talent cannot make up for the huge mess of a story. Theres not a hint of intrigue or suspense, and either the dialog was translated poorly or the writers were just terrible. The second disk brings nothing new to the system, bring the story down even dumber, and becomes an exercise in frustration instead of fun. There are no extra sidequests or bosses, you already access the strongest spells halfway through the game, and the most annoying enemies are the ones populating the entire final dungeon.

Less than an hour from the final boss I would have thrown it out it was just so bad (and that is where the game should be at its most exciting!)

The clip that mounts on your baseball cap is made of anodized materials that reflect the IR beam back to the transmitter - there are no electronics in the 'hat clip' itself.

I was able to find out through the gamer grapevine and industry grapevine what a piece of garbage this software was going to be.  Then I watched the install and playing of this game on a friend's computer to verify what I've heard, and yes it is true as stated by numerous other reviewers here.

I won't waist my time and yours repeating what has already been said.  But yes Blizzard makes you jump through many hoops and then tightens the hoops around your neck.  They treat the paying public like criminals who buy their products and who made their company.  I have a comment about that, ""don't bite the hand that feeds you.""  The large price for a game that is only 1/3 complete with only the terrain part of the game, and the fact that you have to be connected to the internet to play the game, to get any more maps, and to get your game saves/stats, etc.  Also, you can never reset your account it is the same for life unless you pay for another copy of the game, plus you can only play with people in your region, period.  And yes, one must be connected to the internet to play the full installed version of the game.  If you are not connected the game does not have full features.  AND every 4 weeks you must connect to your online account or your game will shut down, and that's for the life of the game.  Also, the Blizzard server saves and compiles data and all your stats from the game whether you want it or not; and it stays as part of your account for the life of your game and you can not change or reset it without buying another copy of the game.  Also, for small extra online addons here and there you will pay and pay again if you want them.

All this sounds great huh?  This is borderline criminal if not criminal.  It is apparent that this industry needs to be caught up to modern times with some form of regulation.  The consumer needs privacy and protection from this kind of crap.  Phone companies can not listen in on your calls just because they made the phone, and car companies can not track you and tell you to drive the car to their home office every month so they can make sure you are doing the right thing with the car.

I think its best to stay away from this game and this company.  I will not ever buy anymore of their so called products.  And they are now releasing Diablo 3 that will be just like this.  Don't make me laugh.

I write this as a warning to those who don't know what this company is doing.  Don't waist your money.  Save yourself the hassle, the headaches, and the aggravation.  Again, I count myself lucky that I did not throw my money down the hole called Blizzard.

1417,1.0,"Lately, the word Nintendo has almost become synonymous with thinking outside of the box.  First they released Wii Sports to the glee of consumers, which played a major role in increasing the size of the casual market.  Next came Wii Fit, which also sold like hotcakes despite having a ninety dollar price tag.  These unique gameplay concepts appealed to people, because they could partake in non-strenuous physical activity in the comfort of their home.  Pick up and play games have become increasingly popular, and Wii Music has been designed in the same mold.  Unlike the previous two games however, Wii Music fails to deliver an experience that will captivate most consumers.  The marketing behind Wii Music will likely trick your average consumer, but the gameplay behind it will probably disappoint most people once they get their hands on it.  Swinging a racket in Wii Tennis was a lot of fun, because it felt similar to the real thing without being overly complex, but Wii Music's gameplay feels as if it were made for those not yet ready to enter grade school, even though it is an experience made for everyone.

Admittedly, the concept behind Wii Music is a good one--the game claims to have 60 playable instruments, but in reality, that isn't entirely true.  While there are 60 instruments, there are only four control methods, so you are basically playing the same four instruments the entire game.  Sure, they sound slightly different--close to their real life counterparts with a diminished sound quality, but using them feels the same.  One of these control methods has you holding the instrument like a recorder--you hold the instrument close to your face and alternate pressing the 1 and 2 buttons.  You'll do this for most wind and brass instruments included in the game.  The next control method has you playing
guitar-like instruments by holding the Wii-nunchuk steady in your left hand, while moving the Wii-mote up and down as if you were strumming a guitar.  Unlike the recorder-like control, this doesn't feel much like the real thing.  The third control method has you playing instruments such as the piano and drums by moving your left and right hands up and down as if you were hitting a drum.  Many of the instruments use this control method, so eventually this gets tiresome.  I often felt like I was a baby throwing a tantrum.  Actually, if I was a baby, I probably would throw one because of the boring, repetitive gameplay.  Finally, the fourth control method has you holding your left hand steady while moving your right hand horizontally and simultaneously pressing the B button.  This movement is meant to simulate moving a bow across the string as you would with a violin or cello.  These four methods are decent during your first thirty minutes playing Wii Music, but they quickly grow old, and don't give you the feeling that you're playing real instruments.

Not only are the control methods flawed and unoriginal, but the core gameplay is lacking as well.  Unlike Guitar Hero and Rockband, there aren't scores or ways of capturing how well you play.  In jam sessions, where you can play with up to four people, there are note charts you can look at, which tell you the optimal places to play the notes, but you are also encouraged to use improvisation to give the pieces you play a unique flair.  This is a cool feature, but your pieces will never sound as good as you hope, due to the low quality sound in Wii Music.  It would be nice if the pieces featured CD quality sound, but I suppose that won't be a huge issue to kids just looking to have fun.  Still, the game definitely feels lacking since it doesn't really have a system in place to help you perform the pieces the way they were meant to sound.  Like other reviews have said, Wii Music is really more of a toy than a game.  There aren't many objectives to complete, and the gameplay is extremely simplistic for the most part.
Wii Music does have its merits however.  While the song list doesn't feature pieces that are popular today, it features many well known American classics, as well as world music.  I heard many of these songs as a kid, and it was cool to experience them again despite the poor quality audio.  Wii Music contains very little video game music: the Mario theme, Zelda theme, Mute City from F-Zero, and a couple Animal Crossing songs.  Well, it also includes the Wii Sports and Wii Music themes, but to me they just sound like elevator music.  It would have been great if more Nintendo songs were included, but the song list is still a good selection for general audiences for the most part.  Wii Music has many famous songs such as Ode to Joy, Minuet in G Minor, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, Yankee Doodle, and The Loco-Motion.  There are also international songs like Frere Jacques and Sakura.  The fifty included songs will keep you busy for awhile, but it is a chore unlocking them.  You have to go through many tedious ""training"" modes as well as watch many saved videos of your performances in jam sessions.  Even when you unlock all the songs, the repetitive nature of the game will quickly set in due to the lack of gameplay goals.

Besides single and multiplayer jam sessions, Wii Music includes a variety of other modes.  If you have a Wii Balance Board, you have the option of engaging in a special drum-training session that utilizes the board.  It is fun to mess around with in  a regular jam session, but the training mode is far too difficult due to the unintuitive nature of the control set-up.  A full drum set includes many parts, so it is understandable that this mode isn't easy, but Nintendo could have made it a little more intuitive.  It is difficult to manage using your feet on the board and waving both arms in a variety of ways, while holding or depressing buttons at the same time.  Some of the motions do drastically different things depending on what button you're holding down, so it all just becomes too much to keep track of.  If you have a board, just mess around with it in jam sessions.  The other modes are less complex and are generally more enjoyable.

Handbell Harmony is an entertaining mode that has you using your rhythm skills.  In this mode, your Mii holds two different colored bells at the top of the screen.  On the main section of the screen, you'll find colored bells scrolling by, and when your colored bells enter a bell shape contained in a bar on the center of the screen, you swing your arm that is holding that color.  In this mode, you are graded on how well you do, so it is fun challenging yourself to see if you can get the correct timing when the mode is set at high tempo.

Pitch Perfect is another fun mode, but it is more in lines with music education than actual playing.  For those who have perfect pitch or have played an instrument in the past, you'll probably find this mode fairly easy.  I managed to breeze through all the lessons but one without losing, and that one loss was due to a minor mistake.  This mode could be useful to those who are new to music, but it may also be frustrating to those who lack patience.

The other two modes are fairly disappointing.  One of them, Mii Maestro, has you conducting a symphony.  To conduct, you simply lift your arm then bring it down at whatever speed you wish.  This allows you to control the tempo and volume of the orchestra.  It doesn't feel very accurate however.  I used to be in a symphony, so I have witnessed a conductor on multiple occasions, and conducting is much more complex than a simple up-and-down hand motion.  It didn't feel very accurate, and even though I knew some of the pieces and have good rhythm, I still couldn't figure out how to get a high score for some of the songs.

The final mode is a set of lessons for various styles of music.  There are lessons for rock, jazz, reggae, classical, and Japanese music.  Each of these lessons teaches you little tricks for using certain instruments, but the techniques given are difficult to remember, and you'll quickly become bored after playing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star over sixty times.  It was nice to be able to hear each instrument and learn what instruments go well together, but the way in which the techniques are taught will make you wonder why you are wasting time with this game.

Lastly, I will briefly mention Wii Music's presentation.  The presentation is similar to Wii Sports and Wii Fit--the interface is simplistic, and a minimalistic approach is used with the graphics.  This likely won't surprise anyone who has played other casual games for Wii.  I like how the interface is simple, but there are some design flaws.  For one, the musical maestro who teaches you everything is extremely annoying, and someone who observed me play this game commented that he sounded like he was speaking gibberish with Mario's voice.  He quickly becomes annoying, and at times there is far too much text.  One aspect of the presentation is impressive however--I like how you can send videos of your performances to friends online.  While sharing videos is a cool feature, it doesn't do much for Wii Music since it is such a boring game.  It is unlikely that your friends will want to yawn at your videos when they are already bored to tears by their own.

I am extremely disappointed with Nintendo's latest casual game for Wii.  As a long time supporter of the company and Shigeru Miyamoto, I was surprised at how mundane this title turned out to be.  I was definitely expecting more in the gameplay department.  There are many other casual games that are more fulfilling than Wii Music.  Nintendo has gotten lazy recently, and to keep them in check, I recommend that consumers avoid this title and make better use of their money by purchasing one of the great original games that have been released this year.

1425,1.0,"First off, let me say that I really loved, and still do play the first Max Payne game that came out in 2001. A New York City Police detective comes home to find his wife and baby brutally Murdered by the Mafia, so he decides to go after them himself, and now, he's on the run from his former partners. The linear story, the comic book cut scenes, shoot dodging, bullet time, all made the first game work, and it worked very well. Then the second game came out, and while it did take me a bit to get into the game, I finally did, but was a bit too short. The second game was released in 2003. After the release of the second game, I had wondered, as did many others if we would ever see a 3rd game. Rumors we're circulating that we wouldn't, and finally Rockstar announced sometime later we would eventually. This was 4 to 5 years ago. Then finally, it was confirmed by Rockstar that Max Payne 3 was in development, this got my hopes up that it would be a good game. First off, let me say that I have seen some other people say that this is an epic game, one of the best they have played. It is far from epic. Way too many cut scenes in the game to make this enjoyable. I got it for Playstation 3, and felt like I was playing(very little), and watching more of a mini series. 60 bucks to own a movie.

Watch the puck teleport through my goalie's pad.  Not screened, no deflection, a shot a high school goalie could stop.  Oh, did I mention this goal tied the game?  This is the kind of crap you will put up with if you play this game.  Keep the team to the perimeter, clear the crease, game tying goal on an easy shot.  I can't believe I paid $60 for this.

So I wrote a long review of this game, but came back to edit after playing 25 games.  It kills me to say this, but this game sucks.  There is a comeback engine in the game that is maddening, frustrating, and makes the game little to no fun to play.  Basically, if you score, plan on the opponent scoring as well.  I've had games up 5-0, 4-0, and 3-0 going into the third, invariably the opponent will go into ""God Mode"" and become unstoppable.  I've had opponents do the following:
1. Skate through 4 defensemen, score over the goalie's pad even with the goalie having the angle
2. Take a terrible shot, the kind you don't even take in hope of rebound, that the goalie doesn't see until the last second, despite a lack of a screen
3.  Get poke checked only to do a 180 degree turn from the waist to grab the puck and take a shot that goes in from the high slot, again with no screen
4.  Dump the puck from the rear blueline on the PK, only to bounce on net and become too hot to handle for my goalie
5.  The piece de resistance; a poke check from a tied up face off that sneaks five hole despite being slow enough for my grandmother to handle

Every time these improbable things happen, and they happen with regularity, I am winning.  Mind you, none of these things happen if the game is scoreless, or you are losing, only if you are up.  It has gotten to the point where my wife said ""you don't even celebrate scoring goals any more"" and I don't because they will score to match you and keep it close.  I went into the season stats to find data to prove this, and it is there.  My goalie is leading the league in wins, but is 55th in Save Percentage and 49th in Goals Against Average.  The only reason this can be possible is because they always match me nearly goal for goal.

I should have known better after buying Madden 12.  Thing is NHL 12 was so fun, I played that game like it was going out of style, and while goalies would let in the occasional softy in NHL 12, they are Patrick Roy compared to the goalies in NHL 14.  It's almost ironic that they chose a goalie for the cover of this years game because your goalie will suck in this game, no matter how well you play.  I even set my strategy to play more defensive, kept everyone back and only tried to score off the breakout, didn't matter, still gave up 4 (because I scored 4) and lost in a shootout.

1431,1.0,"GOOD: Fun game.  Credit where it is due. Great graphics/sound.  Decent if simplistic storyline.  Fun, if somewhat brief single-player game.

BAD: DRM nightmare. LAN play crippled. BattleNet is a huge pain, but you have to use it.  Can't play in different time zones. Can't spawn. Internet connection required. Paying customers treated like criminals. GREEEEED: it's only actually 1/3 of the game.  Look forward to the whole game costing you $180 (not for any special editions either).

Blizzard has likely hammered home the final nail in its coffin as a studio that ""gets it"".  What a huge difference between this and the original--and definitely NOT in a good way.  I pay for games.  I do not advocate piracy.  So why then, do pirates get a superior product?  Yes, the cracked version is already available all over the place, and that version lacks what makes this product so distasteful.

Having been a huge fan of the first game, I was bitterly disappointed that this one is so crippled, as well as being incomplete.  There comes a point where the bottom line of profit is directly impacted by one's reputation.  Blizzard took a running jump over it this time.  They went from one of the most respected studios on the planet to an entity that makes EA and Apple look positively enlightened by comparison.  To be fair, it is perhaps Activision that is to blame, but most folks will not take that into consideration.

Piracy is here to stay, as long as there are people who simply refuse to pay $60 for a computer game.  Thus far, no one has produced any DRM capable of stopping it (or even significantly reducing it).  The DRM does do a fine job of annoying the paying customers though. Why studios fail to see this is beyond me.  I suppose whoever builds DRM solutions has a really good sales team. Meanwhile, those who pirate the game get a better version than the one we pay for.

Luckily for Blizzard, the anticipation for this game was so frenzied that they will do quite well, I'm sure.  Millions have already purchased it.  I'm just wondering how many returns they will get.  They'll get one from me, that's all I can say for certain.  It will also be interesting to see how well they do selling the second and third parts, as well as any future games.  My guess is that they won't get quite the numbers they expect, unless changes are made.

Statistics have proven time and again that having even the most draconian DRM does nothing to reduce piracy, and that those who release a game without it somehow manage to do just fine (if it's a good game).  Some studios have learned this lesson.  Mass Effect 2 is a good example.  I happily purchased that game, after passing on the first one due to its DRM.  Hopefully Blizzard will make some changes and restore its reputation as a gamer-friendly company soon.",0.041466096146523225

1441,1.0,"First let me get a disclaimer out of the way, I love my 3DS, I love baseball, I love NickToons and I love arcade style fun games.  This is the worst 3DS game I have ever played.  Whats makes what I just said there more shameful, is I'm easy.  I'm an easy critic.  Up until now, there were no 3DS games I hated.  Even the weakest 3DS games I could find enjoyment in.  This is a horrible piece of junk.  I was hoping that all the reviews I read were wrong, they are not.  This game seems promising, its based off The Bigs games and off the NickToons MLB console version released on the Xbox 360/Wii.  Enjoyable games in my opinion, I like them alot.  This game has all the console version had and more, two new 3ds exclusive characters.  Several new exclusive modes.  I figured, wow, this should be fantastic.  Oh my...it is not.  Ok lets start with the biggest problem.  The controls, particularly the hitting controls.  They are button based, what could be wrong.  What if there is a two second lag between when you hit the button and when your player starts his swing.  Well thats exactly one big problem right there.  That's not an exaggeration.  There is a two second pause.  Why would button controls for a 3DS game made in 2012 made by a big company like 2K have such an atrocious lag.  That right there zaps the fun out of it.  If one singular aspect of a baseball game is broken, the entire game is broken.  But there are other problems.  Framerate, alot of people don't really understand what framerate is.  A game with a good framerate moves smoothly, it is not jerky in motion.  Well this game comes to a crawl whenever the game switches to fieldplay during a hit.  How slow, it feels like 10 frames per second.  Your average game is 30 frames per second.  Thats how slow and jerky the motion becomes.  Like when you play a powerful game on a weak computer, the computer can't run it properly.  The graphics, well they are below average but not horrible.  The 3DS is capable of much more graphically, but what are we to expect from a company that can't even get the controls right.  The graphics are a little rough but I've seen worse on the 3DS ultimately, the graphics do nothing wrong.  You just feel like they could have been better if whoever made this put some time into it.  The sound is not bad, the sound may very well be the best part of the game, you have fairly good fx.  You do get commentary.  Some of the commentary is new and exclusive to the 3DS version.  The only portion of this game that feels slightly like its console version is the pitching.  It even controls fairly well.  The outfield play is very poor, alot of animation has been removed, alot of things you could do in the console version is missing.  The players look very foolish out there in movement and the controls lag a little bit out there, lag and framerate problems at the same time are a terrible thing.  The entire hud that the console version had, which was almost entirely based off of THE BIGS franchise, is removed and replaced with a generic hud.  There is one cool thing about the 3DS versions layout, you have the commentators on the bottom screen with some occasional extra NickToons like animations.  I can't complain about that.  The 3D effect, I felt was fine...its a matter of taste.  I've played alot of 3DS games, some have 3D that pops out at you.  Others have 3D that is a depth effect.  This one is depth.  Basically, anything that doesn't move like menus and the hud, they are in the foreground.  The rest of the game is in the background.  While it doesn't make great use of the 3D and doesn't give you the feeling of immersion like some 3D games.  This definately has a 3D effect.  Wether you find it good, everyones opinion on Stereoscopic 3D varies greatly.  I thought it was average and perfectly fine.  This is a game that plays like your usual arcade style baseball game, mixing nicktoons characters with some MLB stars and some MLB stadiums.  There are also Nicktoons inspired stadiums.  Of course, it sounds good but the execution of this 3DS version is hideous.

Ultimately there is no reason why a good capable system like the 3DS should have a game this bad on it.  This is the 3DS' first fully equipped baseball game.  It can only get better from here.  Hitting is an impossible guessing game due to the two second lag.  The framerate drop during field play really ruins the action.  The only fun is the pitching.  2K should be ashamed to release a game like this.  This game is like this because it was made badly.  Not because of the system.  If the 3DS can run Resident Evil Revelations and Kid Icarus without missing a beat.  What is this games problem.  3DS deserves better, baseball games deserve better and NickToons deserve better.  AVOID

EDIT: Essentially this is a port of the DS version of the game.  Unbelievably enough, it plays better on the DS and with less lag.  The graphics are a little less.  But the framerate is smooth.  So all this game is, is a poor port of the DS game.  I don't find the DS game to be a masterpiece but I do think its much much better then this.  Give that one a look, it's probably cheaper and it'll work on your 3DS all the same.",0.012707625284731289
1442,1.0,"Payday 2 has great potential.  I payed for the digital pre-order a month before the game came out.  I got the bonus ""loot bag"" and the game on release day.  I have been playing it for about a week now and feel it is a good time for a review.  Payday 1 was almost too simple to play dn the levels were limited, but it was a lot of fun to play with a total of 4 real players controlling a villain.  I will start with the ""pros"".  Payday 2 does look a lot cleaner then Payday 1.  The gun play is good and the interaction with other players is fun.  There are a lot of missions instead of the limited few from Payday 1.  There are a total of 4 skill tiers you can do with your character and you can customize guns, masks and equipment.  Like I started out saying, this game had great potential and these pros I just shared were the selling points to get people hooked on Payday 2 to buy it.
Now for teh true issues with Payday 2. Payday 2 is impossible to play, literally!  Yeah you can play some very low level heists for bare minimum money, but you have to use your money to upgrade your skill sets, your weapons and your masks (which you never will get enough to fully build up your guy).  Skills should be free of cost and only cost points, masks should not cost any where near as much as they do...weapons are the ""fun"" item in the game to customize much like in Army of Two, but their costs in the game are outrageously high!.
When you play Payday 2 you get a payday at the end of each mission, but 90% goes into an offshore account that you can't access to use towards anything, then the extra cash you collect in the mission gets garnished too and you end up with bare minimum.  For example, I played a ""Hard"" mission (missions are rated out of 10 stars of white or gold depending on difficulty, Hard is 1 white and 3 Gold stars), when I finally finished the mission it said I collected $647,000 (sounds good right?) out of that money I only got $12,700 cash to spend towards skill points, masks customizing or weapon upgrades (for my next skill to be upgraded I need $242,000, for a decent gun I need $180,000 + cost to customize which would be about $250,000, or for a mask to be customized I would need to pay $80,000 to create it but each pattern you can only use once so it's not worth designing masks right now).  At my level obviously you want the gun customizing and weapon choices to have fun, but you are stuck saving to buy skill points because you want to be able to play with more of a pro character.  The game should have an option after you have $10 million in your offshore account to access additional funds to withdraw for your spending cash...or it should not cost for skill point upgrades (other then the level skill point to be placed when you have ones).  The gaming has great potential but I have 13 friends I play with online off and on at different times, we all bought this game and every one else quit playing it by day 5...I am on day 7 now trying to convince myself it won't be so bad if I get past a point...but it is getting less fun and more of a headache.
Very poor setup for this game.  The graphics are better but there are lots of bugs in the game as well.  I have been killed by being shot through walls (in one mission I was in a room w/ no one else in it and I died and was healed multiple times by a guy shooting through a wall at me and my AI team healing me from 2 building over); I have not been able to trade hostages to release team mates (a hostage will be highlighted but the game will not let me select them to release them when I am standing right over them); the choice cards at the end of finishing a mission (to give you weapon monds, masks, patters for masks) I have received 9 of the same pattern in a row (very sad since this was the one fun payout for ending a mission successfully); you still can not control the AI players when playing 1 player (which was a great option to have in Army of Two) so you get shot down or one of your other AI teammates the computer doesn't realize to shoot down the people assaulting you before healing so they come to heal you and die in the process of healing and if you have 2 AI people up and you get shot down then both die reviving you; and finally your guns you get don't hurt the police assault teams at all (I have shot down guys w/ no armor 3 or 4 times and they keep getting back up and don't die and with the size of the waves that attack per an assault there is no hope to have enough ammo to beat them if they don't stay dead when you shoot them down).
In my opinion, if they do a fix for the game to correct some of the bugs and fix the costs of items...and tone down the difficulty a bit (I know sounds like I'm whining there) then the game would be so much more fun.  Since missions are rated out of 10 stars and a mix of white and gold stars (gold being the most difficult) there should be no reason that a level 28 can't beat up to a 4 or 5 star mission and not to gloat but I level capped on Payday 1 for all tiers and play first person shooters all the time so I would think I would at least be a decent player.  My advice, watch the bulletin boards for true gamer reviews and decide if it's for you or not...also I would wait for a couple fixes to be put into place before wasting any money on this game, it's just not worth the cost or the headache of not accomplishing anything.",0.023320016292138587

1447,1.0,"Since other users have expatiated on the shortfalls of the game concisely, I will not reiterate.

What made me quit a month ago:
1) Blizzard's ""I want you to play the way we want you to play"" attitude + mass nerfage.
2) Unrewarding loot.
3) Extremely repetitive farming. In D2, you could move between acts to farm various places in one game. Cannot do that in D3. If you're stuck in Inferno act 2, there is no option but to farm Inferno Act 1 repeatedly.
4) The game provides no incentive for cooperative game plays.
5) Impervious champion mobs with ridiculous affix combos. Unless you spend enormous amount of time farming or spend real money, you will be forced to play cat-and-mouse game.
6) The game developers have no idea what they've done wrong. Skyrocketing repair cost is a good example of a horrible deterrent for corpse cannons.

I was happy to pop this game in after buying from Amazon and everything I've seen to the end...wow.  Disappointment can only explain so much for me.

The AP system from mk2 was one of the many highlights of the series' battle system, challenging my strategic gland to new heights that left me satisfied in the end.  The removal of this in Victory was a bad idea, resulting in battles being more about mindless brawn than fluent brain tactics, not to mention that the game's bosses forces you to grind to ridiculous levels to take them down and eventually beat the game.  My party was around Level 90+ by the time I beat it, which to me is far too high of a level requirement to beat it.  Sure, there's DLC to increase your party's Level Cap, but that should've been there from the start.  The Scout system is also some of the most flawed mechanics I've seen in the RPG universe as paying them to reveal hidden dungeons, monsters, and items with a 50% chance turns the whole thing into a gambling game, making the Scout system are far worse alternative to spend your hard-earned gold on.  The story and character cast was also lacking (at least, compared to the first two games) in that the story is merely just ""Neptune goes into the past to meet more CPUs and kick more tail"" while the cast is mainly just CPUs without Compa or even IF (DLC don't count) nearby to join them on their quest to help shake up the variety.

There are plenty more problems I had with this game, but this is all I can explain in full without going overboard.  The only good things Victory did for me are having a notification mechanic alerting you to when you completed a Quest, as well as new clothing for Neptune, Noire, and Blanc.  Other than those, the bad outweighs the good for me and once I've gotten the normal ending, I just put the game back into its box and never bothered bringing it out again.",-0.0029873082040420738

1470,1.0,"I rented this because of the comparison to Oblivion on the back. Now I want to the guy who wrote that deceitful review and find out how much he was paid for it.

I returned it the very next morning. I'd put maybe fifteen minutes into it the night before, and ejected it in disgust.

This game pretends to have character customization. It'll let you shorten or lengthen your character's arms and legs, and give him muscles. That's about it. Oh, you can change hair color. There are a couple styles, but they all pretty much look alike. And that's it.

I thought maybe it would redeem itself--after all, Fable could be rather linear but it was great--but when I watched the first cutscene I groaned. It was terrible. I could tell someone spent all of five minutes on it before shoving the product on the shelves in the hope of making a few bucks before gamers caught on. The characters looked wooden and the voice acting was the worst I've heard in years. The writing was almost as bad. Imagine characters who sound like they're reading words off a medical chart while going out of their way to sound medieval.

Example:

""Hail, my lord! Art thou the bounty hunter that wast summoned by mine village elder?""
""Aye, that be I. Where be thy village elder that I mighte speakethe with himeth?""

And so on and so forth. It's friggin' painful. And the subject matter is so incredibly generic I can't...actually, that about does it: incredibly generic.

In the first dungeon--which I think is supposed to be a tutorial--I encountered two enemies. The first in the game! Ask any gamer--the first enem(ies) a game throws at you are always set up to be impossible to lose to. The game just wants you to get your feet wet, test the controls.

Not here. I died seven times trying to kill the first enemies in the game. Two hits from them was enough to kill me. It was like the game accidentally dropped me in the final dungeon instead of the first.

Finally I managed to kill them. I don't know how, because the controls are so loose it's nigh impossible to keep your crosshairs on the target. Pure luck, and lots of respawning nearby. Oh, I forgot to mention that--that's six or seven deaths with my cumulative damage still on those two baddies. If this was a foreshadow of the kind of ridiculous imbalance I'd see later on, it was a bad, bad sign.

My next challenge was opening a locked gate. I found my lockpicks on the menu (the horrible, horrible menu) but couldn't figure out how to use them on the gate.

The menu graphics look like they were imported directly from a Sega Genesis. It's half impossible to tell what things are in your inventory, and all of the menu commands are counterintuitive--except looting. I figured out how to use potions. That was a major victory.

This game pretends to be like Oblivion--hence that schmuck's comparison I mentioned--in that there's an overworld with several locations you can find and explore. Also, you can buy a horse. And that about does it for those similarities--but I had to mention them, because the game throws them in your face.

I'm very glad I only rented this and didn't purchase it. If I had, I would've demanded my money back.

3) Its motion sensing feature is a gimmick. It sounds good on paper, but does not work in reality. You'll barely turn or not a all no matter how much you move around the controller.

1492,1.0,"Yet again, another Call of Duty game is released.  Yet again, we have those same boring action-packed trailers and commercials showing BS reviews from websites they probably paid to give their games a good review (ever hear the story of a former IGN employee saying they get paid to give games good reviews?)  And yet again, people ran out to buy Black Ops 2 because they had to have it.  No one learned a lesson from the horrid excuse of a videogame that was Modern Warfare 3, from the lies including the exclusion of death streaks to the fact that there were moments when the game literally froze online on the PS3 version.  Modern Warfare 3 had the worst netcode (save Uncharted 3 which is plain abysmal) for an online shooter I have ever seen.

THEN comes Black Ops 2.

I didn't even bother with the campaign of Black Ops 2 save for the first two levels.  And those levels were THE EXACT SAME THING FROM MODERN WARFARE 3.  You start off in a warzone shooting countless enemies.  Sound familiar?  How about the fact that you're randomly told to use some aerial weaponry to destroy more targets on the battlefield?  Sound familiar now?  THEN the second level takes you to rescue Frank Woods, where you must sneak past the guards, hoping to remain hidden in the grass, until you later blow your own cover by causing an explosion.  If that doesn't sound familiar, then you have never played a Call of Duty game before in your life, because it is the exact same style of campaign used in Modern Warfare 3, 2, and 1, with MW1 being released in November 2007.  Yes, that game is five years old.

But why would anyone in their right mind play a Call of Duty game for the singleplayer?  It's all about the multiplayer, right?  Right.  So, of course they're going to make their selling point as polished as possible.....I'm sorry, I couldn't say that with a straight face.

I'll be nice and start off with the things Black Ops 2 did right.  FINALLY we are allowed to customize our own classes however we want.  It's called the ""Pick-10"" system, where you get to pick ten items of your choosing and place them in your class.  Do you want to only wield a knife?  Clear your primary and secondary weapons and you'll only have a knife.  Don't care about lethal and tactical items?  Get rid of them.  Want to use six perks?  You can use two of each, meaning you can use two perks from ""Perk 1"", and so on.  To give a better example of a possible class, one of my favorite classes is the FAL DSW with Primary Gunfighter wildcard (allows three attachments), select fire (choose between semi-auto or full-auto), red dot sight, fast mag (the new Sleight of Hand), and gold camo.  So out of the ten slots available, the gun takes 1, the wildcard takes 1, and each of the attachments take 1, meaning I have 5 possible choices left.  I usually go Ghost for Perk 1, Scavenger/Toughness for perk 2, and Tactical Mask for perk 3, using another wildcard so I can have two Perk 2 slots.  Remember, I only had five more slots.  Perk 1 took up a slot, the wildcard took another, Perk 3 took up a slot, and both my Perk 2's took up a slot.  That's all 10 slots taken care of.  There are literally millions of possible class options for you to choose from, meaning it's almost impossible to see two players using the exact same class.

Another thing they did was change how Prestige works.  Before, every time you prestiged, everything was reset.  NOW when you Prestige, everything is locked again except for your gun camo and whatever you decide to permanently unlock.  You also are allowed to obtain a complete refund of your unlock tokens, add another Create-A-Class slot, or to completely wipe EVERYTHING (stats, camoes, etc....literally everything) and start all over as if you put the game in for the first time.  Prestiging is a little easier considering that, for example, if you Prestige, you get to add a Create-A-Class slot AND unlock an item permanently.  So if you were level 15 with the AN-94 before you prestige, and you decided to unlock it after you prestige, nothing with the weapon will be reset unless you Prestige that weapon, which only unlocks a Calling Card should you complete both Prestige levels for a particular weapon.

I wish I could say there were more things I liked about Black Ops 2 considering the first Black Ops wasn't that bad of a game, but unfortunately, that is where the fun ends.

Let's start with everyone's favorite topic when it comes to Call of Duty, lag.  Because, yet again, they refuse to use dedicated servers, your connection depends on the host's connection.  So if for some reason the host has a ridiculously high ping to his/her nearest server, you're going to experience even worse lag.  To make matters even worse, this game features lag compensation.  Let's say that I have a very-fast 25MB connection and I'm playing against someone that has 3MB.  In reality, my connection is miles better than the other person, meaning I should have every advantage in the world when playing online......except in Black Ops 2 because lag compensation makes the person with the faster connection suffer so the person with the slower connection won't experience as much lag as they normally would.  Now why would I pay hundreds of dollars a month for an internet connection, only to hop on a game that treats me worse than the person with a slower internet connection?  What is this, opposite day?  It's as if Black Ops 2 is trying extra-hard to make average and below-average players even better at the game.

Another problem with Black Ops 2 is the map design, which surprisingly is much worse than what we saw in Modern Warfare 3.  There isn't a single map where you can't find a dark corner, or a ledge to exploit the head glitch (granted the head glitch is in basically every shooting game), or a position that's higher-up on the map to camp from.  EVERY single map has multiple places where you can sit there, hide, and wait for someone to run past you so you can get an easy kill that you wouldn't get if you had to rely on reaction time and a proper aim.  To make matters worse (I'm going to be saying that a lot in this review), if one of your teammates pushes the opponent's spawn, the opponent will then SPAWN BEHIND YOU.  So you could have five people waiting for the opposing team to walk by, but have one person push their spawn, causing them to flip, meaning now the opposing team is running behind you and is shooting you in the back.  And you'll never know this is happening unless you either pay very-close attention to the mini-map or have a UAV/Orbital VSAT (Blackbird from Black Ops 1).  Speaking of killstreaks, they have a new name in Black Ops 2.  They're now called Scorestreaks, where instead of requiring a certain amount of kills to use them, you now need to earn a certain amount of points to do the same......however, this is almost completely irrelevant if you're playing Team Deathmatch because you can only get points for kills, destroying enemy equipment (worth less than kills) or assisting your teammates that got a kill (again, worth less than kills).  So they basically work the same as they have in TDM, except they have a new name.  However you can earn more points in objective-based games considering that, for example, capturing a flag is worth more than getting a kill, and racking up kills with a ""Scorestreak"" is only worth around 25 points per kill.

The absolute worst part about Black Ops 2 is the hit-detection.  Modern Warfare 3's hit detection was pure garbage online, but Black Ops 2's hit detection is pure garbage, period.  Whether you're playing Combat Training offline or playing online with others, the hit detection will fail 9 times out of 10.  The sad thing is it'll even show in the final killcam, when the action is slowed down to better show how the person got the final kill.  OH!  Fun fact about the final killcam, if you're playing an objective game, the ""Final Killcam"" is really the final kill from someone on the winning team, so it doesn't matter who truly got the last kill.  It only matters if they're on the winning team.  So much for FINAL killcam.

After playing this game for a week, I decided to give offline Combat Training a try.  I was so sick of the horrible hit detection and lag, I wanted to see if Combat Training would be any better.  Shockingly, the same issues I saw online WERE THE SAME ISSUES I SAW OFFLINE.  That means that the horrible hit detection isn't solely because of lag.  It also means that shooting at someone that really isn't there also can't be fully blamed on lag.  THE BLAME FALLS ON THE GAME ITSELF.  This is literally something built into the game from the beginning.  Whenever I tried to shoot the horrid AI, my first three or four shots would not register.  So I'm sitting here, firing six shots at an object that's not even moving, only to have the last three shots register and kill the target....that's not even moving.  God forbid they decide to move, because the auto-aim will literally track the target until they go behind a wall, and even then the reticle will follow the original target for a few feet while they're moving BEHIND A WALL.  Yes, make an insanely easy game to play even easier.  This actually makes quick-scoping insanely easy as well, with the only problem being, of course, the horrible hit detection.  I tried using a sniper rifle in Combat Training so I can learn how to quick-scope, and I was getting headshots on the bots without actually aiming for the head.  To add insult to injury, when I then tried to do the same thing online, I got the last kill in on Raid, which resulted in a headshot even though the game didn't say it was a headshot.  The final killcam showed me aiming for the guy's head, which is the only thing I could see thanks to the head glitch, fire, hit him in the head, and yet the game didn't declare it as a headshot.  So how is it possible that I killed someone and didn't hit them in the head, when I hit the guy in the head?

Another thing I noticed in Combat Training was the spawns.  Remember when I said earlier that it's possible for the enemy to begin spawning behind you?  Well I played Free-For-All in Combat Training just to see how bad the spawns really are.  Thanks to the Orbital VSAT, I noticed that a shed behind me was a spawn-point.  When I say behind me, I mean me turning 180 and walking five steps forward puts me in the shed, yet if I make ANOTHER 180 and walk five steps forward, the enemy will spawn behind me, meaning all he has to do is look right, let the auto-aim lock onto me, and hold the trigger.  The best part is someone will spawn around the corner from THAT guy, and ANOTHER guy spawned on the opposite side of a house I was walking through.  That's three enemies spawning within a two-second sprint from my location, in Free-For-All.  I don't think I should have to explain why this is a bad thing.

You know what's really fun about Black Ops 2?  That moment when I shoot a guy in the shoulder with the DSR, a 1-hit kill weapon so long as I hit the stomach, chest, head, and shoulder, only for that person NOT to die.  I also enjoy shooting people six times with a shotgun at close-range in order for them to die, THEN turn around and kill another person at the same range with one shot.  I love shooting someone point-blank with a shotgun only for them to walk away complaining of a headache.  I love the ludicrous amount of flinch when shot, which completely throws off my aim and causes my shot to land above the head if I originally aimed at the guy's torso.  I love shooting at a guy that's right in front of me, only to die and watch the killcam say that he actually moved to my left when he killed me.  I love how every single time you fire your weapon, regardless of connection quality, the game will lag behind the initial pull of the trigger.  In other words, your ammo notification won't recognized a fire shot until a few milliseconds after the bullet has left the barrel.  Does any of this sound familiar to you?  To me it does.  It sounds like Modern Warfare 3, a game I gave 3 stars on the PS3 version (really 2.5 stars), except this came out a year later on a console best-suited for a Call of Duty game, and is at least twice as bad.

People, seriously, stop buying Call of Duty games.  They're only getting worse every year.  Modern Warfare 3 was better than this, which had worse hit detection than Black Ops 1, which had worse hit detection than Modern Warfare 2, which had worse hit detection than the masterpiece that was Call of Duty 4.  It is the exact same experience, every single year, THAT MANAGES TO GET WORSE EVERY YEAR.  Why are people lining up in the hundreds to fund a franchise that gets worse as it gets older?  Would you keep buying an iPhone if it dropped more calls and performed worse every single year?  Would you keep buying Hondas if they broke down and were slower and lost features every year?  Would you keep going to the same fast-food restaurant if the food tasted worse ever single year?  No?  Then why do people continuously buy Call of Duty titles every year?

Go look at all the one-star reviews and look at how detailed they are.  Then go look at the vast majority of four & five-star reviews and look at how vague they are.  A lot of them sound like they were written by a 12-year-old that failed fourth-grade English.  Don't fall for the hype.  Save your money.  Go buy Borderlands 2, or Far Cry 3, or even Battlefield 3.  DICE can't ruin that game no matter how hard they've been trying (believe me, they've been trying).  Go buy any other game that doesn't have Call of Duty in its name, so you'll finally know what it feels like to get your money's worth.",-0.014853858117800196

The game has beautiful graphics, sounds and an acceptable storyline. But the controls and the fighting system kills all that. There are also slowdowns in the game and several graphic bugs.
I only played 3 levels and then I rage quit and never played the game again. i watched all of it on youtube. it's better than playing it, trust me.

***Spoiler Alert***
I passed the following levels: Nightmare, Missing persons and I reached the hotel(first boss, Sepulcher).
After getting over the crappy fighting system, slowdowns and graphic bugs, I was excited to fight the damn boss.
While I was trying to hit the meat sacks of the boss, the game targeted the boss itself and NOT the meat sacks. Ok, I dealt with that and I destroyed all 3(or 4) meat sacks and the boss fell on the floor. The next step, you have to hit his hands so he will collapse and you will hit his head and kill him. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT. I couldn't target his hands, I was walking THROUGH his hands, he could hit me but I couldn't harm him. I was swinging the axe into the air and COULD NOT HIT THE BOSS OR HIS HANDS. After about 10 attempts, youtube and walkthrough checks, I rage quit and I threw the game away.

I read many positive reviews of this game and thought it sounded great - free-form exploration would be great for my daughter (8 years old) who loves the sea & sea creatures (as do I).

Before letting you just jump in and explore the water like it should, you have to sit through endless text (two lines at a time and hitting ""A"" to advance it just like games in the 80's) telling you about the game & how to play (which really needs very little explanation).  My daughter kept saying ""I want to just swim around"", but the intro stuff was so long & boring.

Kids who are not very good readers will need a parent sitting with them explaining things also and even good readers will not understand many of the words.

The game then tries to give you a series of tasks via your email -- to check bring up the menu, select ""return to boat"", click on the boat cabin to enter, click on the PDA, click on the email, then read.  Why so many steps for such a core part of the game?  Also, if this is a free-form game about exploration, why is it giving you tasks right away?  The first few tasks seemed very dull also such as ""map the lagoon"" rather than fun things like ""find a shark"" or ""feed a dolphin"".

In the water in our 45 minutes of play we saw a few fish, one ray (briefly) and nothing else.  No other sea creatures at all.  My daughter kept saying that she wanted to see sharks, dolphins, sting rays, etc.  Maybe you have to unlock cooler creatures, but why if this is mostly a free-form exploring experience?

To learn the name of a fish you must ""touch"" it repeatedly, some as many as 8 or 10 times.  This is certainly not my idea of fun and nor would kids put up with it.

Maybe we didn't devote enough time to the game to get the full experience, but when it's not fun why bother?  Why should I have to keep pressing a button while pointing to a fish to learn its name?  We tried 4 different locations on the map and they were all very similar.",0.0187130407718643

1497,1.0,"I found the game very ""easy"" to play (that is, if I get to play it, since the infamous Error 37 is the biggest threat in the game) and not, for my part, innovative at all. Having played many RPGs like Mass Effect, Dark Souls and Dragon Age lately, I have expected Blizzard to somehow come up with a more thrilling story and more compelling action sequences. However,I feel like I am repeating myself over and over to the point that I can get over it all by using just one hand. Don't get me wrong, I still am a great fan of Diablo 2, and am not comparing the franchise directly with the other RPGs out there, but still, they could have done so much more in the time available, especially after having seen what is going on in the gaming world. That, of course, is my humble opinion. Back to D2, I guess (Error 37 forces my hand anyway :p )

Edit (5-6 days later):
After the patch 1.0.2b, the game became unplayable as error messages followed one after another. I am forced to exit the game, and then try to reboot, and voila... The same error message again! All this, after an update. Seriously, Blizzard: After such a long time spent programming this game, how can you mess it up so badly? After all, I CAN NOT PLAY THE GAME I PAID 60 BUCKS FOR! I really am very disappointed with this game and Blizzard, and having read many forums, I know there happen to be a LOT of people who have run into the same sort of problems and feel the same.

Take time to read the good, bad, and ugly reviews alike to form your own opinion.

Essentially this is an RPG game where every step you take will be watched by Blizzard - and realize that this is not the old Blizzard that made good games.

Essentially you build up characters and have very limited trade with others in the game - so get used to playing alone.

Once you overcome the fact that this is an equipment based game by getting half way decent equipment then Blizzard will change everything and your equipment will be obsolete.  Your pants do more damage than your character to give you an idea of how weak the characters are.

You can only play online with Blizzard watching you to make sure that you are doing what you are supposed to do when your supposed to do it.

You will eventually start playing other games and steer clear of Blizzard and feel better. So if you eventually want to feel better  - then buy this game. If you want to feel better now - buy something else.",0.013576721977357186

Maybe it's a problem with the Playstation controller or maybe it's me, but even after ten hours of playing I found it difficult to control and move the character around. The camera control leaves much to be desired as well: sometimes the perspective changes at the most inopportune moment.

At several points in the game you have to pick up and throw stuff at objects or even bosses, which I found very difficult because of the over-sensitive controls and the lack of a scope or any sort of targetting device or target zoom & lock.

On the positive side, the storyline is easy to follow even for a hapless PS3 novice like me. You don't get stuck somewhere because you neglected to pick up an item two levels prior (or have to backtrack to get it). I played the scout and liked her combat moves, although you don't seem to have to aim at any particular opponent; you just, well, hack and slash away at it.

Thankfully I waited a bit and only paid $20, which in my opinion is still a little much for this particular title. The graphics are certainly not as good as they could be. Fine I guess I could deal with that. An accurate way to describe this game is an interactive movie with puzzles. You can't make a wrong move. If you do, you die. Simple. What gets on my nerves are these little mini games that they added so you actually think you're doing something. They are simple puzzles in the sense of figuring out what to do but really frustrating.

The controls are very difficult to get used to as well. Personally I get dizzy when it's required to move him in first person. And the gun use is not accurate at all. As long as you shoot in the zombie's general direction you should be good. But you do need to stop fighting, (and during this time you are getting attacked) take out the gun, switch to first-person, aim, and finally shoot. Not to mention how hard it is to drive the stupid cars with the Wii controls.

The save points are another thing that kill me. It only saves at the most inconvenient moments. Right before the loooong cutscene, or right before a series of jumps you need to make before something falls on your head. And you can't save it on your own time. I don't even know why it has a save option in the menu.

The 3-D graphics aren't that bad at all in this game. Surprisingly their pretty good.  We get to watch a 3D anime scene at the start and it's pretty cool.  But that's about as far as eye-candy goes. Without a doubt more animations and such could've been put into the graphics.
I can't say much for the sound.  A lot of it is pretty bad and while it hits the action notes, it just doesn't work.  The voices (in english anyway) are very horrible.  The sound effects are cool though, but that doesn't mean the sound is all that great.
The gameplay almost saves this game and actually gets it the two stars it deserves.  The gameplay is simple, just like always.  When you select to go to a level you now get to choose two of three characters. Either X, Zero or the new character Axl.  You're allowed to switch between the two characters as you like. As you might have guessed, Zero is the strongest of the three and he uses a Z-Saber (Think of a lightsaber from Star Wars if this is your first Mega Man X game).  Axl is a new character who has the ability to float in the air if need be for a short while (like Peach in Super Mario Brothers 2).
While the gameplay is good it is quite a difficult game, like many other Mega Man X games it takes time to get used to.
The story actually focuses around Zero and Axl.  There really is no real plot in Mega Man X7, it's the same old select between eight bosses until you get to that final encounter.  Short game as always.

The gameplay is routine but decent.

The story is nothing short of a cliche-ridden travesty with a terrible ending.

It's as if the creator just Googled words like ""psychology"", ""dementia"" and ""insanity"" and just formed a story from the first wiki article he read. No actual research was done and the game comes off as incredibly amateurish and actually somewhat embarrassing. Unless you pay more for DLC, character arcs are left unresolved and the entire experience comes off as unfinished.

Another issue are the recycled boss fights. The initial encounters with the main three villains are intensely fun, but you literally have to do each about three times each. This not only ruins a sense of completion and victory, but also hinders the already insipid plot further by showing you kill these enemies--then having them inexplicably come back to life. It ruins tension and excitement when for the nth time, the same boss appears repeating the same mechanic again and again and AGAIN.

1516,2.0,"I was originally excited about the PSP Go when I first heard of it; I thought it could be a great portable console like the PSP had been for me. PSP despite some early criticism got better and had some cool features and some good games that made it worth it for me. I thought I could expect something great right away from the new version, the Go, Boy was I wrong.

On the positive side the Go looks great and feels great, it is much lighter than the original PSP and a little lighter than the 3000 version. I like how it slides, its size, games play nicely with the controls and I think it's comfortable.  The screen is smaller than that of the PSP but looks really good. You can change the internal memory to that of a 32 GB and I'm sure eventually you will be able to buy even more memory. The fact that you can buy the games online and get them on your Go is nice (but it takes too long! waiting 30 mins-1 hour for the PS store to PSP Go is painful!). You can also upload videos and music which is great (wait couldn't the PSP already do these last two features?). ""Mini"" games don't cost much and are fun. It definitely has a lot of potential to it.

Nothing really justifies how it can be priced higher than the PSP. It has 16 GB internal memory which is not bad but what If I want to keep all the games I buy on it? I have to delete some of the ones I already have and then if I ever want to play them again I need to repurchase them? Or how about buying games and not being able to know if they're any good? The fact that PSP Go games that you don't physically own cost more or as much as a PSP game when it really shouldn't is a turn-off.  You can't exchange or sell the game either which is not a good thing as of now, if you don't like a game you buy at least you can get something for it even if it is minimal, with the Go forget it! You paid enough for the system and now you have to buy downloads for 40$ (there are ""mini"" games which you can buy for 5-10$ and some are really fun but it's an entirely different thing than a big game)? Also the Go doesn't have as good of an infrastructure as Sony would want you to think, it is likely to get better but for now it doesn't offer a lot and  there aren't that much games available. You can get some PSP titles which is good but with the PSP library of games you'd think there would be more available, it isn't the case yet but they released some big ones like God of War and newer PSP games are available on the Go.  I was also disappointed in the fact that it isn't compatible with PSP games and UMDs, when  a new game system comes out I think the ones buying it have come to expect this from consoles who have retro compatibility ( Wii, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360 and even the DS ) so why not the Go? Having a new console is nice but it doesn't mean throw away the previous one just yet! The battery is not replaceable in the sense that you can't remove it or replace it yourself which is unfortunate if you ever come to experience problems with it.

I would keep my PSP for now instead of buying a Go. I'm not saying the Go will never be worth it but for now it's not unless you know you really want one or if have the money to experiment with or risk. I've owned a PSP since 2005 and still enjoy it and I don't see why you would NEED to switch to Go yet. Besides Sony has stated that the Go was not meant to replace the 3000 and that they would continue its support. Perhaps just like every console it's too pricey for a launch but this one really is, it doesn't cost a lot less than a PS3 (50$ approximately)! You can still buy and play games on a PSP, download stuff and it doesn't cost as much.  I'm not a hater, I like what it CAN do and the system itself is great but when it all comes down to the thing that is price, then it's too expensive overall.  For now if you're buying your first PSP get a 3000 (or maybe older) it won't be as frustrating and it's probably best for now as the PSP is still a good portable console.",0.041981402345806086

Space combat is pathetic so don't buy this game if that's what you were hoping to do. You can only fire directly forward with your laser . . . or your other laser. Forget strafing, or locking on to a target. The enemy flies directly at you firing, then flies under you, then turns for another pass as you turn too. You both turn over/under each other, end up behind one another and repeat the process for as long as takes until you realize the best strategy is to stay perfectly still, or turn the game off.

I gave two stars instead of one because it's an okay game; if you've missed the hype of what was meant to be. Compared to the 5 star hype offered, this game wouldn't warrant a half star. I do like the fact that this is a relaxing game; there aren't many of those. Walk around and explore the planet and animals for some distraction without being shot at or fire bombed.

There are occasional glitches (graphic freezes and graphical anomalies such as your character singing into an invisible microphone) and it just feels like not much work was put into it. It just isn't nearly as much fun as Rock Band, and the pitch recognition in Rock Band is a lot more accurate. The biggest problem with this game is pitch recognition - at the low end of my voice the game just doesn't respond accurately, no matter how I adjust the mic settings. There's also quite a noticeable delay between singing and hearing your voice through the TV speakers, something that is inexcusable for a karaoke game. These are all thing Rock Band got just right, so why is this game so buggy?

The real American Idol judges all provide their voices to this game but the character models look eerily lifeless. You'll quickly start getting repeated comments. While fun at first, the American Idol schtick does start to get a bit tiresome, although thankfully there is an option to just sing without hearing the judges at the end.

On the plus side, there is a good selection of songs (mostly pop/rock) and plenty more to come via downloadable content (42 available as of March 12th 2008). You can customise your characters' costume with loads of outfits and there are quite a few ""venues"" where you can sing. There are a few unlockable videos of actual American Idol song clips and interviews with the judges about the game.

1520,2.0,"I've loved all of the games in this series, and I have to say that Ascension is probably the weakest of the 4 games that have been released on consoles (I'm not including the PSP versions, which I haven't played). God of War 1 and 2 on PS2 are really great, and I was much looking forward to PS3 graphics for the next game. GoW3 came out and I bought it and played all the way through it day 1. I absolutely loved it, and it was graphically beautiful. The story flows well from 1 to 2 to 3, and I was wondering what they were going to do with this game.

GoW:A is a prequel to the first game. During the first couple games they explained Kratos' back story very well, so I don't really think this was needed. There were some cool concepts in GoW:A, and some pretty visuals, but the story kinda fell flat. I think they ended up spending too much time focusing on the multiplayer aspect that they tried to incorporate vs just focusing on the core 1 player experience, which is the main reason GoW fans love GoW games. If there's ever a 4th game released, I hope they don't make that mistake again. It seems like hardly anyone gave a crap about the multiplayer aspect, and in the making of videos it seems like that's what they were spending all of their time trying to push.

As a collector's edition the game is kinda weak as well. The statue that comes with it isn't very good in terms of quality. The arms are separate from the body and come detached inside the packaging. They just sort of plug on to little plastic posts. It doesn't look the best in terms of detail either. Just like at toy that you'd get at the store, but with no points of articulation at all. The game also comes with an aluminum game case for the disc itself, which isn't too bad - better than a standard plastic case, but isn't anything special either. This collector's edition, as a package, and especially compared to games from companies like Xseed, NIS, and Namco, is weak. Just buy the non collector's version, which I believe now you can get for around $4 used at Gamestop, and play through it.

Better yet, get the HD remasters of the first two games for PS3, as well as GoW3, which is also cheap, and play those. They're a much more enjoyable experience than this. I hope if they release a PS4 version they go back to focusing on a solid story and single player experience and don't waste time with multiplayer again. If they do another collector's edition, a soundtrack disc and a large, full-color, hardcover art book would be cool, since so much of the art in the GoW games is awesome.",0.038333442237904476

that sounds like a real stupid reason to hate a game but it's so extreme in tone with the past sort of snarky, wacky ultraviolence of vice city or san andreas that it often feels less like playing a video game and more like a dysfunctional family/suicide simulator.

saints row series goes the direction of over-the-top wacky fun. gta series goes in the complete opposite direction and it's making me miserable like no other video game does. it's painful to try to get through.

The planes respond sluggishly.
Enemy planes appear fast and turn on a dime while your plane is clumping along about to snap apart at a very slow speed.
Enemy planes zoom past and are in the distance in seconds even when you are flying at top speed.

My enjoyment comes from the story and playing the campaign. It feels like I payed for an entire function of a battle net that won't use to often anyways.

If you like multiplayer and playing short campaigns you will love this game. Then if your like me you will be disappointed by how short the campaign is then be expected to shell out $60 on the next 2 campaigns.

Ubi-Soft never can just make a game simple! You can't just climb a tower, you have to find the one route up a mountain to get to a tower, then, you have to walk a circle around it to figure out how to get to the second story. After that, you have to walk around the second floor to figure out how to get to the third, and so on for ten floors! Get on with it!
The most annoying thing is definitely the animals. On multiple occasions, I've been attacked by a pack of wolves while skinning the tiger that just attacked me. Of coarse, nearly every animal in the game takes multiple head shots to kill, even when it's five wolves, which is a problem compounded by the fact, even by Ubi-Soft standards, The shooting on this game is just awful. On most Ubi-Soft games, it's typical to aim right at the guy's head and end up hitting his shoulder, this game is even worse. Animals even attack you while you're hiding in the bushes trying to sneak up to a guard post so you can take it sneakily, which is about the only way to do it in this game., The combat is pretty bad too.
And while we're on the subject of combat, whose idea was it too make it so the only way to heal is to take 15-20 seconds out of combat(I timed it) So you're guy can wrap a bandage around his arm during which time you can't sprint, reload, or do anything to fight off the dad guys who are trying to kill you? You only recover one block of health when you do it! And they give you six blocks if you earn them, otherwise you start out with two, but the enemy is armed with weapons that can take away three or four block with one hit. Then, as a cruel joke, one of the skills you can earn is faster re-loads. REALLY!? How about faster revives?

1529,2.0,"I purchased the Sennheiser X320 headphones out of a desire for improved audio quality over the normal selection of gaming headsets available.  I have tried three different models of turtle beach, Tritton, Razer, and even Rocketfish.  All have fell short of the audio quality I was looking for.  I want to use the headsets not only for long gaming sessions, but also movie watching. I tested all of the headsets i purchased on several different games and movies to see if they could provide the level of audio quality I required of a headset.  None delivered, but in defense of the Sennheiser's, they did come the closest.

The Sennheiser X320 headset had decent audio quality, not great, but better than I had heard from other companies headsets.  There was just too many negatives, coupled with a defect in the set i got, to allow me to keep these.

The first issue was that the audio could not get loud enough on this headset.  I always had the volume maxed, in games and movies, and always was wanting just a little more.  The volume could be described as adequate, but I tend to like my audio a little on the loud side, and these just could not deliver.  I had better luck in this area with other headsets, so I can only blame the product design. I could basically listen to my 2.1 setup (Logitech Z2300) at the same volume these maxed out on without disturbing anyone else in the house, nullifying a major reason for wearing headsets; gaming at the volume you want without disturbing others. Strike one.

The second issue was the comfort.  These were at the bottom of the list when it comes to comfort.  Just like every other aspect of deciding the overall quality of an item, this is subject to personal taste. These just do not have enough padding on the earcups, and not enough flexibility in the design of the headset.  Rotating earcups might have helped a long way here as I had a hard time getting these to sit just right on my ears and head. Also, I know overly tight headsets might not be comfortable, but these always felt too loose and would move too easily, requiring constant adjustment. Strike two.

The third issue, and reason for me returning these, was an issue with the mic.  The boom is not adjustable in and out, just up and down.  I don't mind the design, but I wonder if it is at fault for the problems I had.  While in chat with other players(in and out of game)I was often being told that it sounded like my mic was cutting out.  I tried adjusting the mics location up and down, but no improvement could be made.  I then put on my wireless xbox headset and the problems went away, pointing directly at either a faulty item or poor design. This was the big reason for return since one of the main reasons for wearing a gaming headset is to communicate with others. Strike three!

Again, to be fair, the audio quality of these was better than any other headset I have tried.  Not good enough to warrant the crazy high retail price of these, but none the less better.  Taking the volume concern out of the equation, the only issue I had with this items audio quality was the imaging.  When you wear a good set of headphones they should project the sound in a way that it seems like the sound is coming from around you, or at least in front of you in regards to a stereo set like these.  These did not provide that.  Everything sounded like it was coming from inside my head thus making everything you see on the screen feel separate from the audio, ruining the immersion. I didn't knock off any points for this as most of the headsets i tried had the same exact problem, but I would expect a much more expensive set like these to be better in this area.

Overall, I just can't recommend these, and even had to give them a slightly negative review.  Considering these cost around two and a half times as much as most wired stereo headsets these just prove to be a bad purchase.  A cheap $60 set of turtle beaches provide 90% of the audio quality at a 250% lower price, even considering sale prices on both.  So, in my opinion, save your money and go with a cheaper brand/model.",-0.025259110876152208

1532,2.0,"The game is okay at first, but there are a lot of annoying things about it.

The reports suck, and it's hard to figure out the best amounts to charge each store at times.  Upgrading sucks because you have to click to scroll through a long list of items to figure out dependencies to get later upgrades, and then click to scroll back to the dependency to research it, and it only shows 1 item at a time.

The roaming employees (janitors, guards, etc.) are idiots.  They do go out of their zones, but they do a horrible freakin job, and I'm constantly torn between hiring more when I don't have the money, or doing the very annoying pick-up and drop maneuver to get them to clean some corner that isn't covered.  The mechanics are even worse -- they NEVER go out of their zone -- AT ALL! So you have to hire dozens if you place objects around the mall, which balloons your payroll... that, or just let the objects sit there broken (which, all of them break FREQUENTLY) and hope the shoppers are as dumb as the mechanics and just don't notice.

Scenario goals are too vague at times (hard to tell when it says ""make $10000"" whether it means have $10000 in the bank, or have a reported net or revenue of $10000.)

Creating a custom store is a terrible experience.

Attempts at building a second story and putting in shops completely ruined my store and turned my clients into zombies.... I STILL HAVE NO CLUE WHY THEY ARE ZOMBIES, WHAT THAT EVEN MEANS, OR HOW TO GET THEM UNZOMBIFIED! and at this point I just don't care... this really killed the game for me after kind of being iffy about it the whole time.

1537,2.0,"Boy, did this game turn out to be a HUGE disappointment for me. Loved the series when Remedy had the reins.... should've known that Rockstar would change things up for the worse.

To begin with, as many other reviews have noted, this game is about 40-50% cutscene. A few of them are interesting and fun to watch, but even these drag on for way too long (sometimes as long as 15 minutes each). Even worse is how some of the longer ones aren't skippable (seriously?) A good number of them are meaningless and add nothing to the story. For example, upon reaching the exit to an area a cutscene will start which shows: Max slowly opening the door, peeking through, walking through the door, carefully creeping down another alleyway or hallway, stopping behind a wall while guards walk by, moving across the road and down some stairs, hiding behind another wall, waiting for a vehicle to drive by, crossing another road, and then dropping into the next area. This is the kind of stuff that the player should be doing. Why in the hell are we sitting here watching the game play itself?

I found the gritty, depressing story mysterious and interesting at first, but once the game tells you what is going on (which wasn't too far into the game), I started losing interest. There's also quite a bit of brutal violence, drug use, dance parties, bikinis, and the occasional racial slur, which confirms that this is a Rockstar game, if you had any doubts.

The graphics are nice, but so what, a lot of games these days have great graphics. The animations are also well done. The voice-acting is top-notch, especially Max, but his lines of dialogue feel really forced this time around. In the previous two games, Max's comments about his environment and situation were snappy and witty, which I generally didn't find to be the case in MP3. Most of the time I found myself just ignoring what he said, which I found surprising as I used to hang on his every word in MP and MP2.

But of course, what really matters is how the game plays and whether or not it is any fun.

Well, if you filter out the excessive cinematics, the rest of the game is basically one giant linear series of rooms and hallways filled with bad guys. There is the occasional on-rails shooting scene (what's new...), but the rest of the game is the same repetitive shooting from room to room. At least the first two games had larger areas to explore like apartment buildings that gave you the illusion of nonlinearity. There's no illusion here: Walk into a room, kill 15 guys, enter the only hallway available, kill 5 guys, enter the next room, kill 12 guys, etc/etc. Every level is the exact same experience, except for a different locale and enemies that take an increasing number of shots to kill. It got really old for me really, really fast. And these stinkin' levels seemed to go on forever, which only added to my exhaustion and loss of interest.

For some reason, the developers also felt the need to add in cover-based mechanics, which is curious, as there really is no place in the Max Payne universe for cover based shooting. However, as it turns out you're gonna need this cover, because the enemies in this game are so effin' accurate you'll be instantly taking damage any time you step away from it. Even in slow motion WHILE MOVING you'll get lit up, which is irritating. Hanging out behind cover and blindfiring is often the best choice when faced with up to 10-15 guys blazing away at you, but even when you do your arms will still get easily hit and you'll fill up quickly with damage. This does not change on lower difficulties (easy/medium), which is dumb.

I also found the controls to be of VERY poor quality for a third person shooter. I tend to enjoy the genre and have no trouble with most of its games. Dead space 1 & 2, uncharted 1/2/3, etc, all have very well- and carefully designed analog responsiveness and control. I don't recall ever having major issues with the controls in these games, even on their hardest difficulty levels (hardcore/crushing), but Max Payne 3 was an absolute nightmare for me. I tried every sensitivity option available and could find nothing that works. Even in Bullet Time I found myself constantly overshooting my aim back and forth trying to dial in my shot. Why some people have this problem and others seem to not baffles me, but I consider myself an experienced player of 3rd person shooter games, and I found the aiming in this game horrendous. Beware.

Other game design flaws include shoot-dodging that is now completely nerfed in that it leaves you openly exposed after landing, with the player watching helplessly as Max struggles to get back up while the army of enemies fills him with lead. A newly added mechanic known as ""last man standing"" allows you to get an instant revive if you can shoot the guy who just ""killed"" you; however, it is not uncommon for an enemy standing 75-100 feet away to be the one who shoots you, which makes shooting him unnecessarily difficult. Alternatively, if an enemy shoots you from your side or from behind and puts you into this mode, you're pretty much hosed as the game only gives you a limited horizontal range to hit your target and you may never even get to reach him. More flaws include a tiny white dot reticule that makes aiming incredibly difficult, particularly against a light color background or when trying to hit an enemy from 100 yards away, a grenade launcher that farts out grenades 10 feet in front of you instead of shooting them 30-40 feet ahead, a useless AI teammate who almost never provides any help in combat, NUMEROUS insta-kill moments that require you to make a perfect shot under time pressure, and widely spaced checkpoints that have you replaying long stretches of gunbattles over and over again. I also still can't figure out why it takes 2 minutes for the game to load the title screen, similar to GTA IV.

And who could forget the numerous glitches, audio bugs, and crashes? I had the game freeze on me 5 different times, each one forcing a complete reset of my PS3. I remember GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption having similar problems. For comparison, Mass Effect 3 (which I had played through right before Max Payne 3) had not a single crash, and that's a big game. I love beta testing a team's game for free instead of having them do the necessary QA work. Nothing a series of patches won't fix after the fact, right? Thanks for crapping out another a half-tested product, Rockstar.

If not for the overall quality of the animations, voicework, and music, I would've given this game one star. There really are some cool set piece moments in Max Payne 3, but unfortunately I was so burned out on playing the same damn shooting gallery experience over and over and dying from boatloads of cheap, divinely accurate enemies, I didn't even care. I think I only smiled once during the entire game, which was in response to Max reflecting that ""he had killed more cops than cholesterol"". And once I saw the short, disappointing ending, I was sorry that I pushed myself to even finish the game. I should've quit on Chapter 3 like I had wanted to. I can't even honestly say I had any fun at all.

I know I'll never buy another Rockstar game, but now I think I may never even rent another Rockstar game.

Nothing really stands out as exceptionally bad, it's just that the whole game has an awkward and clunky feel to it.

The videos really make the keyboard and mouse look fun. And yes, this mouse IS fun. It's a very simple mouse with bright lights and it really does do everything it promises.

However, if you unplug the receiver to plug the mouse in (or vice verse), it will act like you're installing a new device EVERY SINGLE TIME. On top of that, the mouse will reset if you lock your computer (and to make it worse, when you come back from locking it, whatever lighting effect it was last set to will act like it's set to be dim when you get back to using it, and the synapse tool will say it's set to be at its brightest. You can actually set it to ""dim"" and it will be even dimmer. In a well-lit room, you won't even know it's lighting up at that point).

The charger dock has a light of its own, which is cool, and it can be set to match the color the mouse displays. In the rare event it actually DOES decide to match what the mouse is doing, it matches the light on the scroll wheel.

One less-necessary complaint of mine is just that the lighting patterns are not smooth if they're not annoyingly fast or show many colors (or only one). If you set it to cycle the colors through at a speed that won't distract you from what you're doing, and it's only two or three colors, the waves of colors don't flow like you'd expect. It moves in an annoying, choppy way.

Another less-necessary complaint which is slightly my own fault: whatever the grips on the sides of the mouse are, they're not normal, and that's in a good way until someone with greasy fingers touches the mouse without permission. I'm not sure how many times I've wiped it down and dried it, but the grips on the side are still slimy.

It has a certain feel of nostalgia but the fact that whomever answers the most trivia questions correctly is guaranteed to loose just takes the fun out of it.  We have unscientifically proven this by playing many games where one player got every question wrong and still dominated the player who was mostly correct.

I did the same thing with Sins of a Solar Empire, which just goes to prove the old saw about the bear. (Sometimes he gets you and sometimes you crap in the woods ... no, wait. Sometimes you crap in the woods and the bear gets you. Yeah, that's it).

Take time to understand what you are getting into before you buy this game. To me, it was the mutant offspring of a tactical turn based simulation and a fast-twitch real time simulation. Galactic Civilization meets StarCraft meets Homeworld. The results were ugly. You cannot pause. You cannot offer the same diplomatic options to your rivals as they can offer to you. Fleet control is limited. Resources are unlimited, so that the game always devolves into one great big zerg-pit battle. The tech tree is stunted and painfully familiar to anyone who has played just a few space-based games. The graphics are adequate, but it is hard to enjoy what little you can of the space battles as you must hover at a far enough distance to make sure your repair ships haven't decided to play hero and charge the enemy dreadnaught for reasons unknown.

This game was not for me. I enjoyed Galactic Civ and its progeny, so had good feelings toward StarDock.  They have saved a total about-face in regards to the product their company puts out with their OUTSTANDING customer support.  They really bent over backwards to be fair with me and while I didn't get a refund, I was okay with the resolution of my complaint.

1555,2.0,"A lot of reviews of this game were prior to the patch released at the end of last year. I would like say that, even with this patch, I wouldn't recommend this game. It's no longer unplayable, but it's still a drag.

First, the game content. Shadow of Mordor welcomes us back to the world of Middle Earth, in a time after Bilbo steals the ring from Gollum, but before Frodo begins his quest (note that neither of those characters play any role here, but it gives a good timeline). Sauron is beginning his consolidation of power in Mordor, and times are getting tough. Needless to say, this is a pretty intriguing idea, and I wish more LotR games would follow suit here.

You play as Talion, an undead ranger who nominally serves as a slave to Sauron. Unfortunately for the Dark Lord, things don't always go as planned, so your character works to undermine the plans of the Black Tower, seeking vengeance for a murdered family. He is helped by a wraith who seems to inhabit his body. The identity of this wraith is one of the great twists of this game (and it's divulged early!), so I won't spoil it.

Shadow of Mordor is a ""sandbox"" game, meaning you have a large open world with a lot of different quests to choose from at any given time. These quests are given out by various allies and whatnot. Mostly, think GTA here. Much of the game focuses on combat, and there is much to like here. Talion, being a ranger, is excellent at hand-to-hand combat, as well as ranged (bow) combat and stealth. All three play crucial roles in his quest to bring down his nemesis, the Black Hand of Sauron.

There is quite a ton of other stuff to explain here (character development, orc society, mission variety), but let's just say this - the content of this game is vast and excellent, and it's not hard to see, even through this shoddy port, that Shadow of Mordor deserved its accolades...on the PS4.

However, this is the PS3. Obviously, sacrifices have to be made for a port. Initially, this game was unplayable. It froze constantly, and slowed to a crawl almost continuously. However, a 1 GB patch seems to have cured these woes - I haven't had a single freeze in my 30 hours of play.

BUT...15 of those hours were probably looking at a black load screen. The load times in this game are atrocious. It's not that the load screen is THAT long (around 5-10 seconds). It's that the load screen appears every time you do ANYTHING in the game? Want to call up the map? Load screen. Want to dismiss the map? Load screen. Want to see a montage of three outcast slaves that you have to save? Three separate load screens. Calling up the menu. Choosing an option in the menu. Returning to the menu. Dismissing the menu. EVERYTHING BRINGS UP A LOAD SCREEN. You need the patience of Job to put up with this.

The fact is, if you can't make a port that works, don't bother. You aren't doing anyone any favors. I could accept the lackluster graphics. I could accept the frame rate issues (post patch). But the load screens just break up any kind of action you perform in this game. You will need to call up the map a LOT in the game (to mark locations of collectables, or missions, etc.).

Oh - and one more incredibly annoying aspect of this is the following: if you hold R2 while calling up the map (which, if you move in stealth, you'll do a lot), you will just skip the map and go to a particular menu (bringing up another load screen). Unfortunately, there is no way back to the map from that menu. Thus, you have to dismiss that menu (load screen), and recall the map (load screen). It's a natural action, and it will plague players who try to use stealth - I have probably done this 50 times myself.

My advice? Skip this, and pick it up when you get a PS4. If you don't plan on getting a PS4, skip it unless you are a massive LotR fan.",-0.016233275685904137

Then its going to sink in....why oh why did you give into the hype of the wiimote? Does shaking that thing around really make games like Dragon Ball Z and Marvel Ultimate Alliance any better?

1561,2.0,"This is my second review of Smackdown vs. Raw. The first time I reviewed the game I was admittedly very harsh and perhaps over-critical. I only had the game for a day at that point and hadn't really explored many of the features. Now that I've had time to really digest the game I urge those who were nay sayers to take a closer look at the game. One of the first aspects of the game I initially slammed was its skimpy roster. Even though Goldberg and Stone Cold have recently left the WWE, to make a game without them is just bad. However with the improved create-a-wrestler and much more user friendly experience system, the task of creating these (and any other wrestlers you want) is exceedingly simple. Some new additions include the ability to have different attire for matches, entrances and cut scenes and the ability to buy experience points from the Shopzone. This is a huge improvement over HCTP because you had to take every created wrestler through season mode to beef up their stats.

Another easy target for criticism was the much anticipated online mode. I have played this mode several times (with a broadband connection) and must admit there is a lot of room for improvement. I experienced horrible lag in some matches. HOWEVER, the very fact that you can take a created wrestlers online is an INCREDDIBLE!! Some of the wrestlers I encountered spoke volumes for the creativity of fans :smiles::

The new additions to the game (minigames, face vs. heel tactics) bring the game much closer to the feel of an actual wrestling match. Some fans were upset with the disposable nature of the weapons (weapons disappear after several uses) but the power of the weapons has been increased compensate. Finally the graphic models look closer to their real life counterparts then ever before, the sets are beautiful and the voiceovers (though terrible at times) at a new dimension of realism to the game experience.

Overall this newest installment of the Smackdown series has made a lot of new advancements (even if some of them need some work).",-0.01207468903121077

  entire time. There's no actual adjustment mechanism on these(you know the number bands that click as u pull em out).
3: The usb dongle JUST NEEDS POWER, it doesn't matter where it gets power. And ALL IT DOES IS TRANSMIT. It DOES
  NOT pull the sound from the usb's.
4: The sound comes from the RCA cables and sends that sound thru the dongle and thus to the headset
  this concept basically makes these just TV HEADPHONES.
5: They're ""universal"" cuz everything u connect a ps3/360/wii/etc to is a tv and what does a tv have? RCA outlets.
  On pc u just plug the dongle in for power and then plug the 3mm audio jack into the headset socket for sound.

1566,2.0,"Off the top of my head, some comments about the game. Sorry for the lack of organization...

The load times on GT5 are horrible. It is unforgivable to pause for 10-20 seconds between menus. What in hell's name is the software doing?
The menus and navigation design are terrible. It is frustrating, boring, and laborious to navigate them in order to find your way to some kind of race. Is it the intention of the game designers to make this game boring? It's like navigating a role playing game just to get a car on a track. Expect to spend at least 20% of your time navigating menus, 20% driving, and 60% waiting between screens.

When you try to enter a race, if you don't have the right car, do they expect you to take out a pen and paper and start writing down the long list of cars that are acceptable?!? You spend 10 minutes waiting to get to that screen, then they deny you entry. You must then painfully and slowly navigate back to the correct dealership or scour the pathetically organized used-car list on the off-chance you might find one of the allowed cars. The game structure and menus and especially the dreadful music just kill any chance this game had of being fun.

That said, some of these races are entertaining when I finally get to drive a half decent car on a track, but it's like pulling teeth to get there.

The physics are not as realistic as GRID. In some cars they are drastically off.

The crash physics are non existent. Hitting another car sounds like the developers recorded the sound of knocking the mic against a cardboard box.

The graphics are plain weak. Car shadows are seriously 8-bit game system quality. The other graphics look like early 90's high-end system graphics. By that I mean the hardware frame-rate and resolution is there, but the developers clearly had no experience in using all the other techniques evolved over the past 20 years to make things look gritty and real. Everything is unrealistically too clean and smooth - it looks like a computer game. Again, GRID is miles ahead in the graphics department and it's 5 years old now!

I quickly ran into the usual GT game-play-killer trap though... I overpowered my car with upgrades making it far too easy to win. Where's the fun in that? This is the major downfall of the GT series. Driving games should be about driving, not car management. Races should be interesting and challenging, not boring and easy to just pile on upgrades until it out-weights any skill you're lacking vs the other competitors.

I'm so glad I bought this game used. I didn't loose much when my patience ran out and I sold it. I take some satisfaction from the fact that I and at least the next owner will not have donated a penny to the developers of this sub-par game.",-0.016219966296031202

The controls for offensive and defensive situations are great, and the goaltending and fighting controls are better than it's EA rival.  The color is vibrant, the gameplay is smooth, and the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard for a video game (I went as far as to by Dozer's most recent album after hearing their song on this game.)

However, if you get into this game on a long-term basis, its magic begins to end.  I did a few simulations to the end of the season and if the computer had my team win the Stanley Cup, I ended up getting a near $7M bonus towards purchasing player's contracts for the next season.  However, when I decided to play the game out and win the Cup myself, the bonus I received was for $500K... a far cry from what I could have earned had I let the game play for me.

I did recently sign up for EA access though, and when I saw this was free to play on it, I thought, why not run up a few more achievements.

Visually this game is a step up from Madden 15 - which is also on EA access, or I likely never would have tried it either.

Gameplay is not horrible in say franchise or play now. The controls are the same as they have always been - so even not having played in years, I could step right in and there was no learning curve.

Of course, this is meant to be played online, and this is really where it all falls apart.
The matchmaking in the MUT mode (this is where most players spend most of their time) in really nothing short of ABYSMAL.
There is very little chance you will ever get matched against a similarly rated team. And I do not mean by a little - not 5 or 10 points one way or the other, we are talking 30+

You may take a 70-80 rated team out into the pool and get 1 or 2 matches with teams only a few points off from your own. But as sure as the tides are coming in, so is a stretch of games where they match your low rated starter team against someone's squad of mutant atomic overrated supermen.

You can put up a fight, but you never really have a chance - unless you are willing to spend more money or an INSANE amount of time grinding out the more than 1000 MUT scenarios, in which you might obtain a few mutant atomic overrate supermen of your own.

1576,2.0,"Sonic is not all about the speed. I wish the developers of Sonic Advance 2 had understood that. The Sonic games for the Megadrive/Genesis were all platformers that relied as much on exploration and tactic as speed. There were hidden treasures to be found to reward you for exploring the well-designed levels, as well as considerable challenges facing you on your way. SA2 feels more like a roller coaster ride; a fun one, but ultimately that's it.

The basic level in this game is thus. You start with a countdown to 'GO!', at which point you take off at lightning speed unless you try to stop. It's impossible to explore. Even if you try to take but a few steps to explore for hidden treasures, you usually wind up triggering a hidden springboard that propels you down the nearest slide, thus far out of reach of your previous area. How are you supposed to find anything in a game constructed like that? The levels are designed with speed in mind, not gameplay. I have turned the time limit off just so I could explore the very first level for a port to the Special Stage. And after almost an hour of searching, I'd finally had enough. That was just the first stage, too; imagine how hard the other ones must be to find!

This game is all about the speed. It's quite obvious. The faster you go, the bigger a bonus you get at the end of a level. All boss fights take place while Sonic is running, and I admit that that is where the speed is an innovative feature, building on the first Robotnik boss battle in Sonic & Knuckles. For every other Robotnik fight, you rescue one of your three companions; Cream the rabbit, Tails and Knuckles the echidna (whose character is completely negated by having him been duped by Robotnik again). The short cinema screens after each of these battles are a welcome touch.

In fact, where Sonic Advance 2 shines is in its style. There are a lot of interesting courses; my favourite is an ice world with a city in the background, set during the night. There is also a fascinating hi-tech zone and of course Robotnik's Death Egg, whose battle is the toughest before getting to the final boss. The music is quite good but not inspiring or memorable enough to compete with other Sonic soundtracks. The final boss battle consists of all of Robotnik's battles in one go, plus a very final master robot battle which, in a completely contradicting fashion, brings you to a full stop. It's ironic that the game's final boss should finally wipe the grease off your shoes, but therein lies the challenge; suddenly you must revive your precision instincts from the Sonic classics. You might say it's too little, too late, though.

These are the game's best points. Sadly, Sonic Advance 2 doesn't allow you appreciate it to the fullest, because it just hurls you on at too much speed for you to be able to. It's a game ultimately lacking in any depth to be really rewarding to play. Speed is not what made Sonic great, and his games can't sustain themselves solely on that - Sonic Advance 2 is proof enough. The previous title, Sonic Advance, has a far better idea on what made Sonic great.",0.029621872330900988

Story
I can't really say too many things about the story for the game because it wasn't that great. And don't get me wrong, Mario games aren't much better, but at least you get the gist of it. A princess in dire need for help and a plumber coming to the rescue. It doesn't have to really be like real life but at least something to get you through the game would be good. But in this game, you have the power of a beast in you for some reason and you end up in a town trying to figure out how to leave. You need to find rings in the world to help give you power ups for your beast form. You transform based on the moon if you travel at night. During your regular form you have to talk to villagers to get their problems solved which will help you to taking on missions in the world. The bad part is that most of the times you don't quite get who you should be talking to about missions and then you have drawn out conversations only to realize you are not talking to the right person. They don't do a good job of directing you either so many times you might just end up wandering around without a clue. The story is horrible for a Sonic game and now I see why people don't play Sonic games.

They are completely wonky. Once you are in a mission, they are standard. I played with the classic remote because trying to use the Wiimote on this thing will make you want to break the tv. I don't know why they did that but the controls are extremely loose for the game meaning that you will find yourself looking like you are flying a spaceship using the Wiimote with the joystick connected. Upon using the classic remote, Sonics standard moves are the power ball (where he revs up into a little blue ball and bursts away), and jumping. Playing in the beast mode you have 2 attacks but it really doesn't matter because both attacks yield the same results.

Overall
I can't even bring myself to keep talking about this game. Sega once stood for something. You see the inspiration in many of their old games. But this was a dud. I played Alpha Protocol which was extremely glitchy, but had an amazing story and only got better once you leveled your character up. This game was uninspired. It's like they churned this out knowing that people would purchase it on Sonics name. I hope future games will at least go in a different direction.",0.005547309243370047

1582,2.0,"I guess I'm missing something here, but the game was confusing as hell.  I've played RPGs before, but mostly ones from Squaresoft which aren't as customizable as this one was.  In my opinion, the customization is annoying...it makes the game way to complicated.  I'll put it this way - I've played for over 20 hours and I still don't know how to get my guy to gain a level.  There's just way too many skills and stuff in this game.

The graphics are okay.  If you're not playing on a HDTV, this game will look a lot like a PS2 game.  The gameplay is pretty tedious.  Combine those 2 features and you've got one heck of an overrated game.

One last gripe - and maybe this only occurs on my system - but the graphics ""skip"" around very frequently while playing.  This was by no means a smooth playing experience.  It seems like they made the worlds too big for the 360 to handle or something, because it skips around quite frequently during normal gameplay.",-0.020884567502214565

1584,2.0,"First off after many complains of this game not being the best RPG as the maker claimed it would be my expectations then became very little.

The story is good. I assume all you know the story of you village being burn blah blah blah...  And also about you either becoming good or evil.

The graphics are just great looking some good stuff.

The voiceovers fit also good.

The music is somewhat bad, well the music fits the game but after playing it for some hours the music just gets a litte annoying.

The controls are really great after some missions I finally mastered the batte system.

Now with all that said let me go with the bad stuff.

The story was great but barely gets good in the last 2 or 3 missions and should have got my attention for the whole game. For example most missions are kill this and rescue that and in the last missions you actually get the feeling that the world of Fable is unique.

The voiceovers fit with the people but come on with the rescue missions they don't have to talk every 10 seconds!! And sometimes I just had to but mute cause of those rescue missions.

The controls work very nicely and also we all should know that in Fable there are swords , axe , bow, etc.  And in battle it was pretty much pressing the X and B button and comeon whats with that!! Even with the spells that make the game better, the maker said we can be whatever we want and I am a big fan of just hacking slashing people but this game makes it so boring-they should look at Ninja Gaiden that was fun cause you had all these combos and stuff to do- this game was rated M so then easily they could have put chopping body parts up and special moves like in your control when you want not just the X then the B button!

And even though there were a lot of various of enemies sometimes it just got plain dumb from the number of enemies you had to fight in a room.

This game is short and I would recommend to talk to everyone and do all stuff cause after finishing this game you might won't replay this game which I am actually doing just cause I am bored,  and cause I lost my Warcraft again.

Verdict: 2.6 out of 5.0 Really fun but has a lot more flaws than I mention so that it can be a game that competes with games like warcraft. This is a must-rent and after you pass and think you are interest probably but it.  But a great game though after all.",0.03645718787138195

1586,2.0,"The Gothic thriller taken to new hype. And in that last sentence there is one word that does not belong: Gothic. DMC 2 is essentially Shinobi Redux. There is no story, no mystery, and little more than pressing the buttons to acheive moves.
Pros:
I strain to find any. But, Disc 2...Lucia's quest is a little better than Dante's. Still has all the cons, though she reminds me of BloodRayne.
Cons:
1. Lack of a storyline, of any kind.
2. The camera angles are so bad that most of the time you are lost or don't know what you are fighting.
3. Dante's modeling is from a far distance and the combat is rhetorical at best.
4. It mimics Shinobi in most aspects. There's the empty city, deranged tanks and even copies of those hated dogs from Stage 3-A.
5. The swordplay was taken directly from Onimusha & Onimusha 2, it's that obvious. But, in this game...the sword will get you killed. It's all guns, no glory.
6. Dante is slow. He runs through the city in a crawl-like way and it takes forever to get from one place to another.
7. The beginning takes a lot from Tomb Raider and is quite pointless. You don't know where you are in this game and there's nothing to find.
8. It takes forever to power-up and there's not enough enemies in a single mission to get you the orbs to power-up.
9. The attack method is not similar to the original and The Matrix stunts won't get you the high demon rank.
10. Graphics. Twice the graphics, huh? The graphics can't hold a candle to Onimusha 2 in gameplay. The cutscenes aren't anywhere near Onimusha (1 or 2)and there is a scene where Dante slides down a pipe - similar to Final Fantasy X, though far less impressive. The main gameplay is reminiscent of BloodRayne...though...not in its league.
Ok, I gave you 10 reasons for the my point. Capcom has been in a frenzy to produce so much this past year and ahead with Resident Evil Zero, RE 1 remake, and RE 4. The company has given us high quality games such as the Onimusha series, the original Devil May Cry and others. This leads me to believe that this DMC was overhyped and underdeveloped.
This wasn't intended as a bash review and I didn't want to write it in that way, honestly. I looked forward to this game for so long. My suggestion is that you rent this one first, see if you like it, and during that week rental...surely you can pick up the game if you are into it. I'm sorry fellow gamers, but the hype doesn't fit the game. This is not Devil May Cry...it's a confusing mess. It is not Gothic, not dark, and holds no bearing to the namesake.
I'll probably get a lot of unhelpful votes from the hardcore, but I'm in the top 5000 reviewers (feel free to check my rank) and I won't steer you wrong.

1587,2.0,"This game is just OK, if you cannot find another basketball game to play. Of course the graphics and the music is great, and also I love all the options you have- you can play the Association, A season, or my player where your created player gets drafted and goes to the league. However, the game is just not realistic for several reasons- #1- there is no way a player can be a 90% three point shooter and not make one three-pointer. #2-there is no way a guy can be drafted to the NBA as a top ten pick in the first round, and also a starter, and not make a single lay-up or a shot directly in front of the basket. #3- the directional buttons are a failure, because you can select the triangle or the circle to throw a direct pass and the computer will make you do otherwise. #4-every time you go for a fast-break or on a run, the Heat button comes up on the screen or what's happening around the league screen comes up in the middle of an awesome play or in the middle of passing the ball #5- the game is supposed to be realistic to the current teams line-ups, why did they have Steve Nash playing for the Mavericks? And Kirk Thomas playing for the Knicks? ((HELLO)) they haven't played for those teams since they first came into the league. #6-the online game playing is fun, but freezes up each time a player leaves the game. #7- it is hard for you and another person to play each other without the controllers getting mixed up- example- I end up being the Laker when I selected the Celtics and my opponent ends up being the Celtics when they selected the Lakers.  Now- the My Player- the one who gets drafted- OH MY!  First of all, you can play your heart out and the game will give you a ""C"". It's like they expect you to play ALL positions. If a Center is passed the ball and your Center does not block him, then it's your fault- the game will tell you that you allowed the shot. Really? I am the point guard. One game, I met all the requests it said to do during the game- make at least 3 jumpshots, limit your man to less than 40 percent shooting. I did all of that and then some and the game said ""Fair"". Even when I was the only player playing defense and offense. Who judges the game, hockey players?  The only reason I keep playing the game is because there are no other b-ball games out right now. I heard some company in Canada took over. Well, all I can say is that, they need to be schooled in B-ball whoever they are. I hope to see more improvements. Like, ""it shouldn't be this hard.""

1595,2.0,"3 Dimensions of Murder is the third installment in the PC version of CSI. As a fan of CSI, I was entertained by the complicated stories, the interaction between suspects, yourself, and CSI agents, and the general feel of the game.

3 Dimensions starts to stumble with the same problems the others had. While I like having to search the scene for evidence and put the pieces together myself, getting through an hour long stage to find I missed a single piece of evidence, or forgot a test and comparison check is frustrating. Having to find that last shred before you could question a suspect or perform a test was incredibly annoying, as you could spot what was coming well before the evidence accumulated to the point that the game decided it was time to advance.

Probably the worst condemnation is the fact that there has been no real improvement despite being the 3rd incarnation. The stages are still run as point and click, and are otherwise not interactive. Its a matter of patiently running your mouse cursor over row after row of pixels to spot the few items on an otherwise static screen, and the almsot snide remarks for your fellow agents when time after time the remark ""Nothing over there. Way to be thorough."" While the zoom in/zoom out camera effects and ""thought play"" you know and love from the show are great, I would've rather had an option to walk around in a basic 3d room, crouch and stand, have a sprite hand that actually open and shut doors and drawers. Aside from the filmed sequences, the only CGI motion is from the CSI agents and suspects, which is dull. The Pheonix Wright games from the Nintendo DS had just as much motion to them as this did.

While I'd recommend this to any fan of CSI, as its a acceptable injection for those of you who desperately need a fix, almost any other mystery game I've played to date can surpass it in almost every category with the exception of movie content and voice acting, which probably got most of the budget. Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes games that go for 2 for 1 deals in the bargain bin have more of what it takes to make a good adventure mystery game.",-0.023536350586022638
1596,2.0,"Shouldn't have trusted a shovelware developer to make a good game. I had this game pre-ordered for quite a while. I saw the videos and the reviews and I loved this game... in theory. I was so hopeful for this game and it received so much hype and glory. However, it does far less than live up to that. In fact it's my most hated game of the year. This is the most frustrating, anger inducing, badly made, and mechanically broken game I've played this entire year. I have played it for a few hours and I'm already getting rid of it. It has zero replay value and the fun wears off as soon as you create all the fun things and have them fight each other. To put it simply this game just doesn't work.

Items in the game: Not everything is in there, obviously. Now you might look at the number of items in the game but that is false. Many items have more than one word associated with it. You could probably cut the list of items down to 1/4 of the actual list by taking out duplicates. There is a large number of items that no english speaking person would ever know or understand. They are mostly food items. Many everyday items are not included in the game. Like pancakes or waffles. In one challenge you have to serve children breakfast. You can't give them waffles but you can feed them raw eggs.

AI: There is none. A maid will sometimes clean up garbage but most of the time just stand there. A truck driver will not drive a truck but just sit in it. Only 3 AI functions exist in the game; protect, kill, and do nothing. Overall the creations are all stupid. Sometimes exterminators will be scared and run from bugs. Sometimes nice animals will just decide to attack other friendly things. Apparently dogs kill cats no matter what. Dog catchers protect dogs not catch them. Animals and people will eat anything remotely considered food even if they wouldn't normally eat it. Their preference is to eat over anything else and they will do it endlessly.

Touch controls: Sometimes if you touch an item the game won't know what you touched and misreads it as you're trying to move. In some cases this will send you into a pit of death or an enemy. This can happen repeatedly. You might be almost done with the puzzle but one slight miss on what you touched and you fall into a pit of lava. Some items you assume can be thrown can't. A few items are so small they are nearly impossible to pick up and will be the cause of your death many times.

Attaching objects: Some objects just won't allow you to attach them. Other objects will show the green dots but won't let you attach to any of them. According to the tutorial in the game it automatically picks the closest attachment to where you have a rope or glue. I have limited success with this since it almost never works.

Logic: This game has none. One puzzle has you start a car. Here's what won't work; a driver, trucker, mechanic, wrench, antifreeze, car key, or pushing it. What will work? Jumpstarting the car with a battery, the pole, or another vehicle. That's it.

Item usage: Many items can only be used once which makes sense unless it's an item that in real life has multiple uses. Some guns can only be shot once or twice then they break. Some items don't do the damage or do things they are supposed to. Things like a boulder won't crush someone or destroy fine china. One time I was riding a tank and it just flew all over the screen and landed upside down, then did it again and again even though I wasn't touching it. Some things like vehicles will randomly explode and kill you. A regular bridge is smaller than a car and won't cover a gap so you have to make 3 bridges and glue them together.

Puzzle hints: One hint is given at the beginning usually a visual hint and a text hint. Sometimes the hints make no sense and are so vague that the puzzle is impossible to figure out without trying everything you can possibly think of. How do you hatch an egg? Hammer? Chicken? Gun? You hatch it with fire. Not only that you hatch the same egg twice and hope the things inside don't kill you before you get the stupid star.

Conclusion: This game could be great but there are so many things functionally wrong with it that make it so unplayable. Almost every single puzzle can be solved with the same 4 items. Nothing is simple and logical but you have to jump through hoops to make the game satisfied that you solved it well enough within conditions. In one case you have to get the king his crown. If he decides to randomly jump in the water you won't get your star even if you give him the crown. He won't always jump in the water and you have to force him back out with a rope or ufo. Honestly if it wasn't for all the hype this game had at E3 I think it would have become a bargain bin title. I wouldn't have bought it without all of the press coverage. These guys make shovelware. Drawn to life was one of their titles and was also a very broken game. I won't be buying their releases anymore. This entire game is just make dumb things to battle each other because no one would actually ever enjoy the puzzles.",-0.0033117753296575177

There's little to no strategy involved in play, just pick your two best weapons and hack and slash through the enemies until you run out of stamina, use a health potion as needed, wait a couple seconds and repeat.  There's a charge feature which makes combat a bit more interesting, but it is learned way too late into the game to save the simplistic combat system.  The inventory system isn't great, limited space in both personal and long term storage, so you can't hoard items, and as you are cash strapped, the game often devolves in running back and forth between shops to sell items.  The inventory system also lacks a sorting feature, so clearing your inventory when it fills up becomes an extensive chore.  As for the shops, they suffer from the typical RPG flaw of rarely having any worthwhile items for your character while being swamped with particularly good items for the other classes (guessing this is to facilitate a trading system for players with xbox live gold, but it should be removed for solo campaigns), though you can cycle the shops inventory by leaving the area and running back until you find something useful, but this gets annoying after repeating a dozen times.  There are no treasure chests on the map, only monsters drop coin and items, and the map is often linear with side passages that have nothing special, so exploration is not rewarded.  Minion type one-hit kill monsters litter the board after you defeat the regular enemies on the map, they're useful for recovering your potion supply but not for much else.  The leveling system is a minimalist joke, there's hardly any choices involved, and learning new skills requires a bounty hunt type quest, often for monsters that don't exist on the maps you're traveling on, so knowing which skills to learn first becomes a task in itself.  Also, as far as I've found, most of the skills are nearly worthless in the game when compared to weapon attacks, and you can't hotmap your favorite skills to the D-pad, so you have to go through the menu each time to switch skills, which certainly breaks immersion.

  The first disadvantage is when you first start the game.  A long ctscene plays, and every two to three seconds, the screen flashes white, which causes splitting headaches for people with eye problems.
  You also must use a keyboard to play, which is extremely difficult; I can't even get out of Hobbiton without falling off a bridge.  The game doesn't support gamepads (special controllers that you can plug in to your computer to play a game), and if it had, the gaming experience would be easier.

1618,2.0,"I bought this game because I had played the first one, and it was fun, funny, and had the right level of challenge. I was looking forward to another cool action/platforming adventure. But that was NOT what I got.

From the very beginning, the lighthearted, madcap-cartoon tone of the first game is lost. Instead, characters are constantly angry, scowling, and generally put you in a bad mood. I hated Jak's new personality. I would rather him be a ""mute"" than this ""angry young man"" type.

In the first game, once you entered an environment, you could wander freely, grabbing Power Cells in any order that you wanted to. Not so in Jak II. Instead, you are given ""missions"". Now, mission-based gameplay is a pet peeve of mine, since I'm used to games where you figure out your objective on your own, so it may not bother people who are used to this type of thing. It does, however, make ME angry.

If the missions themselves were good, this wouldn't matter, but they're not. They're lame and repetitive to a fault. Shoot this...shoot that...beat this time...what happened to the creative objectives of the first Jak and Daxter?

The most grevious issue to me, however, is the controls. In the previous game, the simple platforming and combat let me concentrate freely on my goals. Here, you must use unwieldy guns and vehicles. What is this, Grand Theft Auto? With the vehicles, I was constantly crashing into things. Then the guards would come after me and shoot at me (yet another GTA copy). With the guns, targeting was terribly slow and clunky. I found it easier to just rush the enemy and punch it, which kind of took away the strategy.

I was just so disappointed with this game. After the fun I had with Jak and Daxter, I thought I would have another great series to play. Sadly, I was wrong.",-0.07377692204527267

1621,2.0,"the gfx might be good.... but what good are realistic graphics when the gameplay stinks? This game has amateur-game-studio written all over it....

After playing games like deus ex or nolf/nolf2, which had excellent story as well as multiple ways to complete each level, a game like unreal2 is a joke.
plus there are lengthy loading screens about every 5-10 mins of play....and im on a p4-2.26ghz with 1GB of pc4200 and it takes 1min+ to load levels! I mean max payne had nearly as good gfx in unreal2, but had much shorter loading screens and they were few and far between.... and not to mention in unreal2 u must wait 1min+ just to quick load after you die... it really tests your patience.
on another note, the reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because the introduction movie/ingame cinematic (with studio logos) actually puts you in awe... very breathtaking..... but from there on out the game goes downhill.

1623,2.0,"First of all, I want to say that this is just ""MY"" perspective. Don't read this and get your feelings hurt.

I have been a fan of this series since Halo. It's what prompted me to buy my first Xbox. So without further adieu let's get this started in bullet point format.

Con:

*Weapons are weak, Armor is weak, etc

Elaboration: 343 Like Bungie studios seem to have an erection for ""balance"". But, like the hypocrites they are, that balance goes out the window on Legendary Solo campaign where the enimes can repeatedly ""Show you who's boss"" with their ""OP'ed"" weapons.

If easy and normal, and heroic are going to be a breeze, no matter what, Legendary, should be the starting ground for the weapon builds. Not the other way around.

Rather than focus on making an awesome game truly based on skill, IE aiming ability, it's all more a test of patience you have as a gamer. *duck behind a wall and pray your slow tech shields charge back up fast enough. Pop out, shoot with your weapons that do nothing, die, curse, start again, die.. pop out and shoot.. finally manage to kill one of the eight enemies, who are all elites with super shields. Yay! rinses wash and repeatedly get owned by the AI with god aim and abilities.

For a game where they can build a mile long space ship out in the coldest reaches of space, yet they can't improve basic firearms, or your armor? shouldn't all that metal actually do something!?

*You know that ""Cake is a lie"" thing? your constantly shown the spartans are awesome in videos, but in actual gameplay  you play a  big ol weak character.

-Shields go down at the drop of a pin
-Your killed cheaply and repeatedly
-auto aim you cannot disable.. (this has been a complaint since its existed) so an enemy goes running in front of you while your trying to shoot another enemy, it freaking pulls your aim off! Every dang time!

*The studio thought it would be a good idea that on the station if you throw a grenade and it accidentally kills a scientist, that it kills you automatically..  even though, well you know what happens if you've played the game.

*The Armor abilities are lacking

-Jet pack for instance...  its like a broken pair of wings your handed, it was bad in Halo Reach, but they made it worse in this game.

*Weapons are forced onto you, like a weapon in game, want to use it constantly? Well 343 says screw you! you don't get to keep the gun you like, your gonna use the guns we want you to whether you like it or not. This should have changed by now. Its a garbage set up.

*343 Keeps referring to their game as a sandbox, I think that's limiting in scope. Not something really negative gameplay wise or story.. it's just a bad mentality to have for your game.

*Enemy is just ungodly. I  Already touched on this, but its crazy in legendary.

*You have to complete dorky challenges/level requirements to get new looking armor in Halo4. They had it right in Halo Reach. You fight, you earn credits, you buy your armor. The thing about it was! That the amount of credits you had to earn for the armors, was ridiculously high!

They had it right with more armors for customization. The thing that 343 ultimately forgot about.. is multiplayer is about multiplaying.. not freaking buying armors. So another words.. if you play a decent amount of time.. you should be able to earn all the armors. Then from their, you can get your online look that you want.. and focus on gaming and having fun. I made it up to a pretty high rank from just playing a lot.. but I still could never manage to get all the armors. The amount of credits you earned, or the cost, either way you want to look at it, was ridiculously low/high in Reach. Anyways, the armors in freaking Halo 4 are even harder to get. (don't comment to me if your some god of Halo4. I don't care if you managed to get all the armors, I really don't.. ) Its very frustrating.

*In multiplayer, your forced to wear red or blue.. That's so freaking ridiculous! IT should be all about way points over the characters heads so you got your own look. But your forced into that.

Now the pro's!

+Pelican flight was done extremely well, I never felt like I was fighting to get the gameplay I wanted.
So they did an awesome awesome job here!

+Great great! sounding game. From the guns, to the warthog, and everything in between, the audio was top notch.
(I played with a headset on)

+Beautiful game, graphically.. everything is just so shiny and pretty. A lot of love is their.

+Customizable armors, if you can get them, they have a ton and its wonderful. You can really get a personalized spartan image.

+Gameplay is very well done in multiplayer. I feel that the weapons, even though weak, hit more when their supposed to, a lot more consistency. SO maybe they've improved their ""net code"" or whatever.

The game really hasn't grown with story material or characters.. you don't learn much about Master chief or anything. I was really left with the same feeling when I beat this game, as I was when I played Halo 2 and finished it. That shallow feeling, like they were holding a lot back, and saving it for the next game.

Anyways, if your a fan of the series, go ahead and buy it. It's dropped in price. I would suggest just get the regular version though. I regretted buying the LE edition.

I probably will not be buying the next Halo 5 game. Mainly because the improvements in the game, that should be, are not their. The matureness that should be, is not their. Plus, the story.. it just doesn't make any sense, dealing with a certain plot point.

Mass Effect 3, is a different kind of game, but the story.. is freaking well done, right up until the 3rd game.. They just screw it all to heck at that point. But the Halo series, doesn't even have that kind of story.. it needs so much work, or more from the books needs to be put into the games.. to get that correct ""feel""..

Overall the series has been a good ride, but their were problems with the first game, issues that needed to be improved. And well, its been a hit and mix bag over all..  and they still continue on into Halo4.",0.034032879231789416
1624,2.0,I had it fixed cause it was not working in my xbox360 so i had the game clean so now it works,0.09090909090909091
1625,2.0,"I remember when this game first came out a few years ago.  I wanted it for my PS3, but after the many many bad reviews I saw, I decided to wait until they patched the game.  Around four years later, I decided to finally give it a go and paid $10 to download it from Steam.

I can't even begin to describe how happy I am I didn't blow $60 on this game, but I'm a little said I spent $10.

Need for Speed: Undercover is an arcade-style racing game that takes place in the fictious tri-city.  Bascially, the entire map is of three different cities linked by a massive highway system.  The story involves you, the driver, being undercover in order to dismantle an illegal crime syndicate.  And that's where the fun ends.  Yes, before it even starts.

For one, the game just looks awful.  As I ran the game on high, the street constantly looks like it rained five minutes before the race even began.  This, along with many many aspects of the game, gets old very quickly.  Another thing I don't like is the glaring sun.  The game looks as if it takes place at either an hour or so after sunrise, or sunset.  Never midday, a time point where you don't have to worry about the sun making it almost impossible to not only see where you're going right in front of you, but to also see where you're going on the mini-map.  Because of it's light-blue shade, anytime the sun in the game is anywhere near your screen, you're not going to be able to see it.

The acting is another abysmal part of the game.  It's disappointing that the only thing I actually look forward to in cutscenes is to see how attractive Maggie Q looks, because I can always see that for free on the internet.  Here you'll find your typical, ""I'm trying to hard to be a cool bad guy, so I'm a colossal fail at it"" type of characters.  Your caucasian girl saying ""Dog"" because her boyfriend, who just so happens to be black (oh the irony) also thinks he's a tough guy by screaming into the phone about how he's going to get revenge for beating him last time.  And, of course, you have your ""Oh you think you're tough?  Well I'm tougher.  Just look at how my face gets twisted up!"" characters.  Seriously, EA?  I could've done a better job.....FOR FREE!

But the main thing(s) that kill this game is.....well, the game itself.  The controls have latency issues.  It takes half a second for the car to respond to me turning left or right, but NoS and acceleration, along with breaking, are just fine?  Along with bad controls, the AI is just plain braindead.  And I don't mean braindead as in the game is too easy.  I mean braindead as in they don't have any common sense....PERIOD!  Cut in front of a driver and he'll t-bone you right into the wall.  You don't even have to cut them off.  You could be well ahead, and they'll catch you, spin you out, and another one will ram you even harder.  Just happen to be a few inches away from another driver will cause them to ram you for no reason, no matter how wide the road actually is.  I once started a race and the Porsche in front of me was going in REVERSE........I kid you not.  The car was going in reverse.  Traffic, for some reason, LOVES to turn in front of you, or spawn out of nowhere.  If you're in one lane, traffic will sometimes try to cut you off, even though they're going 60mph and you're going 200mph.  I've also seen traffic literally turn around, travel the wrong way, and hit you.  And the cops?  pfft, laughable.  Doing the missons where you have to steal a car becomes so annoying 80% of the time.  Cop cars will literally, and I mean LITERALLY, spawn right behind you, out of nowhere.  You could be racing, the driver's 10 seconds behind you, your radar isn't going off, they haven't even mentioned the cops being alert to street-racing, and POOOF! there's a cop car behind you.  I've seen cop cars spawn behind me when I've almost evaded them, and they have also spawned in front of me as well.

And one more gripe.  The game becomes too difficult too quickly.  One point, you're destroying everything in a 240sx, and the next, you're sitting in a Tier 3 car and Tier 1's (the highest tier) line up next to you.  So someone, please tell me.  How is a stock Skyline GT-R R34 supposed to beat a tuned Lamborghini Murcielago?  I'll give you a hint: It can't.  They're not even in the same class in real life.  Why make me race cars two tiers ahead of mine?

Need for Speed: Undercover is the exact opposite of Most Wanted, which is based on a similar, epic street-racing, illicit acts, avoid the cops type of style.  Most Wanted had characters that, granted had their cheesy moments, still were at the very least decent and fit the story line very well.  The cops were smart and didn't say ""uhm, they're driving a blue sports car....I think"", they had more dialogue, more believable dialogue, more intellectual dialogue, and the game was a complete blast all around.  It still is six years later.  Undercover, however......honestly, let's not even talk about it anymore.  Yup, it's that bad.  It's not worth pirating because of how bad it is.",-0.010282168727364939
1626,2.0,"This game has poor graphics. The storyline, dialog, and voice acting are all very lame. The music is unremarkable. The gameplay, while fast paced, I found mundane.

This game is a hybrid of sorts between an adventure game with JRPG cliches and a fighting game such as Street Fighter or King of Fighters. The fighting game aspect is really like a poorly made fighting game, though. It features gameplay from both adventure games and fighting games, but excels at neither. Tales of Legendia has this same problem.",-0.04642857142857143
1627,2.0,"SimCity had SO much great potential to be everything we all wanted and more. Unfortunately, EA had to decide to give us players absolutely nothing that we wanted and make us ""rent"" their game at the cost of sixty dollars minimum in order to actually use it, rather than own it.

THE PROS:

* Really nice graphics.

* Building add-ons and upgrades.

* The simulation aspects of the city itself are very good.

* The gameplay is easier and more user-friendly.

* The ability to individually follow a Sim or a vehicle, though you won't be able to label them or ""create Sims"" to keep track of.

* Great Works, massive city-sized projects, being a new introduction into the series, gives you something major to work towards.

THE CONS:

* Always have to play online. Perhaps the BIGGEST flaw of all. You CANNOT PLAY WITHOUT A REALLY HIGH-SPEED INTERNET CONNECTION. It is REQUIRED! If you have a slow internet connection, you're screwed. If you don't have home internet access, you're screwed. You have to log into Origin, and then play the game off of EA's servers. As you may or may not be well aware of now, the EA servers are atrociously bad. And what will happen ten years from now if anyone wanted to play this game? I still play Sim City 4 and that was released ten years ago.

* Server issues, of course. They suck and their terrible-ness isn't going away anytime soon. This is a separate issue by EA, unrelated to the Always Online issue. During the first two weeks, most players couldn't even get INTO the servers. These problems will likely be fixed over time, but the Always Online requirement likely won't ever away.

* Can't save your own city (its auto-save) and can't reload anything. You cannot test or experiment anything in your city to see how it works, because of this. Also, because of the server issues, you very well could lose everything due to the auto save feature. Or, if you can't get back onto your local server and have to use another one.

* Limited city size. Most people's OTHER glaring, giant flaw in the overall game. This really should be called ""SimTown (2013)"". The size is only about a 2 square kilometer area. Or 400 square city blocks, at its maximum peak. This is much smaller than it sounds, and a full entire city can be made in about an hour. You'll get about another hour or two out of it upgrading and trying to maximize everything to peak efficiency, so... up to three hours, on average, is what you're looking at for a fully complete city, here.

* You cannot, for the most part, build a fully functioning city, by yourself. While with some, it is possible, the game is really set up so that you more-or-less have to trade resources with other cities in order to properly function. This was their vision when they made the game. They wanted it to be an interactive social experience. Otherwise, the multiplayer would merely optional for those who want it, not so heavily encouraged to the point where they try to force you to use it in order to get a fully functional city. As for trading resources... you can either do this with other players online if your region is publicly open, or if you're like me, you'll prefer a private region that only you control. However, if you do a private one, you'll constantly be hopping between cities once you hit a peak or barrier for resources. If you do an open region, you'll have to rely on strangers to help you build your city and assuming the server DOESN'T shut down on them, they lose their cities, they don't troll, or they don't just forever abandon their city that your town is forced to rely on, they still more than likely will mess you up more than help you. Problems in other cities affect yours, and how many people would really care or be considerate enough to not cause problems to your own city, especially in cases where it won't affect theirs?

To put it in other words, Forced Multiplayer and cooperation kills any single-player fun to be had. Unless you play with personal friends and they all think like you do and you can all work towards a common goal, this will surely be more of a hindrance than if you could just play fully alone. This is beyond forced and unnecessary. You can build a great city entirely on your own, but you have to be an true expert player in order to do so. Its very hard.

* Speaking of which... Specialized cities are more-or-less mandatory instead of merely optional. Because every city on the region needs to support each other, SOMEone's going to have to build an industrial city. And someone's going to have to be a mining city, garbage city, cheap commercial city, etc. Sucks all the fun and imagination out of it all, just like modern-day Lego kits.

* Also... the interface is pretty much the same way. Much more user-friendly and simple, but offers FAR less creativity, as well. Every single possible thing in the city has to be linked by roads. Can't build a park or anything out in the middle of nowhere. Can't build a cabin up in the woods. Can't build a mountain retreat to have an isolated Mayor's Mansion at. And so on. Also, the zoning for neighborhoods also offers less freedom. You have to zone by road size, now. The ONLY upside to this is that roads also now take care of any power and water requirements, so having to build power lines and pipes are no longer necessary. Though some people won't like this newly added shortcut (I am one of them) because pipelines weren't that big of a major hindrance in past games, to begin with. The road system causes more problems than solutions, especially in a designated space smaller than most major city's downtown districts.

* No terraforming or creating your own custom regions. It is absolutely impossible to affect the natural resources of the land, like creating rivers, digging lakes, or forming mountains. Oh, and the pre-made choices aren't really that great, either. This also leads to monotomy and the same boring terrains every time.

* No option to skip tutorials. They are long, boring, lame, and there every time you start a new region/city. Apparently, you can exit out of the city to avoid having to fully go through them, though.

* Many things missing from previous SimCity installments, like subways or well, ANYthing underground. These will likely be sold as exorbitantly high DLC's.

* The Sims are glitched/flawed. The way the Sim Agents work is: A sim will go from a house and work a job. Then, go home at the end of the day. Only problem is, no sim ""owns"" their own home, and they just go to empty houses/jobs by proximity and occupancy, so they really don't ""own"" individual jobs, either. This will result in whatever businesses that are furthest away from your residental Sims to fail, because the Sims will never travel that far until all the other occupancies/jobs are filled up, first. So, you could have several over-crowded businesses near your residental homes, and several abandonded/empty jobs further away from your houses that they fail to reach because they're 'too far away.' This is also why traffic jams occur frequently despite how man bus stops you put down and why businesses seemingly fail for 'no reason.' In order for it to work functionally, you'll have to plan to put your top businesses or factories near the entrance of the city and your residental areas somewhere in the middle of town, or close to one designated spot where jobs are. Spread anything out or place jobs in different parts of the city besides one spot, and chaos will ensue.

Overall, this SimCity game could've been SO close to perfect had EA not deliberately chose to ruin it with their horrible and likely greed-inspired choices. Merely not forcing players to have to always be online with a high-speed internet connection, not forcing them to have to rely on their laggy and buggy servers, not forcing multiplayer on one of the only truly Single-Player Gaming franchises out there, and NOT giving us such small city-size limitations could've and probably would've made this game a perfect SimCity/city managing simulator (even with minor bugs, aside).

But as it is in reality right now, it is a forced Massive Multiplayer Online experience (not even true multiplayer, but rather a 'multiple single-player community') that has you building tiny two-by-two square kilometer towns where resources are always limited and there's always a very good chance you'll lose your entire city and everything in it.

Again, allowing us the FREEDOM to play this game by ourselves, offline, with actual city-building space would've likely made this game near perfection. But as it stands now (especially at sixty dollars), it is not worth your time, money, or attention.

Remember Mass Effect 3's ending (if you've ever played that before)? What is it with EA and upsetting their fans every March? It doesn't take a genius to figure out all they need to do. Its mind-numbingly simple; so dumb, anyone can figure it out. Give the fans what they want and they'll give you their money! Win/Win. THQ - an extremely horrible gaming company that cut corners and ripped customers off in the most extreme ways - learned this lesson the hard way. They are now bankrupt and deservedly so. EA has screwed up time and time again in the past, and their customs of restricting players' freedom and greedily high-pricing them and ripping them off with DLC/expansion packs will not go unpunished. Fans can be very vocal about this and I know most companies likely won't care about fan complaints, especially over the internet. However, when customers speak with their wallets, shareholders and investors also become very unhappy and companies fail and die off. You simply CANNOT be successful while cutting corners, taking away freedoms, and upsetting all your loyal customers. Game companies aren't like McDonalds or Comcast cable.

Again: It's simple! Give us what we want and we'll give you all our money! Up until their ending, Mass Effect, developed by BioWare and published by EA, got this 100% right. But then, they didn't and boy, did that hurt them. But it seems EA refuses to learn from their mistakes. Funny thing is, EA's quality isn't even as bad as THQ's was. THQ made terrible games, and made terrible game decisions on purpose, AND ripped off their customers with pure greed as their intentions. EA at least, has quality games, yet they still manage to p! ss off their fanbase just as badly.

As we stand, we have a SimCity game that was developed wonderfully by Maxis and ruined, at least in part, by EA and their ""Always Online"", ""Always co-dependent on other players"" bone-headed executive mistakes to maximize profits and minimize quality or player freedom. By the way, the game could've been fully functional offline, and one of the main reasons they did this is to prevent ""piracy,"" which is ALWAYS a greed-based decision. (5% of players pirate the game, so 95% have to suffer for it?)

SimCity is a game that could've been, but never was. And its painful to see what a fun game this could've been, but ended up turning into, due to technical crap. Because of the possibilities for a great game, I can't in all honesty, give this 1 out of 5 Stars. And the game WOULD'VE been awesome, had it not been so restrictive and buggy. But it is, and they ruin any possibilities for the true great gaming experience this could've been. While there may always be hope for the future, such as a console-ported version that addresses and fixes all of the current mistakes of this release, as it stands now, SimCity 2013 is not worth your time, not worth your hard-earned money, and not worth your attention, at all. It pains me to have to say this, but when companies mess up this big and royally, they have to be held accountable. Someone deserves to get fired immediately over this. SimCity is THAT bad.

1628,2.0,"The only pro to this game right now is that it runs more smoothly than Sims 3 on my computer. I've been playing Sims since 2001 and this is the first time I've been legitimately annoyed while playing. The ""emotions"" change way too often to where I feel like my sim is a moody teenager. I had to use a couple  rosebud cheat codes because buying the cheat items means all you are doing is keeping their needs met, not building any skills or socializing - or earning enough money to get better stuff. I expect that the first hour or two, but not after playing a few days. The new home building feature is okay, but I built some walls without using it and the game didn't want to recognize the rooms as being indoors, despite having a roof. I also can't figure out how to create floors on the second level where the game hasn't already put them. It's not as intuitive as one would think. My sim has held countless parties and gone to many places around town and has only been able to make one friend, so far. So I'm stuck in level two of my career because despite having the highest work performance for a (sim) month, they can't advance until they have four friends.
This game has none of the innovation that Sims 3 brought. I feel like I'm playing basic Sims 1 but with better graphics and whiny sims. I don't know what they were thinking. It's like they got tired of people being creative and having fun and wanted to go back to making us watch someone pee, shower, eat, and sleep every 15 minutes.",0.02812049062049062

1633,2.0,"I have to admit I was really excited when I ordered this wireless controller, I have a bunch of games in both my iPhone and iPad and really thought this would be useful, especially for platforming games like He-Man and the like.

The controller looks great out of the box, feels comfortable and small enough to be considered portable, it is not bulky at all. It comes with a small pouch so you can keep it there and bring it around.

So how did the SteelSeries controller perform? It was excellent! Out of the box all I did was plug it into my PC to charge the battery, then turned it on (A+B for iOS devices) and linked it to my phone via Bluetooth connection. The whole process was quite easy and the controller worked seamlessly with 'Temple Run'. Unfortunately, that is the only game from my library that is compatible with the device.

See, if you are planning on getting this controller for your mobile devices, make sure to check the list of supported games that is published in the manufacturer's website first (I'd post the links here but Amazon  normally removes those) While there appears to be plenty of supported games, most of them are not games I like or own; even more ""commercial"" games like 'Angry birds' and similar are not compatible.

The controller can also be used on PCs, I honestly can't comment on this as I already own a Logitech remote (which I rarely use when playing games in the computer); for my original purpose, which was to use this with mobile devices, this controller will just not work.

Add to that the elevated price tag and I could not really recommend this, it is a shame because the controller looks so well made and performs great, and it will end up stored in a drawer.

1634,2.0,"For $59 I'd give it two stars.  Coming from the battlefield franchise its fair.  No in game voice chat, hard to play as a team.  Weak starting guns, really a grind to get to level 13 or so when you can get some good unlocks to play better. Some games like drop zone have horrible spawn points where you spend 80% of the game running into the action.  If you have a good partner you can spawn on them but if not their dead 90% of the time or they are too clueless. Only 4 maps that keep rotating around, hope it doesn't get too boring. The download PC version crashes when I try to exit the game. Would be nice to unlock a spawn item so you can come back into the action without having to run for 5 min. Some maps have lots of tunnels and you think your close to the action but you have to run all the way around to get there.

However, if you're looking for a nice relaxing time with lots of fishing, this isn't it. If you want lots of walking, bike riding, pop-up text talking, side quest, and missions, this is for you. The game had so much going on that it just became a nuisance. The camera angles are terrible, as you walk around it doesn't stay behind your character, but beside him/her. Often times you have no clue where you're going or where you're at. The graphics leaves a lot to be desired even for a WII title.

1645,2.0,"I have played every game in the Contra series except Contra 4 for the DS.  This is the second worst game, just slightly better than C the Contra Adventure.  The game is beyond tough, but certainly not in a good way that keeps you coming back for more.  It is the type of difficulty that will just make you want to turn the system off and leave the room, slamming the door behind you.

I love a challenge.  I grew up playing some of the toughest games on the NES and the Genesis.  In Legacy of War for the PlayStation, I can only make it through the very first part of the third level on EASY difficulty.

I recommend playing on EASY difficulty using the CD 228 robot character because he has the best weapon loadout.  I don't recommend the other difficulties since you will lose your weapon after one hit on a higher difficulty.  Once you pick up the homing rockets, just run like hell around the enemies holding the fire button.  I am convinced this is the only way to progress in the game.

The levels have no checkpoints.  If at any point you die, you'll be starting from the very beginning.  This makes it so hard to progress.  If you make it to the end level boss, you will likely only have a couple hit points left.  I assure you that isn't enough for the drag out brawl that is about to ensue.

One of the worst things about the game is that you lose all your weapons you have collected at the start of a new level regardless of what difficulty you have set.  That's a total slap in the face to the player.  Really, shame on them for doing that.

The second level is kinda neat because there are two arcade machines which you can actually play.  One is Pactank, and the other game is Gyruss.  I spent WAY more time playing Gyruss in level two than I did playing the actual Contra game itself.

Level three is where I just declared enough is enough.  You're floating on a raft on a river.  Your movement is just so restricted due to being on that small raft.  I am convinced it is impossible to clear level three.  You must be some sort of savant to beat this game.

1654,2.0,"The game is decently fun and brings back some memories of the first two, which I played over and over for hours upon end.  The game play lacks the challenge and death penalties of the previous ones, but every game seems to be going that way, so I can't fault Blizzard too much on that as not every gamer is a hardcore gamer these days.  I have no complaints even about the DRM scheme as I'd much rather just be online (like I am 100% of the time anyway) then have some random DRM software installed on my machine.  I'll even let it slide that the physical DVD only contained a tiny .exe that just launches the downloader instead of having any content on it, as I got a cool stationary pad in the box ;)

The bad part though, is I have no clue how long I've spent actually installing this game.  Then after today, patching was a nightmare of the same problem.  Whatever torrent scheme they have running just seems to constantly fail at what it is doing or something.  It took hours to get to a point where I could actually download the files to play the game.

This was only accomplished by:
1) Downloading the blizzard agent/launcher from a 3rd party site and installing them manually by running it on a newly created windows user account on my computer that did not run as administrator
3) Switch that account to an administrator
4) Run the actual installer that was finally downloaded
5) Once downloaded, kill the installer/launcher/agent manually from task manager
6) Switch back to my normal user account and finally play it

It even sounds confusing to me when I go back and re-read it.  A normal (not tech savy) user would never be able to do this with instructions, much less figure it out on their own.

Is the game fun?  Sure, I like it.  Would I have bought it if I had any inkling of what it would take to get it installed/running/patched?  I can't say NO enough.  It just isn't worth it to play ""how to get it working this time"" every time a patch comes out.  I'm sure I am in the minority with this problem, but it shouldn't be a problem.

Tourism is broken.  All the casinos and attractions suddenly lost all the customers for no explainable reasons. I have airport, rail, and ferry running, but all of a sudden people just decide not to visit.

Interactive between cities has lots of issues. Simcity try to be MMO, but they cannot do simple transactions right. Imagine that each city is a character in a MMO, and it takes 10+ minutes for each characters to exchange items/gold?  Do you want to play MMO like that?

Public transports just randomly pick and drop sims, and path finding has lots of issues. Some of the stores say no shoppers and some sims ask where is shopping, even they are right across the street. A $20 game like Cities in Motion does a lot better than Simcity in terms of path finding and transport system.

1663,2.0,"*Disclaimer: Even though this game was released in 2009, I am reviewing this game according to my present standards, for the benefit of someone who hasn't played this game before and is looking to play older titles.

CONCEPT:
Cole was just a courier in Empire City until he became an unwilling scapegoat when a package he was delivering turned out to be a bomb, a bomb unlike any other seen before. Aside from causing mass casualties and destruction, Cole was imbued with strange powers--specifically, to be able to absorb and control electric energy and use it at his disposal. The bomb has also created a sickness that prompts the government to quarantine Empire City indefinitely. With riots and lawlessness in the streets, Cole decides to use his new powers to clean up the streets and find out who was behind his framing him for a terrorist. How me plans on achieving those goals is up to the player.

GRAPHICS/SOUND:
The graphics are on par with what was being released during that year, if not maybe a little rough here and there. Empire City looks  the absolute same regardless of what part of the map you are in; generic skyline, building structure, etc. Using Cole's super powers is pretty cool to look at, but that's really it, as far as what stands out. The music and overall sound of the game is pretty solid, although the dialog is very cliche and hokey throughout. I find this terribly annoying in some games, and InFamous is no exception: putting effort into making the main character look good (graphics-wise), then obviously half-assing it for every other NPC in the game, whether or not they are part of the plot. I can understand when it's done for NPC's that are there to simply populate the game, but the actual characters that Cole interacts with on a regular basis look horrible, sound lame, and their movements are clunky and robotic. If I were to guess, I'd say that whatever code was used for their movements was taken straight out of the first Resident Evil.

GAMEPLAY:
For me, this is where the game really suffers, and I apologize in advance if I start going off on a tangent. Character movement of Cole is very rigid and non-organic, and the horrible camera function just exacerbates the issue; often swooping around during mid-jump and throwing off your perspective. Scaling buildings is extremely frustrating and not nearly as fluid and ""organic"" as the makers claim it is. Oftentimes when I would try to climb something like an electric post or jump onto a ladder against a wall, the character would constantly jump right past it  over and over again until I had to position the character RIGHT IN FRONT of what I was trying to climb and finally he would interact with it appropriately. Cole needlessly climbs things that you didn't need him to climb, which causes a lot of headache when you're being shot at by a mounted machine gun and instead of hopping down to get behind cover, your character wants to skip from mailbox to mailbox, right in the firing line. Oh and that reminds me: if there is one thing that Cole is good at, it's dying. Even when leveled up completely, Cole loses health and dies with some serious regularity when being shot at, which is odd for a character that can jump off a 30 story building without a scratch. Oh yes, and despite him essentially being a living electric conduit with voltage running through his entire body, being too close to one of your own ELECTRIC ""grenades"" results in death. Death always results in you being transported back to a single re-spawn point in the map until you unlock more medical centers, where you will just spawn to the one closest to where you died.

Other than the above mentioned shortcomings, the gameplay is pretty basic: open-world map where you can choose various missions to take part in and complete. As you finish some missions, you will be rewarded with new power-ups for your special skills. Other missions you complete with make the zone the job was in ""safe"" and no more enemies will pop up there. Mission types break down into 3 categories: Good, Neutral, and Bad--pretty self explanatory. A lot of like Fable before it and many other titles since, InFAMOUS allows you to choose missions and/or make decisions that determine your moral compass, and how other characters perceive you. Some power-ups are only available for a really ""Good"" character, and likewise for anyone who dedicates themselves to being a right prick to pretty much everyone. Aside from balancing out your goodness/evilness, the missions are a bit repetitive at times.

REPLAY VALUE:
If you're like me, I always like to play as the good guy on the first run, then be an outright tyrant the second time around. Unfortunately, the hang-ups on gameplay are something that can be quite tiring, so I would give this a moderate/low replay value.

OVERALL:
Video games have improved so drastically over the last few years that some just get left in the dust compared to others. InFAMOUS is a title that gathered enough momentum to warrant two more games under it's umbrella, so obviously it's not the total failure I may have made it out to be. Like my disclaimer states, I critiqued this game based on my present standards because very few video games could be considered ""timeless"", and InFAMOUS to me, isn't one of them. It's not a great game, but it's not unplayable either. If you want to play the sequel and Second Son (which looks amazing), then it stands to reason that the plots would make more sense and the feel would be more genuine if you start from game one. Another thing worth noting is that I experienced absolutely ZERO glitches, which is a bragging right that a lot of the bigger and more successful game companies have NEVER had.",-0.015031093892604465

1666,2.0,"I got this despite the bad reviews because I thought, if anything, it would be a great game to kill some time when I get bored. Sadly, it can't even keep my attention long enough for that. I have played this a few times and each time I have to force myself to actually play the game. You can't do much besides price a few items in your shop. The items are large and look unnatural, on top of that the customers buy things literally at random with no reasoning behind it. I found the map that is in the game to explore to be very limiting and uninteresting. There are very few places to go and the places that the game does have are very poorly thought out. For example, you can go into a house and visit various rooms in the house....but there isn't much point in it because there is nothing in the rooms to interact with. The characters you do encounter say weird and random things that don't make much sense. I had a customer shout, ""I'm here!"" when I clicked them to interact. It's a sad attempt at what could have been a great game. The concept was cool, but I wonder how many days or weeks it took them to throw this title together. It sure doesn't feel like a game that was developed for very long...or tested for that matter. I recommend you save your money and don't get this one. I have games on my tablet that have more content in them than this one does.",0.0033046814296814313
1667,2.0,"I have finally given up on Cursed Mountain.  Not because it is too hard, because it isn't.  Not because it has a terrible story, because the story isn't bad.  It's the controls, and boy did the controls break this game.  I don't know how far I am into the game, but it doesn't feel very far and I just have to give up.

PROS:
+++ Atmospheric graphics and sound
+++ Some genuinely creepy stuff
+++ Really cool concept

CONS:
--- Sluggish, unresponsive controls
--- Tedious level designs made worse by the slow and sluggish controls.
--- Very low resolution graphics.  Looks good on a low-end TV but on my hi-def TV the textures are blurry and blocky.

GAMEPLAY: You play a mountain climber that must find his brother that disappeared on a mountain deep in Asia.  Essentially, this is a survival horror title, and it has much in common, good and bad, with other games in the genre.  Go around, smash pots, find glowing items to pick up, kill ghosts with you magical ice axe, use your third eye to see ghosts and blast them with your ice axe, and use wii-waggle gestures to break seals/spells.  Somehow this should all work, but the gameplay does not feel polished enough.  The game started to feel tedious very quickly, but I think the biggest issue is how the controls and gameplay intersect.  The lack of level maps or exploration maps also annoyed me.

GRAPHICS: Sometimes the graphics look great and other times you feel like you are stuck in a low-res pixelated mess.  The only saving grace to this game's graphics is the fact that the developer has some talented artists who can make low-res textures fit together nicely into an atmospheric ambiance.

AUDIO: Quite good.  The voice acting of the main character and the monks is forced and strained, but the ambient audio effects and music are actually done amazingly well.  Definitely the most polished aspect of the game.

CONTROLS: Sluggish and unresponsive.  The old Resident Evil games feel more responsive than this game.  I can walk faster than the main character can run, which makes no sense because the main character is professional mountain climber.  Mountain climbers are nimble and strong.  This guy feels like someone nailed his feet to the floor.  The climbing sequences feel bland.  The camera isn't bad but it isn't very good either.  Combat is fairly uninspired and the collision detection for attacks makes no sense.  Sometimes I manage to hit targets that I obviously missed while other times attacks seem to pass through without effect.  I might as well flip a coin.

VALUE: I couldn't stand to play any more after only a few hours, so I don't rate the value of this title very high.  I understand the game is fairly short based off of other reviews that I have read.

I was really looking forward to this game, but now that I've had a chance to play it I am pretty disappointed.  I feel like the game wasn't quite finished, rushed out the door before the proper level of polish could be applied.  I really hope to see this developer create another game, but I just hope they do a better job of it before putting the game out for sale.",-0.004066756716351044

1670,2.0,"I loved Halo. From the moment I picked it up it ""spoke"" to me like no other game ever has. And, I've been playing video games since pong. For 2+ years me and my friends would spend EVERY weekend playing online using XBC. Even with all that game play, it never got boring for us. Normaly, when I play a game and beat it, it then goes to the shelf to sit next to the rest of the games to collect dust. Even games that are fun to play online have never kept my attention for more than a couple of months.

So, when I tried out Halo 2, I was vastly dissapointed. I felt like I was playing another sega of the Unreal franchise. Master Chief has new low gravity jumps. Multiplayer now has gravity pads. You no longer take damage when falling from up high. Part of the strategy of Halo multiplayer was using objects to break your fall. The new weapons that I will talk about shortly make for a much faster game with a ""spray and pray"" feel to it. I thought I was buying Halo. Had I wanted Unreal, I would have just bought Unreal. Part of Halo's charm for me and many others was the fact that it wasn't Unreal or Quake. It was a skill based shooter that stood on it's own.

I had a few problems with the campaign mode. It was very dark compared to Halo. I don't mean sinister, just dark. Not very many bright sunny days in Halo 2. It was rather short. And they did things with the plot that I could have done without. But, even with this said it was alright.

The major problem for me is the multiplayer. The multiplayer is where replayability is a huge factor. When my friends and I played Halo for 2+ years, we didn't sit around playing the campaign over and over. The main problem are the new weapons. They have removed or changed EVERY single weapon in the game. The weapon that made Halo what it was, the pistol, is no longer. This wouldn't have been all that bad, but no good substitute is offered. They said that they did this for ""balance"". But, when everyone has a pistol, there isn't a balance or overpowered issue. After all, you need some weapons more powerfull, or you might as well just only have one weapon for the whole game. Now they have a sub machine gun as the mainstay. It's a very weak weapon with a very short range. So instead of playing and shooting and having fun, I now have to chase people down to get into range. That, or wait around for a couple of minutes for a decent weapon to spawn. The plasma rifle no longer ""freezes"" an enemy. The physics of the rocket have changed and the splash damage has been reduced. The grenades have been toned down to being almost worthless. Even the sniper rifle is a little different. There are a couple of new mid ranged weapons, but at mid range you'll be lucky kill your target in a full clip. The new weapons worked fine in multiplayer, but don't translate for multiplayer. By making such a severe change in the weapons, they also made a fundemental change in the game play. It is no longer a mid ranged shooter, it is now a short ranged shooter. This is another reason it gives Halo 2 that Unreal and Quake feel. Halo 2 offers duel wielding where you can use a single hand weapon in both hands. This was a novel idea, and tried with other games before. The problem I have with it is that most of the weapons seemed toned down to force you to use duel wielding. You can't swing a dead cat around without hitting some ammo for a duel wieldable weapon. But any medium range weapons you'll be scrambling to find ammo.

And there are a couple of new vehicles. They are fun, but my problems are in the changes to the vehicles we already had. Now you can board vehicles and they take damage. No more shooting a person out of a warthog as it drives by with your flag with your spawn weapon. Now you pretty much have to blow the whole thing up. GOOD LUCK! And well timed grenades no longer flip them over or stop them. Now you'll just do some damage to it instead as they drive by. And a persons shields are directly involved in when the vehicle is destroyed. You could shoot a rocket launcher at a Wraith tank and wait for the persons shield to recharge. Well, after 40 rocket launcher shots you would think it would be ready to explode, but no. Running someone over in a vehicle is much hard. I have hit people head on and simply bounce them off my vehicle about 100 feet without killing them. Boarding a vehicle is a novel idea, but a good player won't get into range of you.

I could go on, and on, and on. All I have to say to end this is, try it before you buy it. They had 1.5 million pre-order sales on the first day. Not because Halo 2 was good, but because Halo was good. Those 1.5 million people hadn't even tried the game. I too was one of the unlucky.

  The dungeons are intolerable there is basically no reason to go into them and theres no auto mapping feature  so you don't know what way youve been and then the skeleton regenerate  so you may fight the same skeletons over and over.
  Theres also lots of pointless jungle areas with nothing to explore. they just waste your time and make you run ( more like a geritall jog)through them.
  The game is way too short and the end is a major let down. I was actually stunned to find that i had gotten to the end of the game so quickly (15 hrs of game play). Perhaps if you do all of the side adventures it may bring you up to 20-25hrs max unless you are completely inept and die constantly without saving you games regularly.
  Also the character is very limited in movement. he walks jogs and swings a sword . He can not jump!!!!
  The good thing in the game is the sea battles they really did a fantastic job in this respect the whole thing is excellent in this respect with the minor exception of when you control your own guns and have the enemy in front of you on the larger ships you cant see the enemy because the sails screen them out .

1680,2.0,"I had missed the two expansion packs, so I decided to try it. I had played Medal of Honor before and had some fun with it. Airborne was better. I liked the idea of changing your landing point in the air. I have also preordered the new one coming out in OCT 2010. I was disappointed in the fact that the Airborne will not install. I did play the expansion pack a little. I was unable to do well in a few places and was forced to restart several times from a re-spawn position that started off bad in the first place. In comparison to the new games, you can't compare them. The storyline is good, the graphics are such that I cannot see the enemy target, however the enemy, being the computer, can see at a pixel level and therefore can see through the large leaves found in Pacific Assault on the islands. I found it frustrating that with one finger I could move the stupid leaf from my face and see the enemy in real life, but unable to in the game. Moving forward or backwards just replaces one leaf with another. Meanwhile my chest and torso are visible to the Japanese. I found the same thing in some of the Allied Assault scenarios. I had to use the cheats once to get through a battle just so I could see what was next. The AI was poor, the team I was with just ran around getting shot and I lost because one or more people on the team got killed. Of course they did, they just ran around and got shot. How do you prevent that? One member ran into a building and got shot. I went next time with him and prevented him from being killed, meanwhile another team mate got shot in another location at the same time. Game restart again. Geesh!

The low price would have been worth it had the Airborne one been able to install. I am going to go back and install it on an older machine, just so I can play it again. I only wish I could play it on my newer machine and see if the graphics are better.

I tried to follow the suggestions from the Internet, such as uninstalling a Nvidia driver, but it did not work.

I got too frustrated so I uninstalled it on my new computer. All that money spent on the new computer, the software and I cannot run a game that is not all that old.

I want to finish the storyline on the expansions, so I will install on the older computer. I do not remember the Airborne that much, so I will try that one too.

I used to really like EA as a company in the past. Now, I am not so sure that any of the newer game producers are deserving of my loyalty. I am going to wait for people to buy it, write reviews and then make my decision.

1689,2.0,"THE GOOD: New 3D engine from Lithtech (No One Lives Forever, Aliens vs Predator 2). Buildings and landscape looks good, and monsters look frightening. People and NPC's however, did not impress me much. Jagged edges on the humanoid models with mediocre texturing makes interactions feel like you're talking to a picture. Soundtrack is also pretty good, but a little repetitive.
THE BAD: Long load times, movement and turning is not smooth even with a good video card and may strain the eyes, low resolution. MM9 uses paper dolls to represent your characters, the same graphic no matter how you equip your character. One of the pleasures that I have in playing RPG's is seeing my character all deck'ed out in plate mail, or seeing my character with a huge flaming sword. MM9 only has a sketch of your character depending on your class and gender. You'll never see what your character looks like with a shield, dual swords, etc... Another not-so-good aspect of this game is the lack of monsters. Monsters do not seem to respawn, which means that your exp and money is limited. The interface tries to be like a first person shooter, and takes a bit of getting used to. Personally, I prefer the classic mouse click RPG interface. Also, no potion making.
BUGS: 3DO released patch 1.2 almost immediately after the public release of the game to fix a slew of bugs. There are still major quest bugs that have not been addressed, such as the Thjordgard Training Hall quest and the orb of linking quest. The game feels sloppy, and the broken quests may result in hours and hours of lost playtime.
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES OVER EARLIER MM: Trainers seem to be more abundant and accessible, so you don't have to travel the world to get trained in a particular skill. For example, both Sturmford and Drangheim have similar trainers. Quests seem to be easier (and very buggy). The world seems to get uglier and uglier - in MM6 and MM7, there were majestic castles, snowcapped villages, bright hot deserts. In MM8, there were lizard villages and dragon characters. Now, in MM9, there are half orcs, the game is often very dark and you seem to need a grandmaster mage to cast a decent light spell. I think the creators just don't want us to see (to cover up the ugliness?). Even at higher level, the light spell (torch) lasts longer and not much brighter.
OVERALL: I would say that this game may be worth checking out. I have to admit, despite its shortcomings, I am having a lot of fun. Definitely a buy if you are a die hard MM fan and this game happens to drop [in price].",0.010512582225872803
1690,2.0,"I originally picked up this game having watched G4tv's ""Video Vixens"" -- I must admit, their marketing-journalism got to me.  I wanted to try a game that was a bit sexy as well as funny.  I never played a golf game before, so I didn't know what to expect, but I thought, worth trying something new.

I found the game to be quite addictive but not for the reasons G4tv led me to believe.  OG2 is utterly maddening.  Since I'm not a golfer (or game golfer), it took me about a week to get comfortable with the game functions -- after that, I found myself playing close to PAR on the course.  I think that's a pretty good achievement.  Unlike the other reviewer here, I found the putting system to be do-able.  The difficulty with the game is that there is no margin for error, and thus, no margin for success.

I've played the same course, over and over, versus the computer's first opponent persona ""Killer Miller"" and he...always...beats me.  There is no way to change the AI skillset to at least allow you to edge out the AI.  As a result, the game leaves me very bitter.  Perhaps I am imagining it, but I swear that at times, I am _not_ making a hook as I tee off, but the ball hooks anyway -- often at times which pulls me back from the lead over the computer.  Things like that, and the inability to dumb down the computer a bit -- have made me abandon the game.  I turn off the sexy bits (which originally lured me to buy the game) because I want to get through the game as quickly as I can!!!

The game has other drawbacks -- the load times are stupid long.  It's unbelievable how much loading goes on in an average hour's worth of gameplay (one ""tour"" course).  The game has a funny, edgy sense of humor -- the soundtrack is fun -- but the lack of control over the computer skillset ultimately made me walk away from the game, throwing my PS2 Controller down (instead of my putter).

1693,2.0,"A grand cast of Marvel's finest come together against 'The Imperfects' - a group of people who's traumatic lives lead them to an alien scientist who made genetically-enhanced psychos out of them.

This could have been such a good game. The character list is fantastic, the Imperfects each have well constructed back-stories and are as varied as the Marvel heroes themselves, the graphics are eye-pleasing and the fighting arenas are grand and fully interactive. Each Marvel character is represented as you'd hope them to be (e.g. Spider-Man and Venom can swing on their webs and crawl around the walls, Storm can fly and fry things with lightning, Magneto is relatively weak but, using his magnetism, can hurl tanks around, etc.) and there's a nice array of evil minions to kick around 'til your heart's content.

Sadly - as seems to be an ever more common occurrence with games nowadays - all comes crashing down with the controls. Their layout isn't bad (which is a good thing as there is no option to change it) and even the fact that this is a fighting game, yet has only ONE attack button can be forgiven (various aerial attacks, power attacks and grabs help change things up a little). However, the controls can be very unresponsive (the block button for example picks and chooses when it wants to block, when it wants to dodge and when it wants to do neither) and there is no target lock, which is a particularly frustrating problem when your character decides they'd much rather punch a nearby barrel and blow themselves up than attack the enemy getting ready to shoot you. This problem is then exaggerated by the erratic camera.

There are also a number of little things that will niggle away at your enjoyment of the game, such as not being able to skip a character's speech after they defeat you, a camera shot of a bad-guy flying through the air from a well placed attack distracting you from the half-dozen of his friends that are beating you around the head or the many number of times you find yourself too close to a wall and can only see a black screen.

This game has so much potential and I'd like to see EA go back and take a little more time over it should a sequel ever be commissioned, but for now, this stands as yet another example of a great game spoiled by rubbish player-interaction (Ghost in the Shell, Ultimate Spider-Man, True Crime: NYC, et al).",-0.011396020732686432

Alot of people felt it was a nice tech demo for graphics, but otherwise it just a platformer game with a few simple objectives that went on way too long.  I agreed, but still enjoyed it, and was curious to get through to the end to find out where the story was going.

I was a mollified to see that in the interest of making a larger game, the graphics in 2 have been simplified to run more smoothly. AC2 is full of blurred edges and textures and a muddy color palette. The shadows are blocky, and don't move realistically (especially on faces in some closeups). Character models show some weird artifacts. Distances are flattened in a perpetual haze. One thing I really loved about AC1 was how you could stop and look at any street and appreciate all the fine detail. Not so here.  There ARE more people types in the street in AC2, but otherwise this is a graphical downgrade that seems to want to conjure up comparisons to an oil paint 'look'. AC1 may have had hiccups and slowdown, but it 'popped' and looked alot cleaner on my hi-def TV than this.

The gameplay... might be a matter of taste.  If you wanted more step & fetch, this game has it.  You'll do alot more running back and forth, getting letters, documents, delivering boxes, carrying bodies, beating up philandering boyfriends, following people, etc. Having to manually follow someone who you are having a conversation with was a little weird. There is also the addition of an ingame economy, so you can now rob dead people, pickpocket, buy paintings, change the color of your clothing, repair your armor and weapons, hire prostitutes to lure guards (fun!), throw money in the street to draw a crowd... Point to point races against local couriers will challenge your ability to find the quickest route across the rooftops and pray Ezio doesn't 'stick' to the wrong surface. Simple Puzzle segments scattered throughout the game world will illuminate more of the games backstory.  A notoriety 'system' will force you to remove wanted posters (never on the street, always on second story balconies, for some reason) and kill local police. Visit Leonardo Da Vinci who will create weaponry for you if you have the right design sketches and later unlock a nice flying mission...

The core experience of the game hasn't changed at all, though. The running over rooftops is still a breeze (unless you're on a clock), and the combat is workable and fun, though the context sensitive scheme will occasionally frustrate, BUT - just like AC1, you don't ever get to perform a stealth kill on any of the games main-story targets... you track them, listen to a speech, run them down, run them through in front of a huge crowd, and then run like hell as dozens of screaming guards chase after you. It's hardly stealthy and you've done this already.

The story? You're the lusty son of a proud nobleman, wronged by a conspiracy involving the Assassins and the Templars, and nothing is what it seems bla bla bla etc... I will give that Ezio is a little more likable than Alta'ir of the first game.. but it didn't make me care about him or his family, or what was going on, and Desmond simply switching teams to be exploited by Lucy and her friends instead of the evil Abstergo Company  didn't impress me much, either. I thought Desmond was a dullard in the first game, but the Holy Land story was more crackling than this.  AC2's story gets lost in the volume of chores you have to do very quickly.

1699,2.0,"As a series Devil May Cry started and peaked with the original Devil May Cry video game for the PS2. Devil May Cry 3 and DMC 3: Special Edition follow the same general formula as the original game. Plenty of combat laden areas and cool looking weapons, a hero and an antagonist seeking power. The storyline of the series has never been the main focus and that is apparent in this game. Characters are brought in almost at random and with cloudy reasoning for their motivations.

What has always set the DMC games apart from the rest is the action packed sequences and boss battles. While DMC 3 has plenty of both you'll end up lamenting purchasing the game due to it's definitively tired controls, abysmal voice acting, broken camera system and poor storyline.

In deciding to make DMC 3 a prequel to DMC, Capcom presents a much younger version of Dante. In an effort to project the younger version Capcom also made him somewhat immature. While you may argue that this decision is appropriate you'll quickly realize in playing the game that Dante resembles a hyperactive adolescent boy. The sequences in between combat are laughable as any time Dante opens his mouth it's an embarrassment to the talented folks at Capcom.

More than any other complaint - the terrible controls, broken camera system, dated formula - it is the voice acting that prevented me from liking the game. The script is cheesy at times and the voice actors are always unbelievable. Stay away.",-0.054517531592654746

Most know that Ubisoft really jumped the shark with this game.  Bugs, bugs galore.  Clipping, texture loading, buggy cutscenes.  Just about everything a defective game could have.

The storyline was a corny, cliche romance.  Blech.  Assassin's Creed has always made love stories background noise in previous games (Cristina to Ezio, for example), but they really messed up making it front and center.  The female was a strong, independent young woman, but in the most annoying, selfish, and self-serving way possible.  The romance felt forced, and don't even get me started on Arno.

Arno was the new Ezio, but the failed one.  They tried to make him cool af, but it felt forced and fell flat.

English accents?  This is Paris, France.  Give me corny French accents any day.  I got Arab, Italian, Welsh, Irish, London British, Mohawk, etc, but for some reason they forewent French (although Aveline de Grandpre even had a Nouvelles Orleans French lilt).  Disappointing.

What happened to how this connected to the overarching AC story line?

Gameplay?  They ""fixed"" what wasn't broken.  Combat is a little iffy.  Free-running, I'll admit, was improved.  It still feels dumbed down, but it always has for a parkour game.  The character upgrade system is a little too RPG for an AC game, especially tied in with the necessity to online game in order to upgrade your character all the way.

The three things I loved?  Side quests (I did them all, and they were amazing), music (AC always gets this right), and the world.  Let me just say, holy moley, that world was amazing.  I felt like I was in revolutionary 18th century France.  The neighborhoods, the colors, the NPCs.  I still start up the game, even with all my anger towards it, just to feel transported to a different time.  Absolutely beautiful and awe-inspiring.

1704,2.0,"Long-time Nancy Drew player here. After the awesome ""Shadow at the Water's Edge,"" which has been one of my favorite Nancy Drew games in recent times, ""The Captive Curse"" is a weak, mostly disappointing follow-up that feels more like a shell of a game that is essentially a re-hash of things we've all seen before.

The game takes place in a castle (Treasure in the Royal Tower, Blackmoor Manor, Castle Malloy?), which contains its own little town of people who are being terrorized by a monster. Nancy is called there to investigate for the castle owner, who you never meet and can only speak to by phone. You can talk to a few residents of the castle, including the burgermeister, an old storyteller, the clerk in the giftshop, and a prankster little boy who likes to play games with you. You can also call Ned, who Nancy spends the very first minutes of the game in a phone fight with, and Frank Hardy. You can't talk to any other town residents, as they are all at home with their doors locked tight. The game takes place over the course of one evening, so there is no daytime.

I have a bunch of problems with the game. The mystery isn't that interesting. There are no compelling clues to find, or interesting puzzles to solve. Sure, you still pick up the odd object here and there, and there are puzzles, but they feel shoehorned-in rather than essential to the plot. Thankfully there is no ""busy work,"" but you do have to play a horrible board game with the burgermeister in order to get money. The giftshop contains items you can buy as souviniers, but all you can do with them is look at them on a shelf in your room. The most annoying things to collect are multiple pages of a book that each have one or two letters written on them. They take up way too much space in the inventory, and could have easily been put together as one ""item.""

Another huge problem is the game area. The castle is huge, but there is barely anywhere to explore. There are twisty hallways and stairs that leave you lost, but you can really only explore a very finite number of places. You can also explore the woods (which are confusing and easy to get lost in) and an underground dungeon, but neither of these areas is particularly interesting, either. You never feel a sense of danger, despite the fact that you're on the trail of a monster. The music is not memorable, and neither are the characters. It's obvious who the villain is, since there's only one character with development enough to have a motive.

Overall, an extremely dull entry in the usually great series of games. Better than the ridiuclously boring ""Creature of Kapu Cave,"" but not by much. The summer Nancy Drew game always tends to be weaker, in my opinion, so here's looking forward to the fall game and hoping it's as good as last year's was.",-0.015498356983864228
1705,2.0,"In addition to all the other comments already posted, I'd like to add a few of my own:

1. Frame rate issues everywhere. The poor little Wii doesn't seem to be able to keep up with the game engine's insane level of detail, leading to really choppy scenes and movement. Thing is, the Wii SHOULD be able to handle this - I think it was just poorly ported.

2. Random weird sound effects. There are some rooms where you enter, and it sounds like you're under a herd of stampeding cattle for no reason. It's annoying and after a few minutes in the room, it just makes you want to return the game for a refund.

3. You don't feel particularly heroic. Going around levitating things for other wizards (who apparently can't master the most basic of spells, so they ask you to do it) feels contrived, pointless, and ultimately not why we play video games. There are several places in the game where I swear I'm not playing Harry Potter any more, but instead I'm playing Box Stacker(tm). (For those of you who don't read The Onion, go Google for it. You'll get what I'm saying then.)

4. People have mentioned the lurching pace of the videos; I describe it as if someone had rented the DVD version and accidentally sat on the fast-forward button. I mean, how hard would it have been to add some sort of crossfade between scenes? Come on.

5. The ""Occlumency"" portion of the game is just plain laughable. I literally laughed out loud at how ridiculously simple and boring it was.

To sum up, clearly this game was rushed to market. It's frustrating to play, the game itself is a series of boring chores, and the ""rewards"" are nothing but self-serving videos of the actors and EA staff telling you how great the game is. It's nice having a bunch of DVD extras, but not for the price they're asking, and not for the price of 20+ hours of my time. Seriously, even if you're a huge Harry Potter fan, this just isn't worth it.

The results of battle therefore have little to do with skill or tactics, and the analogy comes to mind of that of a brothel; the better customers get the better services.

The  graphics are amazing, although there is way too much green, and you spent  less time in original-looking levels than in the ""normal"" ones.  Nevertheless, from the beginning, they look quite surreal and amazingly  life-like. More than that - they are aesthetic. The main character is  pretty much non-existent, snce he has no lines, and his only role in the  game is to capture monsters. The battle engine offers far too few choices,  since upgrading your character's equipment is nonsense (he rarely enters  actual combat), and you can't equip your monsters.

1709,2.0,"Let me first state this. I hate MMOs. I hate grinding. But i like Endgame
PvP and hate PvE.

The PvE PQ system is amazing but the mobs are all basically tank n spank and the AI is retardedly low.

The T1 RvR scenarios are decent. They are fun but bore quickly. They are basically all ""Hold the node"" games like Wow's EoTS without the flag.

The T2 RvR Scenarios are TERRIBLE. The capture the flag and hold the mountain games are basically the worst WSG matches all balled up into these scenarios. Huge turtles with no strategy or point but exactly that.. TURTLING. Remember how much you hated WSG turtles? Well here you have it.

There is no instanced PvE before level 20 that i saw. it was all ""PQ"".  The loot system is very fair and alot of fun.

The RvR scenario queues for Destruction are ridiculous. No instaqueue like WoW but you can queue from anywhere as long as you are in the zone(which sucks you have to fly and pay for flight each time). Or you can have a guildie connect to you.  I did not play order but if you want fast RvR do not play destruction. 30 minute waits? This is like WoW at its worst. I don't want to play 30 minutes to play a BG.

The World RvR is fun but its luster wears off. It's just a huge campfest. One sides pushes to a base, then gets beat back by guards. Then the other side pushes back and gets beat back by guards. It's a pointless TM/SS all over again. There really is no motivation to take a keep and noone is really caring or doing it yet.

But in the end this game is still a huge grind like WoW.  Mythic did not get away from the grind.  You HAVE to grind PQs to level up. There is simply NOT enough quests to just level and stay at your level. And the RvR queues and leveling is just so slow. They really needed cross server battlegrounds.

My recommendation: ""WAIT"".  This game is not finished and is still a grind. Wait until it gets good to waste your time. You're going to spend a good week of /played (Chinese farmers are saying it takes 10 days to get to 40).

I got 6 free days and i've quit. Why? It's a grind. I want a game that i can be max level and play and have fun. Not kill 10 wolves for 160 hours of my life before the game even starts. I am a PvP guy and waiting 30 minutes for a queue doesn't even cut it.

Also the kicker. If you crash(happened 6 times to me yesterday over 8 hours and have a Quad 2.8 with 8800GTX SLI system) YOu get booted to the back of the queue. You want to know how long i had to wait after 4pm? THIRTY MINUTES to play on my server.

So my advice is... Pick Order, Pick a low pop server with high pop destruction, or wait till they fxi it with x-server battlegrounds.

As of now if you like MMOs you will like it i'm sure. But if WoW was your first MMO its basically just a slightly improved WoW (PVE wise) with more crappy maps and LESS grinding, but still ALOT of grinding.",-0.008587823219025492

Like everyone says the graphics are bad. Horrid even. Campaign is glitchy with poor hit detection, sway, and freezes/crashes. Plotline is decent, though I haven't finished it.

Multi is fun as ever, but if you played the beta, expect that level of quality. Everyone is saying its made for the next gen systems, and I hope so, cause if it doesn't impress I doubt anyone would buy anything else from this franchise, BF4 on ps3 is that bad.

Everyone saying it is a step backwards and worse than bf3 in every aspect is correct. It has the quality of some game ya found in the bargain bin. very very poor.

The controls have been changed to best utilize new next gen layouts, but I set my control scheme to veteran, and heli/jet sticks to legacy. It wasn't that bad to adjust, had the hang of it in a few rounds.

No doubt this was rushed to market, it has no business being on a retail shelf.

Now, the game does have a fun factor, I did enjoy playing online, but I am a fan of the series, and only rented the game. I am not going to buy it on ps3, and cant really recommend that anyone buy it.

They should have made bf4 next gen only, and released new maps for bf3 to satisfy current gen. It is apparent that little time went into the ps3 version.

Though a huge fan of the series, it pains me to say, don't buy bf4 on ps3, its garbage. I know next gen is just moments away, but if a company is going to release a product and charge top dollar for it, they better do it right. current gen bf3 is just wrong.

1714,2.0,"So, we were first told about Counter-Strike: Condition Zero back in 2000, when Counter-Strike was still a GOOD multiplayer gamer, not ridden with as many hackers, and definitely not flooded with annoying high-pitched kids telling eachother off through the voice chat feature.
As you would expect from my anger witnessed in the above paragraph, I stopped playing the game. I waited and waited to get CS:CZ, the messiah of the Counter-Strike title. So, it just so happens that the game gets pushed back a few months, and then to the next year, and then the year after that. After a while, I lost interest in the game and just assumed it would never come out; I was wrong.
So, out of no where, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero appears on the shelves of game stores everywhere -- and at a pretty unbelievable price! What's there to lose? I picked up a copy and ran home with it -- ditched my important work I had to finish at home and saved it for later, now it is Counter-Strike time! I load it up and what do I get? Well, first, for all you Linux users, it was VERY hard to get emulating correctly on WineX. If you are a Linux user and a member of the WineX community, look at the message boards because there are now posts on how to get the game running correctly. So, once I get my emulation problems out of the way, I was up and running with my game. Impressed? No, I wasn't even close to impressed. Graphics haven't improved even close to what I would have expected them to in this day and age. New content? A little: You get a few different weapons, some fixed bugs, a few new multiplayer maps, and a single player addition to the game. So, on with the single player:
It's awful. And unlike many games such as Unreal Tournament 2003, graphics were NOT saving this gameplay fault. It's not very easy to explain really, but all you do is play the role of a counter-terrorist leader trying to take down a terrorist organization from committing random acts of crime. No depth to this story here, this is no Max Payne. Overall, the single player is not a great addition to this dying mutliplayer title.
Could anything, oh ANYTHING save this game from getting one star? Something sure did save it! Multiplayer, something I haven't got into yet, is a bit out of the ordinary for Counter-Strike players. First, it DOES NOT use that AWFUL 'steam' program to connect to servers. Thank god. Second, it has implemented a nice little feature that STOPS HACKING ALMOST COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT!! Thank you for this, because the cheaters on Counter-Strike ruined the game for everyone, and this is the one feature of the game that I thought was worth the four-year wait. However, not much has changed at all as far as GAMEPLAY goes in the multiplayer version of this game; still your plain ol' terrorist vs. counter-terrorist game trying to defuse the bomb or rescure the hostages or whatever. And a note: if you hate Counter-Strike like I do for the same REASONS that I do (the ANNOYING, and IMMATURE players, especially all the little children with terrible net-ediquet), you will NOT be satisfied in this game. Why? Oh, simply because there's MORE of them in the Condition Zero game over the original game. Don't blow your money on this game as an excuse to leave the terrible playing environments found in the original, because this is no sollution in Condition Zero.
So, this game isn't technically advanced (in the areas of video OR audio), this game isn't offering a very stellar single player game, and the multiplayer game can be found with the FREE version of Counter-Strike minus a little of the non-friendly environments. What good is this game? Beats me.  Overall, this game would have earned maybe three stars or MAYBE even four stars had it come out on time. But honestly, we DID NOT wait four years to get a game of such low quality.
Don't waste your money on this game. There's better games to be bought for this price range. You can try Max Payne 2, a great single player game. Or you can try out the warcraft series, a game I LOVE in the multiplayer scene. For a little bit more money, Unreal Tournament 2004 is possibly one of the best multi AND single player games I have EVER played in my LIFE. These are better options that will keep you occupied when you're bored and feel the need to play a video game.

I like creating teams (even if they haven't upgraded the logos/jerseys for created teams since the start), I love fantasy drafting with those teams. I've lived with shoddy CBA simulations in previous versions, I've lived with weird AI, I've even lived with the phantom offensive foul bugs from last year. And I've loved every one... imperfect though they may be.

Until this year.

Sorry guys, I don't want to be mean, but this game is fundamentally broken and needs a patch ASAP. I went through my usual create-a-team, stick it in association mode, start a fantasy draft thing. I got the #1 pick overall. Since I prefer to draft near the end of the round for more of a challenge, I decided to start over (oh, btw, this year the draft is serpentine for the first time, a neat feature but I wish they'd give you an option). So I exit out of the draft.

The game freezes.

I mean really freeze too, like you can't turn it off with the controller anymore and have to physically press the power button on the console. I restart, try again... same thing, freeze. I try again, freeze. I then give up on the association mode and play a regular game. Plays fine, little wonky, then the game ends, back to the main menu. Freeze.

This is the buggiest game I've played for the 360 since Naruto, and unlike Naruto one cannot fix the bugs by buying a simple add-on patch.

I love the idea behind it, as other reviewers have said, I just feel that it was executed in a very poor way.  Graphically, if flops.  The controls are also very clunky and difficult, as is the aiming.  The fact that this game was designed for a computer as well as consoles really shows when you first start playing, mostly due to the fact that there is an option for how good you want the graphics to be.  However, even maxed out, they still look like good PS2 graphics at best, not the top notch stuff that we've seen on every other PS3 game worth it's salt.  The graphics looked so good in the pre-release trailers and I'm left wondering what happened between then and now.
As for the controls, when I was looking at the pre-release trailers, it looked like they were trying to take the excellent handling of Uncharted and put it in a Steampunk universe.  A little un creative, but I was not about to start complaining, since Uncharted was such a good game and I am a big fan of the Steampunk genre.  However, the controls are clunky and it takes a long time to figure out how to effectively move through the environment.  Once you get them down, it's not a problem, but just that it takes you so long to do it speaks volumes to me about how little thought went into them.
As for the voice acting, ever since I first played Metal Gear Solid, I have put a high emphasis on having characters that sound realistic.  This game falls flat on it's face in this category.  The dialogue, perhaps if read by competent voice actors would be passable, but since the current ones are no good, it comes across as something from the new Star Wars films, only with worse CGI.
The shooting moments are where the game really shines, however, and it's a shame that the rest of the game doesn't back them up better.  The enemies are some of the best looking that I've seen so far on the PS3, and they do actually try to fight you in an intelligent way, which is very nice.
Overall, I would not recommend this game, simply because it feels that so little effort went into it.  It may look cool on the back of the box, but once you start playing it, you will learn that it really doesn't live up to what it should have been.",-0.013193254851069081
1719,2.0,"well honestly it's been over 20 years since this game's been released. If you don't know it already, this is the last DD installment for the NES and by far the hardest and most annoying to play. Damn you LJN!

It's interesting to bring in the ability to play as different characters, but with such a low amount of life it's nigh impossible to beat this game. Buy it for your collection if you want to just say you have it.

1721,2.0,"I remember when I played the demo for this game. It was brilliant - you could stealth around, you had to be startegic and the atmosphere 10 times as tense as any other game ever. You had to loot a mansion and you could pick up some jewels for yourself as well. You had to AVOID making a comotion. The use of sound and light (or lack of them) was excellent as well. It was one of the best levels of any game I had ever played.
I got my hands on the full version and rushed through the first level, eagar to see what theivery lay ahead. When I started playing the second level I found myself making my way through a haunted mine where I had to avoid zombies, kill spiders and eventually free someone from a prison. The whole thieving aspect had been taken away, and not only had degenerated into a standard cliched fantasy hack n slash affair, it was a BAD hack n slash affair. The next 2 or 3 levels were the same. Yes, you had to be stealthy, but not in the same context. I never played on - I had no motivation to.
This could have been one of the best games ever, but in attempting to appeal to the mainstream (lets face it, the thievery aspect wouldn't have sold well on consoles) they messed it up, and they didn't even do the ""it's-been-done-before"" bit well. At least if it was done well it could have offered some short-term enjoyment (albeit forgetable) so that I wouldn't have completely wasted my money, but as it is it was a missed oportunity.

1725,2.0,"I'm writing this review simply to inform people that may not know that 2K games have abandoned their MLB 2K franchise as of January 2014. There will be no future MLB2K titles, no updates or fixes for existing titles, and the MLB 2K games have been pulled down for digital purchases forever. Their MLB2K Facebook and web presence is completely scrubbed as well. If you happen to have this game (or any other MLB2K PC title) installed and you want to ensure you can continue to play it, make sure you KEEP it installed as this franchise might become full blown vaporware very shortly (outside of console used versions, that is).

Of course, 2K really have no one to blame but themselves for this as the games they released year-after-year were subpar in both gameplay and graphics. Support was lacking and it was evident that the developers weren't even really trying. It was just an annual cash in to them. The date bug in 2K12 epitomizes the shoddy way with which 2K Games treated their Baseball license. Unfortunately we gamers are now paying the price as Sony has become the exclusive MLB game maker by default and those of us without Playstations are left in the cold for any baseball titles.",-0.013951277480689243
1726,2.0,"This is an adult's review.

I've never played a Sims Pets game (aside from the PC expansion pack which is nowhere near the same). So it's my own fault for shelling out the [..] for this one by just assuming it would be based on the same concept as past Sims console games (The Urbz, Bustin' Out, The Sims 2, etc...).

I can see how The Sims 2 Apartment Pets would be appealing to young gamers--you take care of your uncle's apartment, several random pets around the place, and the pet day spa downstairs. In the day spa you work everyday until all customers have been served. You take the time to diagnose their pet's problems, then care for them based on that. There are different controls and methods you use for each different problem. The overall concept was appealing, but for me it was just way too repetitive. After awhile I found myself rushing through it hoping that something new would arise--however, except for a few minor additions of spa tools over several days of work there really wasn't much of a direction change in the game at all.

As far as caring for the apartment you can change the type of furniture and decor (wallpaper, carpet) of the apartment, but you can't add or move items. I had a hard time figuring out what I needed to do to increase my game completion, since I hoped that would make the game more challenging. And in memory of traditional Sims games they make you care for your Sims needs and give you the option to interact with other Sims, but it seemed pretty pointless because the needs rarely run low anyway.

Honestly--after playing the game off and on for awhile I just really think it's geared for a much younger crowd. If I were 12 I think I would love this game, but at least I know now to stay away from this genre.

1728,2.0,"The ""upgrade"" I received likely has a minor defect, so my base opinion is probably biased downward.

The one I received, though brand new, starts out sounding as if the fans are really struggling to get up and running. Once they have ""stretched"" (as I have called it) the fans are not terribly noisy, but I am aware to some people any decibel rise is unacceptable.

In my opinion, the largest downfall is that the item appears to be making heat flow less productive. My theory is that the PS3s stock cooling is faster and more efficient than the additional hardware. If the fans are attached when I approach the system after shutdown I can feel (though have never officially measured) the increased heat at the rear of the PS3. I have considered the possibility this could simply result from the push of hot air out. However, not only is this emanating heat increased from instances where I have the fans off, but it significantly climbs the moment I proceed to remove the cooling expansion. This was glaringly noticeable when I needed to pull the exhaust for the purpose of disconnecting my LAN. My assumption is that the stock cooling is pushing harder than Nyko's intercooler can keep pace with. I feel it is essentially forcing a bottleneck thereby preventing the heat itself from be sent directly out of the console's shell.

Perhaps I just received a weak specimen, but I really feel this product is more of a threat to the rig than an asset. Once my Nyko fans have done their ""stretching"" it seems like the attachment is running at 100% of its capabilities. Aside from the noisy start I have no evidence to the contrary that my intercooler is performing at its intended standard.

As you can likely imagine, this fan expansion has been permanently purged from use on my PS3. It will never see use again in my home. In fact, if I could give it to any of you, I would gladly upon request. This is one of those products I just consider a loss and a learning experience. I hope some shopper(s) get more satisfaction and utility out of the device than my abode. As far as recommendations/reviews go; I can only wish I had acquired this purchase sooner. Maybe then my cautionary words might have actually served to have helped someone out in their decision of whether or not the device is beneficial. As it stands with the next gen console(s) released (and this system encroaching quickly on a decade since release) it would seem my insight is of the ""day late and a dollar short"" variety.",-0.0009212403177920415

I was going to title this review ""airheaded,"" because that's my one-word summation of the game.

But in a moment of absent-mindedness, when trying to get to THIS page, I accidentally typed ""airheaded"" into the Amazon search engine, rather than ""Crysis.""

The spooky thing is that, at least as of the date of this writing, when you type in ""airheaded"" into Amazon's search engine, ""Crysis Maximum Edition"" is the first search result returned!  Like Amazon was reading my mind.

Or, more realistically, I can't be the only guy thinking that this game is a little short on, uh, pabulum.  Not that a first person Armageddon-style shoot 'em up is supposedly to be heavily intellectual; it's just that we've seen this so many times before:  you go around shooting a whole bunch of monsters, gradually acquiring more and more powerful weapons until basically you're fighting Satan himself at the end.

Good stuff!  Classic.  But there's not a twist in sight here, it's just the same ol' same ol'.

And it seems like they could have even thought out the brainless butchery a little better:

1.  The first section has you tromping through the jungle wasting a bunch of Asians.  What innovation!

2.  The second second is, admittedly, trippy.  It involves floating through a Jefferson Airplane-style alien mothership.  Promising, but brief.

3.  Guess what happens in the final section?  You've seen it a million times before.  Only here your final adversary is so close and the camerawork is so shaky that you can hardly tell what's going on.

1733,2.0,"I bought these November 2011.  This headset is great sound-wise, but I have had too many problems thus far overall.

My first gripe is all the damn cords.  I have them hooked up for my Xbox, PS3 and computer.  Its a mess of cables that go here and there and there is no way to reduce the amount of cables.  Most of the tangle is related to the Tritton and there is no way around it.

My mic stopped working about 4 months after getting the headset so I had to contact Tritton.  The customer support experience was awful.  Their hours are like Mon - Tuesday, 4AM-1PM and they are closed for lunch from 4:05AM until 12:58PM.  You would have a better chance of getting through to the President of the United States.  The hold times are unreal. When I finally got throught, things were better.  Tritton sent me a mic to replace the broken one free of charge - so that's a plus.  However, the mic they sent was NOT a matching replacement.  The Tetris-looking part on the new mic didn't ""fit"" into my headset.  I had to get a sharp knife and cut off a piece of plastic in order for it to fit.

Around April 2012, the silver decoder box made a crackling sound, sizzled, hummed and then went out.  Ever since then I have not had a headset.  I'm more just flat out disappointed than anything.  These things cost me $170 bucks and I only got about 5 good months out of them.

First off, the handle is too tall, and doesn't pivot enough to pull off flight stunts or sharp turns, and also too much tension so it's hard to be precise. Yet the major flaw with this product is the fact that the thrust control is at the back of the unit, and feels awkward when in game, it should've been placed to the right if ur left handed, or vice versa. Finally, the button controls are located at the bottom panel of the unit; so when ur in game and u have to press both RSB & LSB to engage dogfight mode, or even to switch views (u have to let go of the primary flight controls to do so...), or use the arrow keys, it is difficult and may cost u your plane on more than a few dogfight occasions...

1739,2.0,"Rogue Leader was the first game I played for the Nintendo Gamecube. Sadly, it was a poor choice. I own the original Rogue Squadron and I really enjoy the game, so I figured this would be a great first rental. Right from the start though, I was disappointed.
The game starts with corny dancing Stormtroopers to some old time music holding up yellow squares to form the Lucas logo or something. Whaa? That kinda breaks the mood... but forgivable. Then I got to the menu screen... scenes from the movies played randomly in the background serving no apparent purpose, except maybe to give the developers less original work to do.
When I finally got in game, being new to the Gamecube, I hit the training mission. I figured I'd learn about all the cool abilities of the various crafts and how to best fight the Empire. Instead, I'm ""treated"" to a empty field with random training icons floating. Most are completely useless, such as ""press A to fire... Good Job!!"" A few are truly retarted... ""You found a Jabba's Palace... GOOD JOB!!"". If I had that computer tell me 'good job' just one more time... I would have thrown my controller down right then and there. So, annoyed, I quit and headed for the first mission...
Without any good explanation or reason, I'm suddenly fighting above the Death Star. Lasers are shooting everywhere, tie's are flying in every possible direction, and my wingmen are screaming at me for leadership. I liked it. I quickly pull up the targeting computer and take down a few ties. Then I order my wingmen to do the same, and set upon the mission's goals. It was a great mission, but random.
Next mission, I'm in an asteroid field. How on earth did I get here? No... never mind... it looks gorgeous, who cares. I'm blasting stuff, having a unconvinced but good time. Sadly, this doesn't last until mission 3. By mission 3 I'm bored, the gorgeous graphics die down to just standard locations, and the missions are very tedious. By the later levels, it was so easy to mess up a small detail and have to start over I said forget it, no more.
This game starts off with a major blast (if you avoid the training) and dies quickly from there. It doesn't get better, it just keeps going instead. If you can find it cheap, rent it for the first few levels alone. It'll be fun for a few days. That's only if you can find it cheap or borrow it from a friend.

1740,2.0,"I just have to say one thing first: There clearly are not enough buttons on the N64 controller to make a decent variety of moves. Instead, in this game, there are about nine moves, most of them useless because they do so little damage. This alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that I have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game. Even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly, because of the limited amount of moves. There are also a few too many items, and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win. Also, considering that the gameplay wasn't good enough, the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play, but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt. But I will say that the game has incredible graphics, each character and scene developed beautifully. I also like that in practice mode, you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion. You can make the characters go at normal speed, or one-fourth of it, making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense. The two challenge rounds are also a challenge, maybe too great a challenge, especially with characters like Yoshi, who don't get a jumping boost, but an egg to throw. The bottom line is, this game is simply a rental, because that is about the amount of time it will take you to get sick of this game.

1744,2.0,"The Deadliest Warrior games are a perfect example of what to expect from a company that started out as an independent studio. They have made a small list of games since 2000 but most of them have been properties belonging to other companies. The first Deadliest Warrior game, based on the Spike TV show that was cancelled after three seasons on January 2012, was probably made on a modest budget. The sequal had more environments, features, and modes, though it largly plays the same. Sure, the combat isn't the most balanced, the visuals are very basic for what to expect on Xbox Live Arcade, and the audio is often absent or sounds like a bunch of stock sound effects -- but you can still have some fun when playing with friends.

You should know that despite having a different title, ""Deadliest Warrior: Anceint Combat"" is actually just a collection of the first two seperate games, ""Deadliest Warrior: The Game"" and ""Deadliest Warrior: Legends."" This is what happens when you have a independent developer that deosn't seem to understand how to lable arcade collections. Many thought with the different name it would actually incorperate all the fighters into one game, but thats not the case. This disc version does have a few extras, like 6 full episodes of the Spike TV show (1 from season one, 3 from season two, and 2 from season three) on a seperate DVD. You also get two new items for the sequal, 30 additional weapons for the warriors (two for each class), and the new Graveyard stage. If you buy the game used, you may not get the 6 episodes, so be aware.

PROBLEM LOADING GAME:
First is the way this game plays off the disc, which I've noticed some people having problems. If you try to play the disc it simply says, ""No Game on Disc,"" and then tells you to go to the Store. It turns out you NEED to have online access in order to download the demos for both ""Deadliest Warrior: The Game"" and ""Deadliest Warrior: Legends."" Now, whenever you have the ""Deadliest Warrior: Ancient Combat"" disc in the Xbox 360, the listing for each game will change from Play Demo to Play Now. I know, other games don't work like this, but this is what you have to do to play the game. Also, when the disc is in the console, go to game details and ""install"" the game. This ONLY installs the DLC for both titles, not the games themselves, but you need to do this beforhand as well. [Note: You can alo play the games by finding their locations on the Marketplace and selecting Play Now, but its just easier having the demo downloaded]

DEADLIEST WARRIOR: THE GAME
The first game has often been compare to the niche fight game series know as Bushido Blade on the PS1 in 1997. This comparison is mostly due to the nature of the one-hit-kills that are possible if the player lands a fatal blow to the other fighter. You could also incapacitate  limbs if they took to much damage, leaving frantic battles were one player would need to defend himself with only one arm, or have limited mobility with one injured leg. Not many games have had this  feature, especially fighting games in the past.

You get the main game and the DLC Pack (normally 400 points), which adds three more warriors, the Rajput, the Zande, and the Shaolin Monk. This also includes the new Skirmish Mode, replays, titles, and new taunts. You'll see a lot of low-scoring reviews for the first game (like 6-out-of-10), and sadley it mostly deserves it. Even with the DLC there's only 11 fighters and 5 environments total, the combat can seem cheap and unbalanced, and the AI can be downright infurrating. If you have a few friends over, try this game for some laughs at a nija fighting a pirate, and where the computer-controlled AI isn't a factor.

DEADLIEST WARRIOR: LEGENDS
You get the main game and the Joan of Arc DLC (normally 240 points), which added the Joan of Arc character, and Mac (modeled after third-season host Richard ""Mac"" Machowicz), though he's not really a new fighter since he randomly is dressed as one of the existing warriors before each fight. New to the game overall is the Generals Campain for each warrior (including Joan of Arc with the DLC), which acts like a simplified version of Risk. Each land is divided into numerous areas with a hadful of Castles spread across. You earn more reinforcments, which you can divide amound you current properties. Your ""number"" of reinforcments battle the enemy's number of reinforcments, and you take the territory if you win. You only engage in an actual 1-on-1 warrior fights when you try to take the Castles -- take the home Castle to win. Its simple, but each character's is slightly different, which will give you at least a few hours of enjoyment.

The combat has been changed slightly for the sequal. The ""unblockable"" special move is now gone, but in its place is two new moves that still can't be blocked, the push, and the grapple. The push simply moves your opponent 2-3 paces away, given you some room if you're being rushed. The game now also has ""ring outs,"" so depending upon there location you can now push them out of bounds. The grapple works like a game of rock-paper-sissors. Once you grapple them, both players must choose between three button presses, one for the head, one for the arm, and one for the legs. If both players pick the same button/location, the it cancels out. But if the attacker picks a location, and the defender picks a different location, then the attacker wins an immobilizes that limb. Oh, but if the attacker picks head, and you pick arm -- then the attacker get an instant-kill. Any successful grapple attacks to the head result in instant death, which means you'll always want to defend your head, even though you'll alway risk loosing an arm or leg. Thankfully the right Anolog Stick is used to dodge, and is very useful in moving out of the way of a grapple, but this move is still rather irratating.

The life bar has been removed, but its still there in the background. This means a match can still end by someone kicking an opponet that has very little life left. The throwing weapons have been modified so that you can't get a headshot right at the moment players take control, which is a releaf. You can still get one-hit-kills, but the mechanics just behave slightly different now if you plan on aiming them.

FINAL VERDICT:
Despite all the bad reviews, the first game had some interesing gameplay elements that never really delivered a product that was accepted by most consumers. I never would have tried it if it hadn't been slashed down to 200 Microsoft points at one point. Its flawed, but still can be fun if you're playing with friends, since that levels the playing field of cheap tactics. The sequal has that feeling of ""two steps forward, one step back."" While it tries to improve apon the criticisims of the first, it still plays largly like the original but with only a few things changed or missing. The quality and polish may not be there, but cosidering you can get both games and all the DLC for around $10-12, along with 6 episodes of the TV show (at least if the extra disc is included) thats not too bad.

1745,2.0,"The first Mana game, Final Fantasy Adventure, was awesome. So was its remake called Sword of Mana. And Secret of Mana, for the SNES, was an amazing classic beloved by many after all these years. So what happened with Legend of Mana?

First off, this game doesnt have the free flowing world and fighting of the previous games. There is no linking areas to travel between. Each area/dungeon has its own little space and must be found by doing quests. After you have obtained the new area you can place it anywhere on the world map, for reasons not wholly known or cared for. Its a very strange concept at best.

And the battles. Oh, what a terrible system!

When you enter a battle, all of which are preset and cannot be avoided, your character moves in stutter steps. He/she moves somewhat like a fencer, a pace at a time. This makes for awkward movement. And if you want to dodge enemies you have to move up and down. Want to attack? You can only attack the left and right. This two-way dodge/attack system was totally uneccessary compared to Sword and Secret of Manas free moving combat.

And the difficulty of the game... or lack there of.

In battle you can hide in a corner and slowly replenish life. Have a teamate? Stand close to them and you will regain life about 3x faster then normal. And sometimes defeated enemies drop candy which replenish all or most of your life. Oh, and after every battle you regain ALL of your life.

There are more ways to heal your character in battle than to attack!

All in all this game is a garbled mess. Its a failed attempt of Square to make a 'unique' Mana game which strays from the original formula. I cannot believe this game came from the same company as Secret of Mana, the Chrono games, and the Final Fantasy games. Avoid at all costs.",-0.025078479667729164
1746,2.0,"These headsets are very nice. It has good sound and fits well on the head.

However, they break very easily. That is because the wires in the rotating cups tend to bend a lot when the cups rotate. I had about six months use before having problems in the right ear. I took very good care of these headsets, I would set them down carefully when not in use. Unfortunately, after nine months I lost all sound in the right ear cup. For the price, I had hoped I could get at least two years out of these, but not so.

I recommend wireless headsets. The wires in any wired headset tend to break, even the P11's, which I bought after the PX21's broke.

Anyway, if you buy these, do not expect them to last long. While they work they are great, but some buyer's have complained that they break after a few weeks. These headsets must be used with care.",0.024874563133672443
1747,2.0,"I got the ""free"" copy of GH: VH from the GH5 promo offer. The set-list itself is great, but a little short on VH songs. I'd rather have it all exclusively VH tunes (much like RB: The Beatles) instead of having other bands' music. I was let down that Foreigner's ""Double Vision"" was a remix version with their current singer instead of Lou Gramm (It even says ""1978"" onscreen). Is Mick Jones that hard up for people to accept his new singer? There's also a lot of other band's songs that I don't plan on replaying again. I guess GH is starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel on songs. Rumor is ""Wolfie"" had a hand in picking those bands. They should've at least had songs from artists that were more of an influence on the band like Metallica did with their GH game.

The VH cut-scenes are pretty lackluster compared to GH: Metallica & RB: The Beatles. Some real love went into those, mostly on The Beatles' game. It's almost as if this was a quick production on the band's or Activision's behalf. I winced seeing Wolfie playing as an avatar instead of Michael Anthony. It just didn't ""fit"" hearing the original music and background vocals and seeing Wolfie in his place. It's almost sacrilege. What am I saying? It is sacrilege!

I was also surprised that the gameplay wasn't as hard on medium as I thought it would be. (I remember ""Hot for Teacher"" being too hard playing on medium on GH:WT.) Another criticism is that it came in a crappy cardboard ""promotional copy"" sleeve that's sure to leave scratches on the disc, instead of a plastic clamshell. I tried to complain to Activision regarding the matter and they told me I would have to purchase a new copy. I know it was free, but it still a justifiable complaint. I have the same complaint about some DVD's that come in cardboard sleeves. There should be a ban on this practice!

I'd say the game will be worth buying for diehard VH fans. $49.99 is a bit steep for an abbreviated game compared to the regular GH versions that have 75+ songs included for the price. This one has around 46 songs. They should include a Frankenstrat face plate or something to justify that price.",-1.1366035802126892e-05
1748,2.0,"You know I wish I could give this game a better rating but holy cow is this a grinding and repetitive game. I'm always disappointed when I need to finish a story mode to unlock all the tracks and cars, I mean it's a racing game folks, a story mode? C'mon! Sometimes I just want to pick a game up and do a quick race with any car or track I want. The worst thing is this is an open-world game when it didn't need to be. When you unlock something such as a new paint job you need to drive to the graphics garage just to apply it, oh, you unlocked a new performance part, well you need to drive to a different garage across the map for that too. The map is fairly huge so getting to one place to another gets very boring very quickly.

The graphics are pretty good and the soundtrack is decent, but I wish this would have been more like Underground 1. It takes FOREVER to unlock everything and at that point you're so tired of the game you never want to see it again. It's always night during races and it always rains.

1750,2.0,"Don't get be wrong, I love the EA NHL Series and if you have never purchased any of the EA NHL versions, BUY THIS!!! The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are awesome, the checking and goalie moves are fun to watch. I gave it a 2 because I buy the latest version every 2 years hoping for more exciting features and this year, I felt I was let down. For me to spend full retail for this for just a couple new features, was tough to do in this economy.

The good: Be A Pro is really fun trying to stay in the NHL without getting pushed down to the minors, but other camera angles would help a lot! The Higher Resolution is a big plus! The players faces look a lot better! A couple new checks and goalie moves and fight sequences, but the game doesn't feel any different. Cycling is fun when you get the timing down, and players do support you more.

The Bad: The arena's all look the same as other versions, they didn't change anything there. The anouncers are the same, and it feels like the didn't give them too many new phrases to say. All my old moves since 1997 still work, I scored 16 goals in my first game with a standard textbook play (take the puck down the side to the corner, center it when a supporting player is in center just behind the goalie).

1751,2.0,"Half Life 2 may be okay for a game that's over a year old.  But the problem is that the general public has never played it.  It's aging FAST.  When (or if) it finally comes out, it will be rather dated and unimpressive.

The other problem is that the enthusiasm for this game peaked about eight months ago and has been in decline ever since.  Timing is very important in game releasing and I think HL2 missed the mark by a long shot

1754,2.0,"Don't buy this game if you expect a Civ-clone. It's different from that. Building a strong economy through trade and production, keeping cool with the natives and rival colonies, and keeping the king off your back define this game, not war and pillaging (a great and fun part of civ). In fact, you'll shoot yourself in the foot if you destroy rival native and colonies because they're potential trade partners.

Colonization demands trade and micromanaging your people, unlike Civ. You don't just build structures and watch the money roll in. You have to choose jobs for every single person and make the most of their skills, or lack thereof. Micromanagement means plan, plan, plan every aspect of your revolution so that your towns are pumping out goods for sale because that's how you make money. It takes a lot of work and soon feels more like work than fun because you have to remember who's doing what and how much they're making of what product. You can get wrapped up enough in this that the goal of revolution falls to the background.

Colonization needs work to make it great. It's fun and extremely interesting, but some glitches make it un-fun, such as invisible units (which I still can't figure out how to fix). I hope Firaxis can give this classic the respect it deserves in the future.",0.03771955877219035

I am on my fifth console in about a year and a half.  Customer service says they're sorry but keeps shipping refurbished consoles that break again after several months.  I have had two brand new consoles and two refurbished consoles.  All have broken.  I requested a refund and was told no. I asked if they could guarantee to ship a NEW unit, not a refurb.  No!  Instead, they offered expedited shipping of my return box and a free complimentary game. Game of my choice? No.  I could choose from two.  Two that you'd find in the clearance bin at Wal-Mart.

They think they can give people a free budget game, a month of XBOX live gold, and a used 360 console and everything is going to be all right.  I guess they'll keep shipping refurbs for three years until all the warranties expire and then they can wash their hands of it all and the consumer takes the loss.

This is a great ambidextrous mouse for left-handed use.

Unfortunately, the on-board profile doesn't save the button configuration, so it will boot as a
right-handed mouse, then switch to left handed when you log in and the driver loads.

Also, the mouse isn't grey at all.  When you get it it's more like a shiny black chrome color.

1757,2.0,"My father is a seaman. I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision.

The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end.

The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.

First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary ""Time Compression"" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.

Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.

Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.

Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.",0.004468494468494469
1758,2.0,"The campaign, I should open with that.  Games that are not explicitly online multiplayer (e.g. Battlefield series) should have a strong campaign that is more than a extended training system for multiplayer.  I often felt so frustrated when I couldn't get past a part (Driving the tank across the ice while being bombed) after several tries that I had to put the game down and play something else or just read a book.  While the story was much better than I had expected, it left a lot out and sometimes just made no sense (The lab... did the humans create the Locust?  I couldn't tell).

The game play was ok, there was enough variety in weapons to be fun without being confusing (Though I played most of the game with only the chainsaw gun and sniper rifle, occasionally a grenade but never a pistol unless I ran out of ammo for everything else) but the game just felt lacking.  I know, vague, but much of the game played the same way; get under cover, fire until everything is dead, find next cover, repeat.  The few times when you were given a chance to ride in/on something ended quickly and at times mind numbingly frustrating.  The ending was a little blah, circle the super-monster-bomb while it was bombarded by orbital satellites until it exploded, not that interesting considering you were riding that monster before it decided to mutate.

Multiplayer is just boring.  The game systems function great against the AI but when playing with other people it again was slow and often a situation of who had the biggest gun or brought a friend.  The game played like so many games before it, but couldn't pull it off as well.  I would rent this game, it is not worth owning.

The game is simply awful from a PS4 standpoint. If you have played some of the AAA titles (e.g. the Last of Us) you know what I am talking about. I am a spider0man fan, and let me say this is the by far the worst spider-man game I have ever played.. Spider-man shatter dimension at least was a decent ACT game. This one I don't even know how to categorize it. It's just one of those bad movie games that you follow the plot and sometimes awkward moments to wait for it to finish (and it does not even follow the plot of the 2014 movie in case you wonder.)

Pros and Cons

Cons:

only 4-5 hr story gameplay with only 15 missions.
Cheap Action, useless controls. You can survive just by hitting square button and for the rest of the time follow the instruction on screen.
Bad graphics.. definitely not PS4 level
Loooong loading time.

The sound quality is good and its nice that it works for all the consoles (except next gen). There was one problem though, and it's arguably the most important. It was very uncomfortable to wear. It's not adjustable, so the plastic part is really tight. This eventually loosens up but that wasn't my main complaint. The cushions are soft for sure, but they aren't think or firm enough to stop the speakers from pressing against the cartilage of my ear. It hurts really bad. I later realized that I could twist the speakers around, and turning them 180 degress mitiagated the problem but its still a minor problem and I can't wear the headset for too long. Usually like 2 hours max and it gets too bothersome. This headset would have been perfect if not for that one problem. I don't know if I'm the only one who experienced that problem since I didn't see it in any of the other reviews. But I think its important for others to know.

1769,2.0,"I was fairly excited to play Vegas 2 online. At first, the game was exciting, but after a while of play, the faults of the game were just too obvious. This is without a doubt one of the most frustrating games to play online. The blame lies in both the developers and the players. I'll explain the problems further below.

List of my likes and dislikes:

* Customization of your character is fun and exciting. No two players online will be the same. On top of that, you can make custom faces (i.e. your own face) to put in the game. I haven't tried this feature, but just the thought of being able to do so is thrilling. You can customize everything from clothing, armor, and camouflage. A big plus to the developers on this one.

* You unlock new weapons by going through the A.C.E.S. I forgot what it stands for, but I'll explain what it does. The ACES is divided into three categories: Marksman, Assault, and CQC. You add points to each categories based on how you score a kill. After so many points, you gain a level (up to 20 levels per category) within the category and you can either get a new weapon or more experiences toward your overall rank. I thought this was a pretty cool idea, but some of the weapons within each category make no sense. For example, in the Assault category, you mainly score points by using explosives, but yet the weapons within the category have nothing to do with explosives.

* Finding a match online is just flat out frustrating. The lag is nearly unbearable. It seems like the host needs a very good connection in order to host large amount of players. Indeed, the developers can't control this, but I'm guessing they could at least minimize the lag by sending smaller packets.

* You will get kicked and banned a lot in this game. I don't know why too. It just seems like every other game I go in results in me getting kicked or banned. I have a mic, and I usually don't talk.

* Small maps and same respawn points. I'm assuming the developers made the maps so that you play one round then load another map. The problem is most game hosts use unlimited respawns, which sometimes cause losing teams to be stuck at their own spawn point and unable to get out of it while the other team sits and wait for you to come out of your spawn point. You do get a 5 second shield, which makes you invincible for about 5 seconds when you first respawn. Problem is some people are clever enough to wait outside of the spawn point near a door such that your 5 second shield is gone. I would have loved the game if the developers made it smart enough to respawn at another location on the map once the other team overrun the current position.

* Some guns look unrealistic. For example the 92FS looks like it has a huge hole in the center. Other ones look funny enough to me. I thought I was using a supersoaker when I first saw the M468.

Overall, I liked the game. But the flaw of the respawn system and the constant kicking and banning and the unbearable lag makes the game not worthy enough for me to play online. Please don't purchase for the full price. Wait until it becomes 19.99 and get it then. The price and content just don't go together.

1774,2.0,"The Good: Easy enough for casual players, playing as different characters is fun, weapon upgrades make a difference

The Bad: Bland environments, stupid story, bad level layout, boring aliens, slow paced, character upgrades are all the same, doesn't look very good

Shadowgrounds was a pretty doesn't shooter a few years ago, but Survivor doesn't really do much new, and is pretty boring. As a top down shooter you play as a marine who is trying to escape a ruined base that is overrun by aliens. The weapons are pretty generic with shotguns, assault rifles, flamethrowers, grenades etc. You can pick up health packs, ammo, and OK you know this formula already.

Unlike other better shooters like Alien Shooter the game doesn't even offer intense moments. There are a few straggling aliens coming after you and maybe a few hard ones, and that's it. You can easily kill these guys and it doesn't feel very satisfying at all. You can shoot barrels, toss grenades, or just run around holding the fire button and you'll beat these guys. Ammo is plentiful so you never feel like you're ""surviving"" and it's pretty hard to die.

There is an upgrade system that you use by finding ""parts"" and when you level up you can use points for different upgrades like sonar, health boosts etc., and each character you play has the same upgrades? That's pretty lame. While each character has a different load out there's just nothing exciting about it at all. The game is fun however since it's good for more casual players who don't like the intensity of other top down shooters, but even the aliens are generic looking. Instead of creepy deformed things you just get typical bug like aliens.

The game doesn't look or sound too good either, and the music almost seems non existent while the game looks pretty bland. The level design is also pretty bad since I wandered around areas and didn't know where to go like shooting a glass panel to open a walkway. There is no hint, the panel doesn't even light up or flash. So this is bad level design, and the whole freaking game just feels boring!

1778,2.0,"I haven't played through every Final Fantasy game as of yet, so I really can't say which game is the best and worst in the series. However, out of all the FF titles I have played thus far, I can say that Final Fantasy III is probably my least favorite.

To begin with, Final Fantasy III takes a step back from its predecessor, the infamous Final Fantasy II (for NES), and seems more closely related to the original than anything else: you will encounter enemies with similar names; 4 light warriors are recruited to set out and save the world; crystals are again in danger and need saving; the main enemy is not the last boss of the game, as a stronger enemy force is manipulating the scenes; at some point in the game you acquire a submarine type vehicle and can explore beneath the water; various types of Job Classes are included. To some extent, this could easily be viewed as a sequel to the very first game. There are some new editions, as well: the character interaction and plot building is left intact that was introduced in FFII, Job Classes can be changed throughout the game as you gain more crystals, you receive more vehicle upgrades than either of the two previous games, the world map is much larger with more places to visit and explore than the previous games, and of course Summons is introduced.

While all of this seems to be a recipe for an epic game, the game suffers mostly in plot and in gameplay. The graphics for the DS were okay, but not great. In fact, I think I would have enjoyed the game more had they kept the original NES graphics, or upgraded them to SNES quality as they did for the Playstation remakes some years back. The 3D quality doesn't always work, and I think I would have preferred simpler 2D graphics and use the extra space and power on creating better cutscenes. I was also not impressed with constantly having to tap the expand the screen to search for hidden switches and treasure; it was fun at first, but quickly lost its charm.

***SPOILERS***Now, I played through the first Final Fantasy on the original NES several times, and I love that story regardless of its lack of plot. I usually do prefer a plot, of course, but I prefer a plot that goes somewhere and means something. In Final Fantasy III, I enjoyed the first half of the game much more than I did the second half. Once I got off the floating continent, the game felt like an endless series of fetch quests, and the plot just seemed to kind of stall while waiting for me to find the rest of the crystals. Sure, there were several fetch quests through the first half of the game, as well, but the plot kept moving with these quests at a decent pace. My two favorite areas were the Ancient Village and the Gulgan Cave, because you learned so much without the game giving too much away. But by the time I got toward the end of the game, I was ready for it to be over with. And besides, didn't anybody else feel the plot revelations by the end of the game was depressing? I mean, to go through all of that, only to find out that main enemy will always exist, and that in time the world will indeed be destroyed, as it's inevitable, it kind of made me wonder what was the point of me going through all of this.***END SPOILERS***

Gameplay was another issue. The game started off mildly easy, it threw its share of challenges at me, nothing too great or small. Then the second half of the game took place, and the challenge increased, and it was a learning adjustment for me, but I managed. Then comes the last dungeon (or should I say 2 dungeons), and to get through it and get everything you need will take a good 1 1/2 to 2 hours at the very least, probably longer. No save points either. And then you fight through a round of tough boss battles, only to go up against the final boss and get wiped out in a matter of a few turns, only to have lost the last 2+ hours of your time. I pride myself on my level grinding, and my characters were at levels 57+ by the end of the game, but apparently that wasn't high enough, as I did on the final boss and had to redo the last 2 or 3 hours of dungeon crawling. Frustrated, I turned on a cheat code that raised my characters to level 99, and although this was much more doable, it was still challenging. To not have any saves between the 2 dungeons, to require somebody to go through 2 hours of torture, and then wipe them out so they have to do it again is unforgivable. Don't get me wrong I enjoy long games of 50 to 100+ hours, and I usually enjoy taking the time to scope out every area, get every item, complete every sidequest and gain as high of levels as I can, but I also want to play at my own pace. 2 hours without being able to save is an insane amount of time to require of anybody regardless of the platform they are playing on, regardless if they have the time to play that long or not. But the DS, like most handhelds, are designed for consumers who need the convenience of a game system for when they travel or have little time to play, so this becomes even more mind-boggling.

The Job Class was very cumbersome since you never knew how many battles to raise its level. And since your attacks are capped at 9999, and you don't get anymore abilities than what you start with for a particular job, a lot of the later Job Classes tend to feel obsolete even though they are supposed to be more powerful and effective. More variety in abilities and a level chart were definately needed.

And finally, the Side Quests were just plain idiotic in my opinion. To get most of these, you had to use the Moggle service to send mail, and you needed a friend with a DS in order to accomplish some of that. Does Square Enix (which now includes Eidos, I guess... should I call them Squeido now?) really think the majority of its players want to sit and email friends instead of playing this game? This feature seems to be catering to a younger audience, since I can't think of very many older folks like myself wanting to send email through the DS; however, since the game can be so frustrating at times, younger audiences may choose to ignore this game and find one that is easier to play with perhaps a better story and better game mechanics.

In summary, I can at least say I've completed another number to the Final Fantasy franchise, and I may be willing to give the original NES game a turn if it ever becomes available, perhaps on the Wii platform or some other console. But as for the DS, I don't really recommend it.",0.0051266132814428425

1780,2.0,"Two-and-a-half stars out of five.

Mirror's Edge, from EA DICE, is as far as I know video gaming's first foray into the world of parkour. It executes the subject admirably. The innovative engine it uses to simulate running along rooftops and jumping from foothold to handhold to foothold is excellent; neither so difficult that it quickly becomes frustrating nor so forgiving that the player does not feel like he is working hard for every meter of ground. I frequently found myself holding my breath during particularly challenging leaps. The parkour portion of Mirror's Edge could be a game in itself. In fact, it probably should have been.

I bought Mirror's Edge despite warnings that it contained SWAT teams because I assumed that, as one friend described it, the enemies would be there to discourage slowing down. An important part of parkour is the speed with which one travels from point A to point B, and in a game with a plot that has nothing to do with the sport of parkour, there should be something in place to create a sense of urgency. I do not have a thematic objection to the presence of enemies in the game. Indeed, there are many ways that the police in Mirror's Edge could have been utilized well to encourage constant movement, and on rare occasion the game does hit on one or two of them. Unfortunately, the developers do not seem to have recognized their value, and instead incorporate enemies as an unpredictable and frustrating element of their puzzle construction.

In fact, despite the game's early warnings that hostiles should be avoided rather than fought, Mirror's Edge is constantly putting the player in situations where direct confrontration, if not conflict, is required by the environment. The player's radio contact repeatedly warns her to ""be ready for a fight"" from about the third chapter on. Police appear directly in the path of the player without explanation, even when that path involves overcoming considerable inaccessibility. And these are not the blue-uniformed pistol-bearing cops of the downloadable free demo. These are armored men carrying assault shotguns and rifles, and in some cases 50-caliber machine guns. If there is one message I want to express clearly in this review, it is this: the police are everywhere in this game. Expect the majority of this game to be parkour, but parkour under automatic weapons fire.

Even this could be forgiven, despite the fact that they are armed in this fashion to deal with the threat of a single woman armed only with her speed, if the police had good code governing them. But they do not. There is no stealth system in Mirror's Edge. Enemies become aware of the player when they are activated, regardless of the player's actions or concealment. And once they are aware of the player, they never lose track of her, no matter how insane or hidden her movements. The player will never step out of cover in Mirror's Edge and not be greeted by a hail of bullets. The police can and do track the player around corners and through solid objects.

In many cases, the police do not spawn until the player has wasted too much time in a single area, but this is not universally the case, and there are a few locations in the game that contain enemies from the start and require the player to perform a time-consuming task while there, outside of cover and essentially stationary. The game never explicitly requires combat, but when climbing a pipe or opening a hatch takes two or three seconds, and the pipe or hatch are not protected, failing to deal with the armed men beforehand has predictable results.

In the end, what makes the combat in Mirror's Edge a failure is not its inclusion but its execution. It would have been a simple matter to always have the police in a pursuit role, or if that became too contrived or difficult, to make the player significantly more vulnerable to gunfire while stationary and significantly less vulnerable while moving. Instead, the enemies are often directly in the players' path, and gunfire is extremely erratic, to the extent that the player can make a run under fire without taking a single bullet that on a previous attempt resulted in her being gunned down instantly - and vice versa. If a designer is going to use gunfire in puzzle design, their algorithms for accuracy simply have to be more reliable than that. The demo could be beaten without taking a single bullet by making no more than two well-aimed slide kicks. If the whole game had played like that, this would have been a very different review.

The only thing keeping Mirror's Edge from being a two-star game, despite the excellent parkour engine, is the time trial mode. These are genuinely fun rehashes of the parkour in the game's story mode, often with some changes to the required route to keep things interesting. Unfortunately, in order to unlock these, you have to first beat the story mode of the game. The speedrun mode of the game is just the story mode with a timer attached, and adds no real value. Hopefully, if DICE produces a sequel, they will make the time trials available from the start and will also do something to eliminate or at least reduce the ubiquitous combat content from the original. Mirror's Edge is not the game it should have been.

The final encounter of Mirror's Edge is a short, entertaining boss fight that does not involve combat (only about half the ""boss fights"" in the game don't), but rather quick and skillful use of parkour abilities. I successfully executed the required maneuver first try and happily watched the villain receive his comeuppance, only to then immediately succumb to the numerous high-powered gunshot wounds to my back. The experience defines Mirror's Edge pretty well, in my mind - a good game ruined by poorly designed content that was irrelevant to begin with.

1782,2.0,"Let's face it, American cowboys have gotten far less attention then their Japanese samurai counter-part, it seems like every month we get some new hack 'n slash title full of sweaty samurai. But perhaps the most reasonable explanation to all that could very well be that western games stink. The only bright spots that come to mind are Lucas Art's Outlaws and Konami's Sunset Riders. So attempting at all cost to bring the cowboy back into the picture, perennial controversial-spurring-favorites Rockstar Games have planted for us in the gaming soil Red Dead Revolver.

o discuss Red Dead Revolver without bringing up an issue of just how much explicit graphical nature this game has would be almost unheard, especially taken from the game company that gave us Manhunt and Gran Theft Auto. Much to my surprise, this game didn't really have anything that was over-the-top, it was all kept to a minimum.

You start the game as Red, the lone gunman whose pa' was killed when he was just a young 'un. Much like Conan the Barbarian revenge upon your father's grave is the primary focus for igniting the plot. Think Conan, just not as many governors and well, more sheriffs. The games story mode doesn't play anything similar to Gran Theft Auto, so cancel out any assumption that you'll be robbing people of their wagons and horses to cruise around town--instead the levels are condensed to linear and very tight surroundings. In addition to playing as Red, about 1/4 of the way to finishing the games many levels you'll take control of an additional character, who plays just the same.

Regardless of which character you play as, Red Dead Revolver is a standard action game dressed in a cowboy costume. You manuever around the playing field taking cover from enemy fire, thanks in large part to the backgrounds this isn't much of a problem. What did annoy me was how unresponsive the controls were--Rockstar took a gamble by creating a control scheme too different than everyone elses. The finished results are unpleasent; by moving around with one analog and aiming your gun with the other poses a seroius problem when faced with numerous enemies. Also the inability to quickly change the camera freely led me on many occassions to die without ever knowing who was the culprit responsible for my death. There is a brief moment when you are allowed to use more firepower then usual. This mode is called 'Dead Eye', when you have accumulated the points for ""bullet time"" you can press a button and slow down the camera in a Matrix fashion. Doing so allows you to chain six seperate hit points on the enemies body, after that you can send them straight to the ground. My conclusion on this is, the ability itself sure is useful but a little more creativity would've been nicer. Then at final praise, comes the dualing action the game offers which happens at scripted times of the game. It attempts to simulate a classic gun duel, and to some degree succeeds in authenticating this as a western game. You pull back the analog stick to grab your gun, push it forward to point it at the bad guys, and then giving you a short amount of time to try aiming for the sweet spots before all hell breaks loose. It's a novel concept, but the fact that you can't actually decide when to use it turns it into nothing more than a flashy gimmick.

If I were to choose a version I would go with the Xbox edition, merely based on visuals. The game is a little more polished and the resolution is a few pixels higher, but in the end both PS2 and Xbox versions of Red Dead Revolver suffer from low frame-rates and glitchy looking character models. Character models that a first grader can make out of wooden blocks and construction paper. And some levels really do heighten the amount of suspense higher than what is really offered, take the train stage for example. The music is decent, there are those same tunes that flavored Kill Bill Vol. 2 so well. Too bad the voice acting has to go and screw things up, when I say it's bad I mean its' really BAD. The writing is also poorly done, I understand this is only a game but with so many standards furthering the crossing of movie and game dynamics, cheesy voice acting just doesn't cut it. With a little more freedom to whatever you want to do, better graphics and a more understandable controls--Red Dead Revolver could've been a top choice action game. As it is given to us, it will sell and obtain some acclaim thanks to Rockstars Games' incompetent marketing moves but listen to me, it isn't what the hype makes it out to be.",-0.0037417640490684623

1787,2.0,"Being a long time Xbox 360 owner (until about 6 months ago) it was difficult to adjust to the smaller size PS3 controller and the analog sticks placement, so it was imperative I found a controller that not only worked well at a decent price BUT was designed to look and feel like a 360 controller. For months I had been researching and comparing third party PS3 controllers and it seemed like I would never find a 2nd controller suitable to fit my needs, well alas I am happy to say I finally found one. This controller works as advertised, in fact the sticks feel even better than my dual-shock 3. I've had this controller for about five weeks now and the buttons, triggers and analog sticks feel just as they did when I first took it out of the packaging, and that's playing roughly 10+ hours a week. The blue LED lights although not necessary to use the controller gives it added pizzazz, the two speed fan is really an ingenious idea your hands actually stay dry and comfortable during long gaming sessions, and I love the rubberized grips. The only cons (if you can call it that) are...1) It's not wireless 2) No six-axis 3) You cannot turn PS3 on with the home button (you can however turn it off). These three issues aren't a problem for me because I don't think I've played a game yet in which I absolutely had to use the six-axis feature, and the cable for the controller is about 10 feet long and there is no battery to recharge. There is only one MAJOR problem I did have with purchasing this controller, and it's that I didn't buy it through Amazon...I went off and bought it at Bust Buy paying nearly $10 dollars more. In conclusion, if you are looking for an affordable replacement or 2nd controller for your PS3 that actually works extremely well and don't care about it being wired trust me, this is the controller you want, and Amazon does have the best deal.

UPDATE: My son loved this thing from the moment we received it but alas, it is no more. It has been 10 months from the original purchase date and I am sad and dissapointed to say, the controller has been thrown away. This controller was fun while it lasted but despite the six months or so of usage it just couldn't compare to the official controllers from Sony. It just stopped working one day for no reason. If you need a quick fix and cannot shell out $55+ on an official Sony remote, you can try this one out, after all it is now under twenty dollars so for 6 months or so it isn't too bad of a deal. But if your looking for a long term relationship go with the best.",0.029089786812418694

1789,2.0,"Actually stopped following AC all together after Ubisoft started trying too hard with the Desmond/Ezio's storyline. Decided to try out Unity after reading about Black Flag getting rave reviews, and curious what Ubisoft would do after getting familiarized with the next-gen engine. Overall I'm pretty dissapointed. Starting with the few positives, graphics look pretty mind-blowing but I suggest tinkering with the brightness to get the best picture, personally had to scale mine back to 4. Audio is also a plus; music and sounds are mixed in really well throughout the game. Another positive is that missions now aren't mind-numbingly repetitive like in the past, there's some really cool variety of missions. I got the game a little after launch date so didn't see the bugs that many ppl have mentioned, I assumed the latest patch solved this issue. And the positives stop there for me unfortunately. First off, not a fan of Arno the newest Assassin. He started off having that cool cocky persona like an Ezio, but quickly became soul-less and basically boring after becoming an Assassin. Onto controls, I'm frustrated commonly trying to manuever or scale a building. Perhaps it takes a bit more skill to master, but I remember having much easier of a time in the first few ACs I've played. Combat system is just ok with me. I see it getting a lot of positive reviews but honestly feel like it's still the old wait to parry and finish off deal. Disappointed the combat system hasn't evolved much since the first AC. The biggest disappointment is having to make all these accounts and download this app in order to unlock many rewards and cool things like Altair's master outfit. There's just too much going on in this game making it hard to truly enjoy the experience. As mind-numbingly repetitive as the old ACs were, they were much more enjoyable than the latest iteration.

1790,2.0,"Personal pros and cons

Pros
- to me the games graphics look beautiful.  Everything I had hoped for with almost a painterly style to the background
- they tried to go with something different for the class system which I give them props for and may be a pro to some people since its not the same old same old.
- the story was not hard to follow.  Some games can over do it.
- easy controls

con
- I was not happy with the class system. though i put it in pro, I have my reasons why it is also a con.  It may have been different but I felt they went in the wrong direction with it.  It felt as if (compared to D2 mind you), it had less personal creative expression for each character.  I felt it lacked substance. which took away from some of the depth.  I like to get involved in my character development beyond just a grind or completing quests.  I want my character to be an extension of myself.  I think d2 had the better  class system.
- *This next one may be a little bit of a spoiler to some* - Diablo.. I expected Much more from the final boss.  He was a push over, easily readable and not a real challenge.  I fought elite mobs who gave me more of a challenge.
- the games difficulty feels off to me.
- I didn't feel like I earned much in it.  Gear was easy to get, bosses were easy, most mobs were easy.
- Bosses offered little to no challenge.
- Act 1 was superior to later acts i think.  It felt as if they put more time into than later acts.
- little replay value for me.  It just felt dull to me after you reach a certain point.

I could go on but needless to say I felt they could have done better. I think there was a lack of effort put into multiple areas of the game and even if i hadn't played d1 and d2 I think I would feel the same.  It couldn't keep my interest.  Not for me but maybe it is for someone else.

If the graphics were not as artistic and well done as they where within the confines of the style they went with then I would have given this 1 star.",0.018167756675821194
1791,2.0,"Note:  It's not secret knowledge that FF2 was FF4 in Japan, so I will use both in this review.

I played FF2 for the SNES back in 1991 and still have the original cart.  I loved every aspect and part of that game and I can still remember most of the secrets in it.  Having said this, I have to say that this new version of FFIV is one of the worst games I have ever played on any system, but only because I liked the original so much.  Just like with the more recent Superman vs. the Christopher Reeve Superman, fans of the original game might find their fond memories shattered and ruined as soon as they plug the cart into their DSs.

This game has been almost completely remade for the DS.  This means that the flat, 2D sprites (that were kind of small on the screen) have been replaced by the sock puppet-styled, no nose, spindly leg doll models found in FFIII's remake for the DS.  The backgrounds are nicely updated and even feature some animation.  The battle system is intact, but now there is a victory scene after every single battle that you have to waste 3 or 4 seconds on.  It doesn't seem like a big deal, but you'll quickly find that this grindfest requires you to spend 100 battles leveling up...that 400 seconds you waste is 6 minutes of your life you'll want back.  The music is awful and the script has been doctored to change just about everything from the original.  Let's go through the categories one-by-one.

Graphics:  The increased color palette and 3D engine make for some very nice backgrounds, with much more detail in castles and dungeons.  For instance, the cave leading to the Land of Summoned Monsters (Cave of Eidolons) is replete with creepy spider webs and swampy sludge. The doll-like models for the characters look ugly and blocky, with no mouths or noses and spindly legs.  They look more like small children than heroes.  I personally can't stand seeing them...but some people like them.  Spells are well animated and keep to the original animations.  Of note are the summons, where short cutscenes are welcome and look good.

Sound:  Very, very hit or miss.  Some songs sound just fine, others sound tinny and grating.  The DS's sound engine doesn't have the resonance or the bass of the original SNES FM chip, so, for me, a lot of my favorite songs sounded awful.  I played much of the game with the sound off and just played my mp3 player.  The speech during special cutscenes is corny and poorly done, with melodramatic dialogue.  Only Kain really sounds fitting.

Gameplay:  The original FF2 wasn't so difficult.  This one has had the difficulty ramped up by a factor of 50.  Although nothing has really changed in the main quests, you'll find that almost every normal, random battle either gets half your party killed (usually the spellcasters) or you get your HP dropped to critical.  Pretty much every battle is a boss battle and you will either spend 5 hours grinding XP to level up enough to SURVIVE a trip to a boss, or you will spend 5 hours grinding gil to afford 99 of every healing item you can find, because you WILL use them all.  This game's difficulty can best be compared to making an obstacle course harder by BREAKING YOUR KNEECAPS before you run it.  It's unnecessarily hard and makes the dungeons and walking around annoying and painful.  It gets to the point where you get to the next dungeon and you just don't want to deal with it, anymore.  This is a definite letdown and will turn many casual gamers off from what used to be an awesome, classic game.  The minigames for Fat Chocobo are a distraction, but they're at least doable and a welcome break from the tedium of the main game.

Story:  The basic story is unchanged, but Squeenix took serious liberties with the translation, making it alien to me.  Almost everything has had its name changed, from the spells (going with ____, ______ra, _______raga instead of 1, 2, 3) and filling in the use item list (like Bacchus's Wine instead of just Bacchus).  Also renamed are the Elemental Bosses:  Scarmiglione, something, something, something, instead of Milon, Kainazzo, Valvalis and Rubicant.  Cecil and Kain get a Bomb Ring (wonder what THAT does?) instead of a packet.  The Sand Ruby is called the Sand Pearl.  The dialogue has been embellished with larger words and more of them, but it doesn't add anything to the story.  The poor translation and limited registry space for names in the original had a kind of charm to it.  There's no more carrot for Fat Chocobo, it's Gysahl Greens, now.  The script is annoying to read, as emotions and details are fed to you, removing the need for your imagination to work them out.  Now you even know what everyone sounds like!  The worst part is that, with the advanced difficulty, the dialogue breaks seem like just something to get through to advance to the next 3 hour grind session before you can tackle the next dungeon...

Overall, this game was a huge disappointment.  I played through to the Giant of Babil and returned the game.  I had already spent hours slogging through the Tower of Babil and the Moon and such and didn't feel like spending hours and hours trying and dying to get through the Giant.

I give it 1 star for fun and 2 stars overall because the backgrounds were improved.  I then went back to the GBA release of FFIV, which is superior in every way to this one.",-0.011159485019539521

1795,2.0,"The instruction booklet stinks way too little information and help.

The help screens in the game following a match are on the screen for a millisecond...how am I supposed to read it?

The control for chipping is impossible.  Too light it goes an inch...too hard it goes over the green and out of bounds.  Then when I try somewhere between the two extremes it erratically goes over or is short...way short.  There is NO consistency in chip shots.  I shorten my back swing...no change in the bad result.  If I shorten the back swing and use less down force...no improvement. No combination seems to produce any result even somewhat consistent.

I get the feeling that the game program decides how well or how poorly you will do as you progress through the PGA career mode.  If they want you to do well, all my chip shots are fine.  But if I start doing too well and begin to move to the top of the golfers...BOOM, I get a 6 over par with chip shots and putts that are either too long or too short.  Sometimes I haven't begun my swing and the game does the shot...badly of course.

The game concept is OK but the control one really has with the controller or any semblance of real life is AWFUL.

And how in the heck does one get rid of the annoying mannerisms before and after a shot.  Hunting through the many menus might produce how but I haven't found it yet.

I think I'd rather play the real thing.  This game is overprice and poorly designed.",-0.021455222043457334
1796,2.0,"First of all, I would like to point out the positives--as some others have done. I apologize if it is a bit of a re-hash.

Positive:
1) Gameplay is fun with some good gadgets--hoverboots being easily my favorite.
2) Some of the weapons keep with tradition--good old rocket launchers, pistols, shotgun, ect.
3) Animation is excellent, cutscenes are beautiful and brilliantly executed.
4) Layout of worlds was well balanced.

Negatives... there are many:
1) The gameplay is difficult to some degree, but I completed this game on medium difficulty in around 9-11 hours... This includes doing all the Clank side dealies.
2) Speaking of Clank--it feels so stupid without him the entire game. This game should be called ""Ratchet Over Here and Clank Way the Heck Over There Somewhere with a Time Wand and a Robot That Got Badly Beaten with the Ugly Stick.""
3) Some of the weapons are poor and copies from earlier games. We have two weapons in this game alone that shoot sharp discs. Not too original there.
4) The gear was lacking and was inexpensive. No real challenge to earn them.
5) The story was lacking and cliche. I expected so much more from all the hype. General Azimuth is so god-awful boring it almost causes fans to tear at his stupidity. The story amounts to nothing more than a soap opera. The fans don't even get to see a nostalgic flashback of Ratchet's parents or anything. So much could have been done... Incredibly disappointing plot.
6) As I said, the layout of the worlds was really nice, with some great grinding and hoverbooting here and there. Other than that, the placement of key things like the gold bolts and whatnot seemed like an afterthought.
7) The space parts were incredibly boring. The fact that the aircraft is limited to a single plane of flying, ((Meaning no flying up or down peoples!!)). The weapons you get from the Zoni are overpowered, meaning any 'challenge' is a complete breeze. I didn't die in outer space a single time--not even to those fat robot chicks they call the 'Valkyries'.
8) The moons you travel to in space... To get the Zoni and gold bolts and all that--> Once you've explored one... You've explored them all. Trust me. I would rather scrap all the moons in the entire game to get another entire planet to explore... Which leads to my next point.
9) Worlds to explore. What were there, like 5? Sure the layouts and graphics are amazing but C'MON! I remember reading an article that Tools of Destruction used only like 30 percent of the PS3's power while this game uses like 90-100 percent of it. Where did it all go? I'm completely serious.
10) Not enough Qwark. I know you might be wondering what I'm thinking saying this--but I was under the impression Qwark would hang around for some time, and give some great comic relief. ""It's like time is all... not working.""
11) Did I mention too easy? Can't hold a candle to colisseum rampages back in Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal.
12) Some controls were glitchy with slingshots and other things, leading to deaths down chasms that couldn't be avoided unless I made perfect landings.
13) Clank's side quests with the time clock. They serve no purpose to the actual story and the temporal recording sequences are lame. I would like to ask for a replica of Ratchet's wrench so that I might beat Sigmund over the head with it.

If you are a returning fan to this series, or someone coming upon this game as a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you wait until this game becomes a PS3 Greatest Hits title. I felt that this game deserved something more like two and a half stars in all honesty, but having to choose between 2 or 3 stars--> I would have to say definitely 2 stars.

If Insomniac chooses to do a sequel and continue the series, I hope that they will try to go back to their roots and rediscover what made Ratchet & Clank so enjoyable. Perhaps they can reverse the downward slide they've been on since Deadlocked. As the saying goes: Only time will tell.",0.0438723668499129

1799,2.0,"Sadly, most of the game's detractors are correct.  I really liked the original Max Payne and loved Max Payne 2.  I've played both many times over.  Here we have Max Payne 3 and it is quite a departure from the first 2.  For starters, Max doesn't slowly wend his way thru the New York streets but has been transplanted to Sao Paulo, Brazil of all places!  Not too sure how great an idea this was and it begs the question, why not just stay in New York?  Consequently, that slick gritty Noir feel is lacking in this game.  Truly this is more like Max meets Miami Vice.  I find it annoying that all the baddies are rattling off Portuguese(The Brazilian language) and, unless you understand it, they might as well be speaking Chinese. It made me realize that Portuguese isn't as close to Spanish as I thought.  I know some Spanish and couldn't make heads or tails out of what these guys were saying.  Much of this could be forgiven but the game simply doesn't play like the others.  In MP1 & 2 you controlled Max as he made his way thru the streets of NY.  In this game most of the time there will be a (too long) cut-scene followed by Max being positioned behind a desk or some such object and you will have to fight it out with mucho bad guys.  And be prepared to die... a lot!  You will make your way thru a bunch of bad guys only to come across a second wave and realize you're out of painkillers and your health is low...then dead!  Hit retry and start that section over again because this game has those hated checkpoints, no quick-saves folks!  I played it on normal difficulty but, unless you're pretty good with shooters like this and can take dying a whole bunch of times, you might want to try easy mode.

There are many little annoyances that make things unfun. You'll be looking for that crappy white reticule to aim properly.  This had me curse the game many times.  It's tiny and can be hard to see depending on the background.  Also, more often than not Max will be dumped amongst a ton of guys holding his pistol even though he was just using a machine gun before the cut-scene.  And yes, there are way too many cut-scenes in this damn game.  They tried too hard to make this feel like a movie or something.  Note to game developers-Don't take anymore playing time away from the player than necessary.  Seriously, almost every time Max approaches a slightly open door, you lose control and the cut-scene takes over.  It gets to be quite tiresome.  On the plus side the graphics are truly stunning.  About halfway thru, Max shaves his head(why?) and begins in the slums of Sao Paulo and I marveled at all the visual detail.  But, of course, graphics alone can't save a game.  Maybe if there were quick-saves instead of checkpoints my rating would be higher.  But overall I found myself too pissed half the time to say I enjoyed this game.  I also don't like so much control being taken away from me, the gamer.  My advice is wait until it goes on sale.  I got it off Steam when they were having a 75% off sale so it only cost me $9.99.  I certainly wouldn't pay $40 for it.",-0.012404643093497583

1804,2.0,"While this game doesn't represent the very worst experience I've had this gen, it almost assuredly is at least the second biggest letdown... It's so shameful however, as in development this game seemed to offer trademark Soul Calibur gameplay that was simply a bit modernized and of course included some guest characters to attract casual fans... The game almost exclusively appeals to the casual and/or RPG market though, which is my primary gripe with it...

While my greatest worry with reference to the game's reported development was the ""critical finish"" system, this gameplay mechanic is actually very peripheral and difficult to achieve, and so that was one thing I was relieved about upon playing this game... What's not made very explicit within any official review I read (most notably IGN's own review) is how much effect character customization has on general gameplay. Representing one of the bad turns (if not the very worst) of creative direction of III to IV, rather than just affecting the aesthetic, a character's equipment now grants them ""skill points"" or what's generally equivalent to attribute points within most RPGs... There are four categories which these points can count towards, and depending how many points you have within each one you are able to select specific skills which will grant different exotic effects to whatever character the points correspond with.... Conceptually this might seem cool - especially to the markets I referenced earlier - but anyone expecting a pure/competitive worthy/balanced fighter will immediately be turned off. Referencing things objectively, there are a few modes that don't have equipment have any weight over gameplay, though exclusively referencing singleplayer, the only mode that such an idea can be said about is by far the most barebones.

With reference to the game's singleplayer, there's very little special about this game... As just mentioned, there is a very basic ""arcade mode"" present; although it's extremely basic this will probably be the favored mode of anyone who considers themself specifically a fighting fan rather than just a general gaming fan. While I don't dislike the arcade mode, in many ways it seems like players are discouraged from playing that mode rather than all others, with very few achievements derived from playing it, and generally speaking the least money gained by playing it once through...

To reference the other modes, of course there's a story mode, but unlike its predecessor, it's incredibly barebones... Rather than be granted plot lines in the form of visual exposition, the player is granted a wall of text which is pretty much the entirety of a ""story's"" involvement with story mode... As you face characters within said mode, some will make oblique references to key character traits and/or plot elements, but that's all that can be said aside from the characters' endings, most of which are also very oblique and really lacking in emotionality and/or anything generally compelling. All of said statements are intensified contrasted with the greatness that was Soul Calibur III's ""Tales of Souls"" mode, offering some RPG-like single-player progressive options, text which would further the story in a very logical and successive manner, and could be read completely optionally between each stage, (rather than the single wall encountered within SC IV's mode) and of course the event battles each with specialized dialogue corresponding with each character uniquely... Said mode was truly iconoclastic by the standards of the fighting genre's story involvement, and it's a travesty that Namco couldn't have developed a ""story"" mode more closely following within this one's footsteps...

Of all the singleplayer modes, the one that was obviously focused on the most while the game was being developed was the ""Tower of Lost Souls"" mode... Here the equipment effects prove the most prominent, and the player is mandated to customize their character if they actually want to stand a chance of doing well within this mode... Frankly I think I've stated enough of my opinions on the equipment, which overall correlate with my opinions towards this mode, though some people may derive some enjoyment from it if they actually enjoy customization and/or want a genuine challenge (albeit a challenge that isn't so because of well coded AI or any other reason more befitting of a fighting game...).

By most gamers' standards, a fighting game's singleplayer modes are mitigated by its multiplayer, though for the most part, the criticisms still stand... There's a versus standard mode, which is the game at its core... While this is still prefereable to the ""special"" mode, the animation looks choppy contrasted with III, the game seems even more imbalanced than before, and overall it's generally a let down. Of course the special mode is the game with weapon effects incorporated, and once again is most heavily catered towards the RPG crowd... As if the general low quality of said multiplayer modes weren't bad enough, the game's netcode seems to be the worst I've experienced aside from pretty much any SNK game... Even on the highest quality connections, (those with ratings of ""5"" or ""blue) I experienced a very large amount of input delay... When I hosted matches, this effect seemed even more prominent (how this is the case I have no idea, but I'm pretty sure I wasn't imagining that). Many hardcore fighting fans will state the fact that a player shouldn't judge a game's quality by the standards of its online modes, but considering how many achievements are tied with online play, my experiences were so bad even while hosting or on very optimal connections, and that this game is developed by major developer Namco, I think said point is definitely worthy of mentioning.

There's a bit more to games than gameplay, that much is true, but generally speaking Soul Calibur IV doesn't deliver there either... A lot of the stages that recurred from III feature themes similar in nature to said game, but overall of lesser quality. Overall the voice acting is lower quality as well, with most returning actors voicing their characters flatter than before... I reluctantly state this, as said person is also my generally favorite voice actress, but Jennifer Hale's new style of manic voice for Tira is beyond awful... I'm assuming this was a director's decision, so I don't blame her specifically, but I found the character very compelling within III and I can't say that with reference to her incarnation within IV (within that vein the new style of character design is also way too drastically different, but said point is kind of pedantic I'll admit). The only characters' voices I think are improved from III to IV are Nightmare's and Setsuka's, (due to the heavy distortion of the voice, I don't know if Nightmare's voice actor is the same within both games) and the only character who has a voice on par with their incarnation within III is Siegried (the pitch is notably different, but for whatever reason I think both voices fit the character).

To reference a few arbitrary things, the Star Wars characters are blatant gimmicks, but I think most people who've played pretty much any SC game before this one can realize that for themselves. To give the game its deserved credit, I can't complain at all about the game graphically... The facial models look incredibly lifelike, (frankly I do find myself attracted to a few of the girls in the game, despite the fact I know they are not real) the backgrounds are incredibly lush and vibrant, and it's quite possibly the very best looking game I've played on the 360 overall... Graphics are least important when it comes to game design though, and so even this credit I'll give it will not be enough for me to grant this game a greater than mediocre score... With the quality of this iteration considered, I really hope Namco can salvage the franchise and deliver a truly worthy successor to III, but it seems like Namco is deliberately making Soul Calibur casually appealing, and if that's their choice as to where to take the franchise, I doubt my hopes will ever become realized....",0.0027809006747147006

The graphics, although apparantly take a lot of system resources to run, remind me of the old Nintendo/Arcade game ""paperboy"". The movement and detail of the characters are about the same and look very underdeveloped.
The game does have a lot of potential. There is a large variety of stores, products, and decorations you can select from to build several floors worth of mall. However, the purpose and goals of the game are vague. The in-game help and descriptions are limited and the play is not as user-friendly as other games in this genre.

You do have control of the store names and some details, but there is no control or details about the customers that roam your mall.

1812,2.0,"This is a review for the downloadable Burst DLC only, not the full retail disc version. The original Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 game is a masterpiece for the most part... but this DLC? not so much... The DLC adds a new boss battle,new playable character, 100 battle challenge mode, some enhanced visuals and some unlockable images.. and that's it.. not really worth it and i'll tell you why..
the Challenge missions are fun, and what you'll spend most of your time with since it's the only new content that takes time to beat.

The ""New Chapter"" is misleading.. it's not a new chapter it's just an impossible to win, complete unfair, frustraing boss battle with you playing as Itachi and Sasuke against the Sage Mode form of Kabuto. Kabuto has 2 battles.. the first one is winnable but the second  he has  5, yes 5 health bars! that take little damage which drags the battle out for a while. If you fail, and you will fail.. every time.. you can have to restart the battle at the second part of the battle where he gains his 5 health bars, but the difficulty remains the same, instead of of being lowered so you can win it like in the other boss battles from the original Naruto Shippuden UNS 3 game did... essentially, not matter how good you get.. the boss battle isn't winnable and is extremely frustrating..

The ""HD Visuals"" that were supposedly enhanced for the Burst DLC  aren't a mixture of visuals that only look slightly better, some blurry ones that actually look worse the the original's graphics, and ones that looks the same and were untouched.

The only other good thing about the DLC besides the Challenge missions is the ""new"" character Sage Mode Kabuto ( i say ""new"" because he could have had sage mode as an awakened form (and probably did at some point in the game's production before it was presumably was put on hold in order to make more money and release it as DLC) he is a good new character.. but $10 for one character and some quick challenge missions isn't really worth it.. even if you get the retail version which includes the all the DLC costumes it still isn't worth it since the costumes are just cosmetic.

 So to recap.. one new character. an impossible, frustrating boss battle. partially enhanced ( and partially worse) visuals, new challenge mode for $10 is a rip off big time.. don't bother getting the DLC unless you just want Sage Mode Kabuto are willing to pay $10 for one character..",-0.03379214459882181

1816,2.0,"There are some great features of the xbox one, like the ability to add a tv tuner and/or run hdmi passthrough for whatever device you want, like a cable box, or even a Roku.  But this is about the most unpolished experience I've ever had, and it's been out for years.  If you buy an xBox One instead of a PC because you think it's gonna be more reliable, think again.

1.  Downloaded games sometimes just won't work.  xBox Fitness was a prime example.  Downloaded, launched, and it just hung on the disclaimer screen during launch.  Uninstalled, reinstalled, and it worked fine.

2.  Of course, once I got xBox Fitness up and running, I realized that the Kinect still has a long way to go.  The field of view is just stupid narrow.  I'm 6'3, and standing 8' away cuts off my head and don't even think about getting more than one person in frame at that distance.

3. You can just leave the console and walk away, and it will go into something like a sleep mode, allowing you to resume your game right where you left off when you return.  When it works, this is awesome.  Problem is, it never works.  The game always seems to freeze when I return.

4.  The controller pairing also gets thrown out of whack when you resume from this sleep mode.  While the controller will work fine in the xBox dashboard, once you're in game, you'll have to turn it off and back on to repair it so that the game recognizes it.

5. The side snap feature could be nice, but it's a nightmare to use.  I've been fiddling with it for a week and I'm still not sure how it works.

6.  You're forced to install the game before you can play (at least with most games).  For Madden '15, for example, it took about a half hour to install, and when it was finally done, I still have to insert the disc to verify ownership.  Stupid.  You should be able to transfer ownership to a digital copy that is tied to your account so you don't have to get up to swap discs every time you want to switch games.

7.  The controller is great, except the thumbsticks have a small basin on the top, and the edge of that basin basically collects dead skin and whatever else is on your thumbs.  It's nasty, especially when it's someone elses skin that's in there.

8.  The graphics are a step up from the 360, but in most games, I don't really feel like it makes a huge difference.

9.  Paying $50 a year for multiplayer seems more and more ridiculous when I've literally NEVER paid for multiplayer on PC.

I've been a PC game for years, and just recently sold my dust-collecting 360 to buy a One.  It's not on par w/ PC gaming.  I got it because I felt like I  would have access to more games, especially sports games...but in reality, the only gaming experience I couldn't get on the PC was football, and Madden is horrible, so it's not like I would have missed that.  FIFA is avail on PC.  NBA 2K is avail on PC.  There are lots of racing games...there are FPS, strategy, RPG, etc.  I should have followed my gut and got a Steam Link, but oh well.  My gf will enjoy being able to pause live TV again, and I do love Forza.  Other than that, I'll probably stick to the PC.  It's more reliable.  It's faster.  Better graphics.  It can take advantage of my 21:9 monitor.  Game sales are more frequent and lucrative.  There's better controller support.  Because xBox One threw away the one thing consoles had going for them (rock solid reliability), they are really nothing more than a cheap old PC w/ a proprietary front-end/game system.",0.03913543620428792

The degree of the chase camera view is off, which makes it hard to see oncoming objects, and night time setting doesn't help either. There are a bunch of balance issues, but here is what is cool: setting up your handling just right to get a real nice grip or drift car, variation of races (drift races were my favorite), and 90% easy achievements (if your the kind that likes to bump up your gamer score). So the only point of getting this game is to raise your gamer score. Other than that don't buy it or wait till its super cheap.",0.005583210649000123

Once you get all set up, you realized that as you turn the wheel, there is nothing to anchor the base. to imagine trying to drive your car but steering wheel column keeps shifting on you. In addition (the pedals have the same exact problem). It's very sensitive. You may be able to change a setting somewhere but I didn't look long enough to find it. As the wheel snaps back to the 12 O' clock position, it wobbles back and forth a bit which makes your car go all over the road. This would be manageable if not for the first problem.

1826,2.0,"Okay. The big thing with me is the game is a ""What-if?"" scenario. ""What-if"" Ash never went back in time, ""Army of Darkness"" never would have happened, and instead Ash was arrested and put in a mental institution. This is like saying, ""What if Marty never went back to the 1950's in ""Back to the Future"" part 1, but instead helped Doc fight terrorists. Guess what? If Marty never went back it would suck and there would be no point to continue a story in that direction. It would be horrible. Just like this game.

  Yeah, the controls and gameplay aren't horrible. I was in the woods in broad daylight in one level, and I'm like,""Umm, this isn't that entertaining or scary..."" The levels are kind of cool, but nothing to flip out about. Ash also has a harpoon for an arm as an optional weapon. Just stick to the chainsaw people! Now it's just getting fruity with all the weapons, like the flamethrower, blood sucking piece of crap thing that doesn't really work, and probably the dumbest weapon ?MACHINE GUN? A lot of those weapons were from ""Fistful of Boomstick."" But this game just helps keep a horrible tradition going. Also, some of the enemies are dumb. Like the flying ones, the big fat thing Sam rides on, and the ones that look like the grim reaper. Totally out of place. And there's one part where Ash has to defend Sam against the flying guys and that part sucked. I had to redo it because a lot of my shots went through a certain enemy at a certain point.  Yes, one good film franchise is being gutted and stuffed with fruity elements of Today's all too horrible video games when it gets adapted to the video game medium! Stupid enemies, stupid weapons, (This is based on the ""Evil Dead"" film franchise people, stick to the things that made the film franchise so great!)  and stupid characters you don't care about i.e. Sam.

  When someone was on drugs they thought it would be a good idea to give Ash a sidekick who is more humorless and annoying than helpful.

Rogue was a step-down, but then came Unity.  A prelude that set the stage for extremely ""drab"" with Syndicate.  The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is for the ""architect"" of the external buildings and the trains, as well as it had far fewer glitches than Unity.  But even Unity had more exciting buildings to enter and things to do.

If it were not for my paying $60 for the new game at a local store, another $30 to download more content in hopes of something exciting happening, and $24 for a strategy guide that I absolutely did not need, I would've stopped playing it during Sequence 5.  Why?

It became tedious to repeatedly drive swaying stage coaches through similar looking streets.  In Rogue, the ships were awesome, battles happened on various seas and weather conditions, there were many ports to dock a ship, and etc.  The same ole' happens over-and-over with coaches.

1829,2.0,"Product: Pure Chess (PS4) by VooFoo Studios
Rating: 2/5 (below average)

I bought this game directly from the PSN as a Digital Download.  I have very mixed feelings about it.

Likes:
* Nice graphics, looks very attractive.
* Includes a minimal tutorial on how the different pieces move, but that's pretty much it.
* Includes 100 chess problems, involving mate in 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 moves (20 problems each).
* The AI on setting 1 is useless, but once you move up to setting 3 or 4 the AI becomes quite challenging.  However, the increased difficulty is more than offset by an inability to resign a losing game (see below).

Dislikes:
* UNABLE TO RESIGN (-1 star): There does not appear to be a way to resign a game against the AI if you're losing. I am literally gobsmacked that they neglected to code such an essential capability, and its absence seriously affects playability.  If anyone figures out how to do it, please post a comment.
* NO SUPPORT (-1 star): There is apparently NO support for this product VooFoo Studio's forum ... as of this writing, numerous requests for help spanning several months, and bug reporting by several other users, have all gone unanswered for many months.  There doesn't appear to be any third party site fulfilling the role either, so anyone looking for support on this software is going to have a frustrating time of it.
* BUGGY (-1 Star):  Several trophies are bugged, poorly designed, or both.  I've also read a lot of complaints online about the server being down, and being unable to select non-random opponents.  After several failed attempts to connect myself, I eventually gave up.
* ADD-ONS:  I cant really single out VooFoo on this, since EVERYONE does it, but the game only comes with a few basic chess piece styles, and only 3 choices of boring and unchanging music.  There are some really beautiful pieces available for download, but you guessed it, they all cost extra, and there are no upgrades to the music, even for money.  IMO, you're better off simply muting the game and turning on your stereo.

Bottom line:  This game is pretty, and I very much wanted to enjoy and play it, but the missing resign capability, the apparent lack of support by VooFoo, and ongoing problems with their server, have all soured the experience for me, and I've since uninstalled the game.  I recommend saving your money and looking elsewhere for a more complete program that is actually supported by the people who wrote it.

1831,2.0,"The Sims: Bustin' Out is a goal-oriented, console-style version of The Sims. The gameplay has been slightly watered-down, and given a more simplistic feel. Really, I think Bustin' Out was aimed at a somewhat younger audience.

The concept of the game is fun, however. You create your own 'sim' and control them in order to accomplish goals, make friends, and earn money. (To furnish your home with.) The game starts you out on your uncle's farm, where you become familiarized with some of the gameplay mechanics. Afterwards, you are sent out to explore SimValley, and meet its various denizens. From there, you will stumble upon various goals and will be required to fulfill them before moving on. After completing every goal in every chapter, you finish the game.

Unfortunately, it seems that the game was either rushed, or under-funded, as the graphics are not as up to par as they should be. In addition to this, there are several glitches which can cause certain goals to become unavailable, or incompletable. (Thus ruining any chance of actually finishing the game.) There seems to be no way around these glitches, either.

After having completed the game myself, I was sorely disappointed with the rewards of having done so. However, I will not spoil it for those who've yet to finish the game themselves. Regardless, I do think the gameplay is fun, in its own right. You won't find much entertainment in actually completing the game itself, though.

1835,2.0,"Oh wow....I remember playing this colossal flaming pile of turd. A friend of mine rented this game from Blockbuster for a couple of days. And I wished we both could have taken back the time we wasted.

They had great ideas for this game: You take Sub Zero from the Mortal Kombat series, use this opportunity to tell people more about his back story and his battle against monks, set it in cool locales and incorporate MK inspired game play and controls in an action adventure, side scroller with light RPG influences. What could possibly go wrong??? How about....EVERYTHING in this game.

First off, Sub Zero walks and controls like a robot. Second, this game uses every button on the controller (you even have a separate button to hit when you want him to face the direction to walk!) Third, you unlock his special moves as you progress through the game and while many use the same directional pad + button combinations in Mortal Kombat, they are 100 times harder to pull off. The bosses are petty damn hard so expect to die a lot. The graphics and sound do their job in setting the mood for the game, while the music is standard MK and kung fu inspired theatrical sounding. The PS1 version features full motion cut-scenes between the stages you fight in while the N64 gets the standard static artwork.

I give it two stars for the cool music and graphics for its time. But that alone will not make a great game. You may be tempted to pick this up if you love Mortal Kombat and the price is right.

1847,2.0,"I think of the hunting games as being casual gamer friendly. I consider an advanced gamer, so I was surprised by how tough this seems. It took me a couple tries to get through all the stages in the first level and I could not beat the second level without putting the game on easy! (couldn't get past it on normal after many tries!)

Hunting games don't really hold my interest, but I thought it would be a good game for the nieces and nephews. They enjoy many of the wii hunting games. But I know they would have less patience with this game than I do.

It's not that I can't shoot the deer, but the missions often require you to shoot say 5 bucks. Then sometimes you only see the 5 bucks you're supposed to shoot. You have 3 minutes to shoot 5 bucks. You miss the second buck because you were fending off a moose at first, you scrolled to the other side really fast, and your one shot at it missed. Then for the next two minutes, you're perfect but because you only saw 5 bucks in the 3 minutes you lose! And if this was the second stage of the level, you have to restart the whole level. I'm not sure if the aiming is poor or whether it's just too hard and exact. Either way, I should be able to get past the first world on easy! But even on easy, I fail once in a while and I still haven't beaten the first boss after many tries. And I'm giving up.

The graphics are ok, but seem in-between a ds game and 3ds game. The sound isn't bad, but there's nothing memorable. There is a lot of customization, and you can play with the stylus or analog stick. There are left handed options which is great! This is one of the few games that the 3d effect strains my eyes at full.

In the missions I played they all were the same type, you stay in one spot while looking around for things to shoot. Many of the wii games have you walk around between shooting animals and I miss that. There are different mission types that are very similar (shoot so many buck, shoot so many buck that are at a certain distance, tag so many doe). The mission type seems to be random because if you try a level multiple times, you'll get different mission types each time. Then the final insult to injury is that sometimes you get a mission where the goal is to not shoot more than three doe. It sounds nice to have an easy mission once in a while, but do you really want a mission where the goal is to not do anything for three minutes?

I love video games. I consider myself a hardcore video gamer who doesn't look down on the casual selections that I play with my family. But this isn't the casual game that a hardcore gamer hates. This is a dud. You may not find another 3ds hunting game, but there are tons of these games for the wii. I know the nephews recently played through Remington Hunting Africa and they had a lot of fun (for less than $10!).",0.012161036828524511
1848,2.0,"SimCity had SO much great potential to be everything we all wanted and more. Unfortunately, EA had to decide to give us players absolutely nothing that we wanted and make us ""rent"" their game at the cost of sixty dollars minimum in order to actually use it, rather than own it.

THE PROS:

* Really nice graphics.

* Building add-ons and upgrades.

* The simulation aspects of the city itself are very good.

* The gameplay is easier and more user-friendly.

* The ability to individually follow a Sim or a vehicle, though you won't be able to label them or ""create Sims"" to keep track of.

* Great Works, massive city-sized projects, being a new introduction into the series, gives you something major to work towards.

THE CONS:

* Always have to play online. Perhaps the BIGGEST flaw of all. You CANNOT PLAY WITHOUT A REALLY HIGH-SPEED INTERNET CONNECTION. It is REQUIRED! If you have a slow internet connection, you're screwed. If you don't have home internet access, you're screwed. You have to log into Origin, and then play the game off of EA's servers. As you may or may not be well aware of now, the EA servers are atrociously bad. And what will happen ten years from now if anyone wanted to play this game? I still play Sim City 4 and that was released ten years ago.

* Server issues, of course. They suck and their terrible-ness isn't going away anytime soon. This is a separate issue by EA, unrelated to the Always Online issue. During the first two weeks, most players couldn't even get INTO the servers. These problems will likely be fixed over time, but the Always Online requirement likely won't ever away.

* Can't save your own city (its auto-save) and can't reload anything. You cannot test or experiment anything in your city to see how it works, because of this. Also, because of the server issues, you very well could lose everything due to the auto save feature. Or, if you can't get back onto your local server and have to use another one.

* Limited city size. Most people's OTHER glaring, giant flaw in the overall game. This really should be called ""SimTown (2013)"". The size is only about a 2 square kilometer area. Or 400 square city blocks, at its maximum peak. This is much smaller than it sounds, and a full entire city can be made in about an hour. You'll get about another hour or two out of it upgrading and trying to maximize everything to peak efficiency, so... up to three hours, on average, is what you're looking at for a fully complete city, here.

* You cannot, for the most part, build a fully functioning city, by yourself. While with some, it is possible, the game is really set up so that you more-or-less have to trade resources with other cities in order to properly function. This was their vision when they made the game. They wanted it to be an interactive social experience. Otherwise, the multiplayer would merely optional for those who want it, not so heavily encouraged to the point where they try to force you to use it in order to get a fully functional city. As for trading resources... you can either do this with other players online if your region is publicly open, or if you're like me, you'll prefer a private region that only you control. However, if you do a private one, you'll constantly be hopping between cities once you hit a peak or barrier for resources. If you do an open region, you'll have to rely on strangers to help you build your city and assuming the server DOESN'T shut down on them, they lose their cities, they don't troll, or they don't just forever abandon their city that your town is forced to rely on, they still more than likely will mess you up more than help you. Problems in other cities affect yours, and how many people would really care or be considerate enough to not cause problems to your own city, especially in cases where it won't affect theirs?

To put it in other words, Forced Multiplayer and cooperation kills any single-player fun to be had. Unless you play with personal friends and they all think like you do and you can all work towards a common goal, this will surely be more of a hindrance than if you could just play fully alone. This is beyond forced and unnecessary. You can build a great city entirely on your own, but you have to be an true expert player in order to do so. Its very hard.

* Speaking of which... Specialized cities are more-or-less mandatory instead of merely optional. Because every city on the region needs to support each other, SOMEone's going to have to build an industrial city. And someone's going to have to be a mining city, garbage city, cheap commercial city, etc. Sucks all the fun and imagination out of it all, just like modern-day Lego kits.

* Also... the interface is pretty much the same way. Much more user-friendly and simple, but offers FAR less creativity, as well. Every single possible thing in the city has to be linked by roads. Can't build a park or anything out in the middle of nowhere. Can't build a cabin up in the woods. Can't build a mountain retreat to have an isolated Mayor's Mansion at. And so on. Also, the zoning for neighborhoods also offers less freedom. You have to zone by road size, now. The ONLY upside to this is that roads also now take care of any power and water requirements, so having to build power lines and pipes are no longer necessary. Though some people won't like this newly added shortcut (I am one of them) because pipelines weren't that big of a major hindrance in past games, to begin with. The road system causes more problems than solutions, especially in a designated space smaller than most major city's downtown districts.

* No terraforming or creating your own custom regions. It is absolutely impossible to affect the natural resources of the land, like creating rivers, digging lakes, or forming mountains. Oh, and the pre-made choices aren't really that great, either. This also leads to monotomy and the same boring terrains every time.

* No option to skip tutorials. They are long, boring, lame, and there every time you start a new region/city. Apparently, you can exit out of the city to avoid having to fully go through them, though.

* Many things missing from previous SimCity installments, like subways or well, ANYthing underground. These will likely be sold as exorbitantly high DLC's.

* The Sims are glitched/flawed. The way the Sim Agents work is: A sim will go from a house and work a job. Then, go home at the end of the day. Only problem is, no sim ""owns"" their own home, and they just go to empty houses/jobs by proximity and occupancy, so they really don't ""own"" individual jobs, either. This will result in whatever businesses that are furthest away from your residental Sims to fail, because the Sims will never travel that far until all the other occupancies/jobs are filled up, first. So, you could have several over-crowded businesses near your residental homes, and several abandonded/empty jobs further away from your houses that they fail to reach because they're 'too far away.' This is also why traffic jams occur frequently despite how man bus stops you put down and why businesses seemingly fail for 'no reason.' In order for it to work functionally, you'll have to plan to put your top businesses or factories near the entrance of the city and your residental areas somewhere in the middle of town, or close to one designated spot where jobs are. Spread anything out or place jobs in different parts of the city besides one spot, and chaos will ensue.

Overall, this SimCity game could've been SO close to perfect had EA not deliberately chose to ruin it with their horrible and likely greed-inspired choices. Merely not forcing players to have to always be online with a high-speed internet connection, not forcing them to have to rely on their laggy and buggy servers, not forcing multiplayer on one of the only truly Single-Player Gaming franchises out there, and NOT giving us such small city-size limitations could've and probably would've made this game a perfect SimCity/city managing simulator (even with minor bugs, aside).

But as it is in reality right now, it is a forced Massive Multiplayer Online experience (not even true multiplayer, but rather a 'multiple single-player community') that has you building tiny two-by-two square kilometer towns where resources are always limited and there's always a very good chance you'll lose your entire city and everything in it.

Again, allowing us the FREEDOM to play this game by ourselves, offline, with actual city-building space would've likely made this game near perfection. But as it stands now (especially at sixty dollars), it is not worth your time, money, or attention.

Remember Mass Effect 3's ending (if you've ever played that before)? What is it with EA and upsetting their fans every March? It doesn't take a genius to figure out all they need to do. Its mind-numbingly simple; so dumb, anyone can figure it out. Give the fans what they want and they'll give you their money! Win/Win. THQ - an extremely horrible gaming company that cut corners and ripped customers off in the most extreme ways - learned this lesson the hard way. They are now bankrupt and deservedly so. EA has screwed up time and time again in the past, and their customs of restricting players' freedom and greedily high-pricing them and ripping them off with DLC/expansion packs will not go unpunished. Fans can be very vocal about this and I know most companies likely won't care about fan complaints, especially over the internet. However, when customers speak with their wallets, shareholders and investors also become very unhappy and companies fail and die off. You simply CANNOT be successful while cutting corners, taking away freedoms, and upsetting all your loyal customers. Game companies aren't like McDonalds or Comcast cable.

Again: It's simple! Give us what we want and we'll give you all our money! Up until their ending, Mass Effect, developed by BioWare and published by EA, got this 100% right. But then, they didn't and boy, did that hurt them. But it seems EA refuses to learn from their mistakes. Funny thing is, EA's quality isn't even as bad as THQ's was. THQ made terrible games, and made terrible game decisions on purpose, AND ripped off their customers with pure greed as their intentions. EA at least, has quality games, yet they still manage to p! ss off their fanbase just as badly.

As we stand, we have a SimCity game that was developed wonderfully by Maxis and ruined, at least in part, by EA and their ""Always Online"", ""Always co-dependent on other players"" bone-headed executive mistakes to maximize profits and minimize quality or player freedom. By the way, the game could've been fully functional offline, and one of the main reasons they did this is to prevent ""piracy,"" which is ALWAYS a greed-based decision. (5% of players pirate the game, so 95% have to suffer for it?)

SimCity is a game that could've been, but never was. And its painful to see what a fun game this could've been, but ended up turning into, due to technical crap. Because of the possibilities for a great game, I can't in all honesty, give this 1 out of 5 Stars. And the game WOULD'VE been awesome, had it not been so restrictive and buggy. But it is, and they ruin any possibilities for the true great gaming experience this could've been. While there may always be hope for the future, such as a console-ported version that addresses and fixes all of the current mistakes of this release, as it stands now, SimCity 2013 is not worth your time, not worth your hard-earned money, and not worth your attention, at all. It pains me to have to say this, but when companies mess up this big and royally, they have to be held accountable. Someone deserves to get fired immediately over this. SimCity is THAT bad.

1849,2.0,"I admit, I held off on this one after all the bad press and waited to snag it at a discount. Glad I did, as while it isn't as terrible as some let on, if I had paid full price for this game I would have felt cheated. It is shiny and slick, but any relation this game has to the Metroid mythos is pretty paltry. Stick any other character in there instead of Samus and it wouldn't have made much difference; the bounty hunter is pretty much gone here and it's kinda just a soap opera in space. The gameplay itself is just OK and you can get the hang of it pretty quickly; then just rinse/repeat to the end (dodge, shoot, dodge, and over and over). Much prefer the Metroid Prime series and that's the one I'll continue to replay in the future; this one will probably just sit on the shelf and may end up next to the other two or three I've seen at my local Goodwill (not kidding on this last).",0.0084676126342793
1850,2.0,"Gameplay is average but what really brings its score down is written below:

Greediness
Wouldn't you know it, thanks to their succes with WoW, Blizzard has found a new and insulting way to turn ALL of their games into more money - charging $10 higher per game and breaking it up into 3 separate purchases - thus forcing their fans to buy 2 more """"expansions"""" if they want a complete game.  And that's not even mentioning if you want additional maps and premium content, if so then yes, more money please.  Apparently nothing is free with Blizzard when they believe they can charge you for it.

Incomplete
No chat channels, no private lobbies, no cross region play, poor custom game options, and plenty of glitches such as revalidating the same game copy over and over and over and over... ugh!

Lack of offline playing
Apparently Blizzard in their socialistic approach to control everything about their games forces you to play only online.  Yes, that means no LAN.  And if you were excited to play while traveling without internet connection, forget it, the great Blizzard of Oz has spoken! as you must play via internet.  Big Brother anyone?

I'm no expert but...
Clearly Blizzard has been ruined by their own successes and corporate greediness.  I hope there is at least one decent person within Blizzard who is now saying I told you so.  So, on behalf of all fans everywhere, I would like to formally thank Blizzard for charging us $60 for a partial game that will never technically be ours.",0.01963086227834175

The game was fun, fast and you could not put the controller down. FIFA 15 slowed things down and FIFA 16 has completely put the brakes on and made passing near impossible. The match involves the ball ping ponging around the pitch, as if 10 year old are playing with no control whatsoever. Passes are impossible to string together for a prolonged period of time and when you get a break the players run like they have cement blocks on their feet. The off the ball dribbling was a good idea but other than that the game is pure trash. Do not recommend getting this and stick to older FIFAs.",0.04354200167872278
1852,2.0,"Civilization III was one of my favorite all-time games and I am an avid city/world builder type games. However, I feel Civilization IV is most definitely not an improvement overall. In other words the sum of the parts does not equal the whole. I have had the game for only a few days and have basically decided that I have wasted $50. I was under the impression that this game was awesome (according to ign.com and many reviews). They rated it at a 9.4 out of 10. I don't know how they came up with that but I'll tell you what I think it should be rated at the end of the review.

First off, I will state the good things about Civilization IV. The graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version. Recommended units for cities to build are given in the itenerary for each city. You are allowed a great deal of freedom in choosing how you want the Earth to appear--climates, land type, world size, how much water, etc. In general the cities are complex, you have the growth rate of the city, the culture of the city and its resources. Also, the game camera allows you to zoom in and out variably, instead of just three levels of zoom.

Now for the things you really must know about the game before you buy it. Far and away this is the worst game I have played yet in terms of hardware requirements. Granted I have a laptop, but my hardware is:
 1.6 GHZ Gen II centrino
 512 Mb of DDR RAM
 40 GB hard drive
 2GB of virtual memory
 128 Mb ATI Mobility Grpahics card running on dedicated memory!
I say requirements because I mean you need much more than the minimum to even run the game without falling asleep waiting for anything to happen. I pressed alt+tab one time and it took well over 5 minutes to get the game back up again. It runs painfully slow and the thing that bothers me so much is why I could possibly need hardware better than mine just to get the game to run smoothly. Someone else had a review on here that had a more powerful system thatn mine and the game had crashed on him multiple times. I play Guild Wars and it doesn't need near as much memory as this game does.

I feel I must edit my review in light of a recent review. The following words were written by Adam Folkerts:

""First off this game is great. It sucks you in and you lose track of time playing. the graphics are good, the gameplay is smooth, the AI is very well done. this is a definate buy game if you like the civ series or simulations in general.

For previous reviewers who have issues with this game, I have had none. I do have a high end machine but you have to with the newer games out now. I wouldn't think about having an enjoyable game experience with a computer that is over 2 years old.

I would reccomend atleast 1GB of ram, a newer generation video card, something past the ATI radeon 9800pro or nvidia FX5950. also you'll need a decent cpu. you'll need a higher end athlon XP in the 3000+ range or higher for AMD, I would say a newer 64 bit cpu if you want to really run this game right. Since I don't use pentium chips I can't say what will run this smooth.

It's true the minium on packages are sometimes misleading but if you plan on buying the newest games you have to be using hardware that was made in the last 2 years generally if you don't want issues. My system is an A64 3500+, 2GB pc3200, an nvidia 6800GT and I had no issues and no slow downs. Get the latest drivers, they are always improving code to make things faster and fix bugs.

If you have a decent computer and want the game go ahead and pick it up. If you are using hardware made 2years or more ago get the game and spend some money upgrading your computer, you'll be glad you did.""

Saying that you can't have a high end experience with a two year old computer is accurate, however, Adam if you would have read a few more of the reviews you would have seen that people were running systems just as powerful as you with the game. I myself have a computer that is less than six months old. Secondly if 1GB of RAM was needed, that should have been listed under recommended requirements. Unfortunately they wouldn't have done that because then nobody would have bought it. The system requirements being misleading is an understatement. Apparently we need a $3000+ computer to run Civilization IV. Also, when I buy I game I don't expect to have to download drivers the very day I get it. I'm not a game tester, this is supposed to be a finished product. It sounds like you work for Firaxis or 2K games to me.

The second greatest downfall of Civilization IV is the gameplay. It is un-inspiring. You basically feel like you are just clicking and waiting for something to happen and nothing really does. The game doesnt even get interesting until you reach the end of the 5th millenium. Battles are inconsistent. Sometimes a weaker unit can overtake a stronger one and sometimes they can't. Finally the main reason why I don't think you should purchase this game is the utter lack of creativity. All of the military units are the same. The countries are almost all the same. Battles still occur on a tile-to-tile basis meaning it could literally take you decades to get troops from one side of the country to the other. By the time the 20th century came around I was completely bored with the game. It was years since the inception of Civilization III and this game seems like more of an update than a new game. Aside from the graphics and camera controls, this IS Civlization III. The game is a serious dissapointment to me and I imagine most anyone who has played previous versions of Civlization.

I'm not trying to be a poster child for other games, but I feel I should let people know what I would recommend in this game's place. Rise of Nations is an excellent game which has about the same graphics, but doesn't need 512 mb of memory. You could probably run it on 64 mb. Because of that, you don't have the huge waiting time for everything and it's not turn-based so things happen at a reasonable time in the cities. Moreover, everything is in scale for the most part, no one hundred foot tall people in Rise of Nations. It is also very similar to Civilization IV, but you could probably find it for about $10. Therefore, would I suggest buying Civilization IV. No. I probably wouldn't even buy it a year down the road when it's cheaper. Be smarter than I am and check multiple places for ratings and reviews of games. I lost $50 because of it. Thanks IGN.

1854,2.0,"UPDATE: I had a replacement because I could not update the firmware of the original one. Also, I updated my review to correct errors and reflect my feelings for this mouse after 1 years.

UPDATE: It seems on-board function execution no longer works. Taking off another star.

WHAT I LIKE  + 
+ Premium feel. It feels very expensive. Soft rubbery surface, metal underside, hard plastic buttons that doesn't feel cheap.
+ Premium looks. Looks expensive too. The lighting is very natural, not overpowering. Braided cable.
+ On-Board Memory FOR PROFILE STORAGE ONLY.
+ High button count: 15 buttons, arranged in an ergonomic way (kind of). I disagree that it feels super awkward to use. A couple of buttons are a little harder to reach, but you assign those buttons to the least frequently used functions.
+ Easy to use software, once you start using it.
+ Does not look ""meh"" like the Logitech G600 and Razer Naga. (Subjective)

WHAT I DON'T LIKE   
 Scroll wheel does not tilt. Boo!
 1-key rollover. While a modifier key can be assigned, you have to use the keyboard for the 2nd key.
 On-board memory profile storage only. Execution still relies on Windows.
 Software is buggy. Poor driver too: cannot properly detect the mouse.
 I really wished Corsair put a button at the center-thumb spot of the mouse.
 Fixed DPI count. User is forced to select 3 DPI settings per profile, no more, no less.
 Needs some getting used to and has a learning curve.

What I wish was there:
 Wireless, weight customization, lighting options.
 Selectable scroll-mode (Logitech G700 let's you choose between free-scroll OR ""click""-scroll)

1855,2.0,"This games makes me appreciate how much work goes into making good games like Halo, Killzone, COD, BFBC etc.

The sound is terrible, weapons and explosions sound ok, but then there are other noises and random dialog that is just plain annoying, especially in the African missions, or in the Target bunkers.

The graphics are very, very PS2, which I wouldn't mind if the enemies and the environment were better differentiated, the color pallete really strains the eyes.

Weapons are ok, melee (knife) is not good. Enemies appear out of thin air in certain areas and keep materialising till the waypoint is reached or mission completed. I've killed over 40 militia just standing in one place, squeezing the trigger every few seconds, in other areas they materialise right of walls right in front of you.

You can't aim down sights so you only get headshots when the game decides to give them, so-called skillshots are impossible to execute with consistent precision, but the game penalises you for running & gunning, spraying & praying.

Controls for PS3 are strange too, and unlike just about every other game out there don't have the option to switch, R1/L1 are for grenades and mines, while R2/L2 are for aiming and shooting.

1867,2.0,"(This review was updated on July 10th, 2006)

I've changed my mind about Super Mario World and actually think it deserves 4 stars.  I was just in a bad mood when I originally gave the game a 2-star rating.  It turns out Super Mario World is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early 90's.  It actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy Super Mario World the same way WE did.

I still stand by what I say in the original review: ""The Donkey Kong Country series, for example, came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting IMO, so, if I were you I'd go with one of those games instead of Super Mario World.  For the most part the levels in the DKC series feel different from each other (plus, they feel more creative and memorable).  Unfortunately, many of the levels in Super Mario World are all basically the same and, as a result, I feel exhausted after playing the game for two hours.

To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives.  In the Donkey Kong Country series, you pretty much do the same thing (except bananas instead of coins) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design, which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself ""I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage"".  It's not like that in Super Mario World.""

I still believe that, but I've recently come to change my mind a little and think that, even though most of the levels in Super Mario World feel the same, that's not necessarily a BAD thing.  I also don't think the graphics in SMW are as nice as many reviewers think.  They sort of look blocky but, to their credit, Nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors, which is a plus.

So go ahead and buy Super Mario World if you want to experience the joy of old-school Mario (the games MY generation grew up with).  After all, it's Mario and Mario games always have something decent going for them (except Mario Is Missing, but with time we've come to realize that game never even existed!)

Super Mario World is basically Super Mario Bros. 3 (but without all the cool Mario suits and less creative worlds).  I like in Super Mario Bros. 3 how you have water, desert, air, plant and ice worlds (in addition to more).  In Super Mario World you just have UNUSUAL worlds such as Chocolate Island and Forest of Illusion.  Those aren't as neat as the worlds in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Super Mario World should have been the best Mario game yet but Nintendo took a few steps back (but with a MONSTER like Super Mario Bros. 3 I guess it would have been difficult to make a better Mario game right after it).

Another problem in Super Mario World is that if you want to get a perfect score (96) you not only have to reach the goal in every single level, but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels (but not all levels have keys).  This means you have to go through many levels a SECOND time.  It's sort of boring.  Once is enough.  The concept of collecting keys wasn't a good one.  I guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape, you can quickly fly through the levels (except for water levels, and any level where the screen pushes you to the right) but that's not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal (or the key).  However, at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way.  I just get tired of it.

Stunning visuals in the movie sequences but the game play/battle action is unquestionably the greatest failure of any game I have played. You have very limited control over your third-person characters battle moves, and most frustratingly, it halts the flow of the game every time you face an enemy. You move through the landscape until you face an enemy and a few seconds pass as the fighting sequence loads up. A failed experiment at an attempt to create a new way to play. A horrible failure.

Still, if you are already au fait with this kind of gameplay, then it may be just fine for you. If you prefer a fast moving or at least fluent experience this will certainly disappoint.

Initially, I was excited to get an Nvidia product to stream games from my already powerful PC rig which runs on a GTX 980 Ti ($700+ GPU). According to GeForce Experience and Nvidia's customer service, I've got more than enough horsepower to stream games from my PC to the Shield. Wow, that couldn't be far from the truth. The 'GRID' service is great, however, it is only free for a LIMITED time. This reeks of Xbox Live and Playstation Network subscription fees (and it will eventually be a paid subscription model with 'tiers'). As if dropping $200+ on this streamer to work side by side with a PC armed with an Nvidia GPU that's about $700 wasn't enough! Sure Nvidia, take more of my money. Playing games on the GRID reminded me of Xbox 360 graphics quality. A lot of jaggies but an average of 60fps, which is good. The really frustrating part is the actual advertising that you can STREAM games from your existing PC. You would think that this shouldn't be a big deal, but it is. Right now, peruse Nvidia's forums and you will see a ton of people venting their frustrations on why the Nvidia Shield keeps stating their PC is 'offline'. Worst yet, Nvidia's ads say you can play games ""on the go"". It's a lot trickier than that. Nvidia's customer service stated that I should download an older version of GeForce Experience BETA to simply stream anything from my PC. Once you actually get your Shield to stream PC games from your own computer..... latency and lag start becoming more obvious (and this was at my HOME network!). My home network has over 150+ Mbps down and 20Mbps up. The only way I got this to actually work acceptably for streaming stuff from my PC to the Shield was to connect the Shield via Ethernet to the router..... which is literally a few feet from my computer! So much for streaming remotely or for running this thing in another location in my house. Look, if you're looking for a media streamer only, there are cheaper alternatives. Apple and Roku will beat this unit and it's so-so Android TV features easily. But if you're looking to stream games from your PC all be it via your Home network or dare you even try to do it outside of your Home network, you're in for some challenges and frustrations.",0.015287716807758707

That is the graphical showcase of this game.  Don't buy this game if you are expecting astounding art direction and hand drawn and painted textures like you would get in The Last of Us.  I can't help but compare The Last of Us to this garbage because that was the last console game that I enjoyed.

1905,2.0,"This game could have been better, way better, then San Andreas, sadly, due to Microsoft's extreme cheapness (as usual) they only included a DVD ROM drive in their Xbox 360 console, and without a Blu-Ray drive, 360 games are severely crippled. This game is so crippled it's not even funny. They've removed almost everything that made San Andreas great. You want a tank? Nope, no tanks. Wanna fly around? Yea, you can do that, on your choice of two (YES TWO, in the ENTIRE game) helicopters. No planes, no fun items, no properties to purchase, no land to take over, no customization of any sort (tattoos, clothes, hair, etc), no building up stats, no deserts, no jet packs, far far less weapons (I believe there is a total of 12 in THE ENTIRE GAME), less vehicles, less places to go into, less things to do, a very short storyline (I completed it in exactly one week, it took me about 2 years to finish San Andreas), and far more disappointments await you. Pretty much, game developers have two choices when developing for the 360, a good game with bad graphics or a game with good graphics and horrible gameplay, RockStar chose the latter. I am not trying to be a fanboy, I own a PS3 and there are many things I don't like about it (particularly the restrictions on sub accounts) but when it comes to a good high definition game, the PS3 is the only way to go. You cannot put an HD game on a DVD, just like you cant put an HD movie on a DVD, it's time developers stop limiting themselves because of the 360. RockStar screwed up because the PS3 version is just a port of the 360 version. Perhaps next time they'll wise up and develop GTA V exclusively for the PS3, or perhaps Microsoft will wise up and release a freakin' Blu-Ray drive add on and stop pretending Blu-Ray isn't the future.

1912,2.0,"Let's be honest. It really is a suitcase with a good led screen built in. I don't remember if it is led or lcd or some combination. I do know that the picture is hard to set up to get accurate color from PS3 games. The color does not have enough settings for my taste and everything seemed to be too bright or too dark. I had to adjust in game brightness and television brightness. It would be great if they send some sort of color and adjustment set up wizard disc. Wouldn't it?

The remote control is almost a joke. I am seriously glad to have it, but it has to have direct line of sight, so you have to aim over the console sitting in the box and the buttons are just furiously unresponsive. Come on bluetooth remote? Anyhow.

Overall, it is nice to have your own screen to play your games on. My Vizio Razor is so much more colorful and vibrant and has a faster response time than this screen and that 22"" only cost me $100@@. This one is obviously three and a half times that cost. But this was in a hard suitcase... Really.

Getting back on to subject. The response time does seem to lag a little bit. Even for a smaller screen the lag is still visible. I think they really should have put a little more money in to the quality of monitor purchased for this, considering the cost to the consumer and also considering the type of consumer who is wiling to lay this much money down for a game screen in a suitcase may be a bit picky about what kind of screen it is.

So yes. I really do think this is more of a complaint than a promotion on what I think about the case. The case itself is great and durable, but at the end of the day, I was more or less paying for the screen with the case as a sweet bonus for me.

I put both my Xbox360 Slim and two types of PS3 slims into this case. The new PS3 Super Slim does not work well with this case due to needing to unstrap and restrap the velcro multiple times while playing to get discs in and out. I recommend the older slim just for that reason(even at the cost of the extra weight).

So, if you have the extra cash and you can't get an LCD of your own to play on wherever your intended destination is maybe buy it.
Otherwise, pass.

The screen is not worth the cost in a whole. The remote lacks response. They should have thrown the PGE Battle Bag in for FREE for this price. I would wait for the price to go down. Or get a Super Slim LED and slip it into a bag with a towel around it ! : )'

1913,2.0,"I must admit, I had high hopes for this game based on the reviews here on Amazon. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the hype.

As you may have read this is more of an interactive movie than a game. Kind of like what Dragon's Lair introduced way back in 1983. Maybe that's why I found the 2nd & 3rd reviews so laughable. This concept is certainly not new, and absolutely not redefining. If this is where games are going, you might want to look for a new hobby.

What makes it different than past interactive-movie types of games, is that the story continues, even if you pick the bad choice. There's no game-over until the whole story is finished, supposedly, even if all the main characters die. However, there is so much slow and boring activity in Heavy Rain, that going through a second replay would be excruciating. A lot of this slow stuff is not only mundane as others have pointed out, but it's inconsequential to anything else in the game. Which basically makes a lot of it a time-sink. There's not much motivation for a replay anyway since the ""whodunnit?"" riddle doesn't change, it just unfolds differently. Some of the action sequences are pretty intense the first time you go through it, but I can't see them having the same impact the 2nd time through.

The big thing here is the story. That's the big draw, right? The truth is, if this were a movie, it would be a 2-star straight-to-video b-movie. There are a number of plot-holes here and there is no excuse for it. Some of them are red-herrings introduced that never get explained, but there are other things that just don't make any sense. Considering that this was supposed to be a dark, gritty and realistic drama, I was severely disappointed. Instead what you have is a 3rd rate, amateur detective story. The reviewers trying to make excuses for this bad writing are complicit in promoting this garbage and lowering our standards. I normally am willing to let the storyline on a video game slide, but since this is hardly a game, it has to be held to the same standard as movies and suspense novels.",-0.0330472733965381

1916,2.0,"TLDR: The ear pads are glued on and not replaceable with aftermarket pads. I found this out the hard way. I could actually see the lining and the glue seams inside my right ear pad when it came unglued after using for a few hours. Pretty disgusting to charge folks 300+ for something that has glue and plastic. Sound was great, the parts surrounding these cans not so much.

Initially, I got this headset and within 3 days I wanted to return it because of the odd way the pass through works with wireless chat on xb1. Now I have changed my mind because I can use it for wireless 7.1 simulated DTS sound, but not chat. I changed my review to 4 stars because of this caveat. The headset does clamp down somewhat, but noise cancellation and great earpads are help that negative portion. Also, the material is loosening up after a few weeks of break-in time.

First, the look of the headset is definitely in that high end category, it's made to last. The second major thing is sound and of course the sound is incredible. I have other headsets like the g930, hyper X cloud II, px4, Sony golds, and 420x for comparison. This one has much better surround sound with the 7.1 DTS by far and of course the Bluetooth capability to listen to music or take a phone call AND hear game sound at the same time is awesome imo. The sound is also crystal clear with balance throughout the sound field. Also the bass is pretty darn good as well. The presets are many and are customizable via apps or pc downloads. There are over 16 presets set as default with the ability to customize to your liking.

The saving grace of swallowing a 300 dollar price tag is I found a way to make this headset work for my xb1, ps4, ps3, and Xbox 360 after a week and a half of finding the right toslink splitter. A toslink matrix is needed to pull this off. If anyone is interested in that, please leave a comment on this review. Needless to say I have wireless game sound on all 4 consoles and wireless chat on the xb1. I have not tested if I can use wired chat with the ps3 or ps4, but generally sound is the same on XB1 with optical out. The sound was so good that if I couldn't use the optical out then I was definitely not interested in a 300 dollar DTS headset only for one console. My main issue was that I wanted to play MGSV on PS4 and Fallout4 on XB1 and have great sound with some versatility. Having the charging base as an active pass-through into a matrix solved that for me and I love this headset now. Being able to use an android app to control everything is also pretty nifty as well, which is also the only way to adjust the mic monitoring ratio.

Now for a few negative issues I don't like, but for the sound quality I'm gonna live with.
-battery life with noise cancellation active is lower than anticipated, less than 10 hours.
-cannot use chat features on other consoles, but can get DTS 7.1 on PS4, X360, and PS3 once passed through a toslink matrix.
-headset can hurt your ears after a few hours until broken in fully.
-will need a tablet or smartphone w/bluetooth to fully adjust mic monitoring because of the supported Bluetooth app that Turtle Beach has.
-some people may not go for the hidden mics because they are not as good as boom mics, but I was told that over my xb live parties that I sounded fine. Update this headset with the latest firmware from day one to avoid any issues.
-the price is hard to swallow, no questions about that.
-volume levels for some people may not go high enough. I factored this into the fact that it can go uncomfortable depending on the presets, games, or apps being used. For my usage it is very adequate.

Finally, I do think for all the features, great DTS sound, and presets that this is worth the asking price, at least once I got the pass-through working. There are other options available, but this thing has superior sound over pretty much anything I have used up to this point.
EDIT 09/10/2015 rating down to 2 stars...
I had to file a return on these due to the right ear pad coming unglued. Yes, I said unglued because you are stuck with those ear pads on the elite 800 and 800x. Its a shame because I wanted to put some HM5 replacement pads on these. This was my last run at a Turtle Beach product. Throwing down 300 dollars plus for glued ear pads is not for me. For 300 bucks, go grab a Astro Mixamp Pro and Sennheiser G4me Ones or Zeroes.",0.02062186191703401

This clearly isn't one.  When I tried it out, I wasn't impressed.  It was boring.  The limited cities.  Only encounting other players IN cities.  No feel for real growth in my character.  No real endgame or set purpose in leveling.  Again, this may be good for a quick log on and play but I wasn't even remotedly impressed overall.

Now the graphics are really nice but unless you are seeking a arcade type game.  So Id have to say, all the other reviewers are blowing this up more than it is.  I found it not fun and rather boring.",-0.00016075256013336076

That playthrough called into question everything that is wrong with this game, and I don't recommend Beyond Earth in the slightest at this point.

It really was a good attempt.  There are varied and interesting map enhancements, and the unique units are interesting enough (but do not have enough unique abilities to make the anything other than better units), and obviously the setting is something that is not done well enough.

1930,2.0,"More of an attempt to create a Leisure Suit Larry Xtreme Party Games title, rather then a continuance of the classic adventure series, Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude will disappoint a majority of it's long time fans. It was a wise move not to make the game about Larry Laffer, but his nephew born from market research, Larry Lovage. Instead of talking to women, working out puzzles and trying to persuade them to spend some quality time with you, here you have a number of arcade games to complete to pass the game. It's the most laziest game design I'd ever seen, my heart sank when a majority of the puzzles required you to play Pong or take photos. The comedy in the game is okay, but it does wear out its welcome when most of the jokes rely on swearing and the fact they've all been done before to better effect in previous titles. Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude also has little replay value compared to its predecessors. A game like Larry 7: Love For Sail had heaps of secrets programmed into it that kept the gamers busy for months playing with shortcut keys and program files. In MCL, all you have to do after you finish is keep playing annoying arcade games until you can afford to make everyone nude.

There's almost nothing here for the long time fans except slight nudity and a few cheap references to the previous titles. Although it should be noted, Sierra tried to win the old time fans over by saying the series creator, Al Lowe, would participate in the creation of this title as a creative consultant. However, months went by with Lowe not receiving any word from the developers. People had grown impatient and evidently gave up hope on Sierra making an effort to contact Larry's creator. However, just before the release of the game, Lowe recieved an e-mail from the developers. It turned out the only involvement they intended for Al Lowe was to make him sign a waver that wouldn't allow him to criticise the game when it came out. Lowe humbly refused their offer.

The bottom line is any Leisure Suit Larry title where Larry dosen't even wear a leisure suit is just going be trying too hard to be hip.

If you're just after a little computer nudity, can't you find cheap Hentai instead?

1931,2.0,"Boring. Derivative. Unengaging. Problematic. These are the words that describe Assassin's Creed Unity. After trying to play this game for a few hours, I've given up. All of the same control problems present in the past titles are still here. Worse, though, is that the story starts out in the middle. It doesn't give you an intro of who you are or what you're doing. It just throws you right into the game without so much as a 'howdy'. For people who've played the past games, that's probably okay. But, even still, it doesn't make the story any better. Unfortunately, all of the opening sequences are about the death of someone in a tragic way watching from the perspective of a relative or similar.

While I realize this is a game about assassins, we really don't need to see the emotional suffering of the family members first hand in the story. I felt that the opening was just far too depressing to really make this title a winner. I preferred the earlier games where the stories were about bad people and you had no remorse about killing them. When you're watching some kid's father die at the hands of an assassin, then that's really too close for comfort and too depressing of a way to start off a story.  It wasn't just one of these stories like this in the opening. In fact, there are at least three different stories that depressing that open this game.

Overall, as I just said, the story starts out too depressing. The graphics are last gen quality even on a next gen console like the PS4. The gameplay is average. The game is buggy. Though, all of this is not terribly unexpected. After the Desmond story line ended, Ubisoft has been scrambling to find a good story for these newer installments. So far, it's not so much in Unity. The whole franchise needs a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately, you won't find that in Unity.

With that said, if you go into Unity not really looking for a great story and only looking for the same play style as every other Assassin's Creed title, you might like this one (if you can get past the bugs). With this one, I'd definitely recommend renting.",-0.08203950037296483

The batteries themselves work fine with constant use. Eventually, they won't hold a charge as well and sooner or later will no longer hold a charge. In the 3 years I've had my Xbox 360, I've gone through 3 of these batteries. The first one took about a year a half to die. The second one (for an additional controller I had) took about the same time. The third one I bought died in about 9 months since I purchased it. What gives?

They refuse to hold a charge! The play and charge kit, as well as the quick charge kit, will immediately note that the batteries are fully charged when you plug them in. They obviously are not.

After receiving countless emails from ZOS about how they're changing the game, overhauling everything to do with endgame, making it more accessible to everyone, they left in the Veteran Rank system for the console launch, the ONE THING that caused the mass exodus of PC players. Once you hit the cap of lvl 50, you'll be asked to do everything you just did, twice over, in the two other faction zones. That's hundreds of hours of questing, and that's the FASTEST way to get to Veteran Rank 14. I seriously can't explain adequately just how terrible the VR system is, all I can tell you is that it's the number 1 reason this game bombed as hard as it did on PC, the number 2 reason so many players dropped the game entirely (no. 1 being the launch bugs), and it's the number 1 reason why they dropped the subscription fee.

Expect a fun albeit somewhat generic adventure to level 50, followed by 300 hours of pointless grinding before you can do any endgame content. Enjoy getting dominated in PVP and turned down for group content in PVE by people who DID do the 300+ hour content grind.

1939,2.0,"This game was very disappointing.  At first, it sounded very promising and different.  You're Keith and you're stranded on an island after the cruise ship you were on has sunken.  Now you have to stay alive using your ""survival skills"".  There's also another person on the island, Skye, that Keith meets up with who was also on the same ship.  However, she is so dimwitted, whiny and completely useless that she makes you want to kill her just to eat her.  It's bad enough to hear Keith whine and complain every few seconds.  Eh, but killing her, unfortunately, is not an option.  Afterall, she's a major part of the story line blah blah blah.  After you've been formally introduced, Keith ""accidently"" steps on her glasses and renders her completely blind apparently because she's completely incapable of moving around on her own.  You than turn into her seeing eye dog and have to hold her hand constantly to move her around, otherwise, she'll stay in one spot.  This will slow down the journey considerably.  Along the way, you'll have to pick up scarcely scattered coconuts, clams, potatoes, mushrooms etc. to eat and drink as well as sticks and twigs to build fires.  But as you venture on, you lose health due to running just as fast as you can feed him.  Before you know it, you've already died 50 times.  This is pretty frustrating especially when he can't run when his health is low and you can't get food and water to him fast enough.  This pretty much comprises much of the game's objective, to keep the bastard alive.  In other words...boring.  You'll constantly have to feed Keith and take time to let his lazy ass rest every 5 minutes.  His little buddy Skye is not any better and you'll have to do the same for her.  Did I mention there's endless walking and climbing through what looks like the same patch of dead grass over and over again?

As somebody who grew up with the cheesy 80's cartoon show, had boxes of the action figures, and owned just about any Turtles game he could get his hands on I was elated when the Turltes got a new series several years ago.  I bought the games for that, which were pretty darned good.  Probably the only one I missed was Mutant Melee.  I even picked up the fairly decent TMNT movie based game for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PC/dp/B000MRAZ3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PC</a>&nbsp;and for the Gameboy Advance.  I have a Michelangelo figure from a Happy Meal sitting on my desk right now.  I AM A FAN!

Now take 25 years worth of material, dozens of characters from the series, a beautiful promo video, and a developer that has made some truly incredible games in the past and...it's mostly squandered.  Playing the game for just a few minutes will leave you saying ""This is it?""  In story mode, you have the four turtles, Casey Jones, April O'Neil, and Splinter.  That's it.  Splinter is hosting a tournament to see which of them is the strongest.  You don't even fight everybody before you're suddenly declared the winner, but the Fugitoid has been captured by Shredder so you'll have to go fight the foot.  It literally took me 15 minutes to beat the game on my first try.  You get a short unique ending for each of the characters.  They didn't bother to change video in the middle, so if you're playing as Splinter you still congratulate the Turtles on winning.

Characters all pretty much fight the same with minor differences.  It's mostly just mashing the weak or strong attack button, throwing, blocking, and using power-ups.  I think the game is mostly designed as a party game for a group of people who may not be able/willing to learn complex fighter controls; if you have 4 people willing to play and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PlayStation-2-Multitap/dp/B00066LGEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PlayStation 2 Multitap</a>&nbsp;you could probably have a lot of fun with it.  I do hear it's got some glitches occasionally marking the wrong player as the winner, but if you're playing with friends who cares?

You can unlock the characters to use in VS battles (Shredder, Karai, Foot Soldier, a Utrom, and Raph as Nightwatcher), though not in the story mode.  If you're expecting tons of characters from either of the cartoons, you'll be disappointed.  No Bebop.  No Rocksteady.  No Rat King.  No Rock soldiers, Foot-tech ninjas, or giant mousers.  Not even a Triceraton makes an appearance.  It's truly inexplicable why they left out so many possible choices.  With simplified controls and no custom backgrounds for them it's not like they didn't have room on the disk to include a lot more.  I'd have rated this game MUCH higher if only for another five characters and a few more battlegrounds.

In the Wii version you can unlock Fugitoid (anybody care?) and three Rabbids from the Rayman series (for some reason?) and a really cool Technodrome stage. Nobody's review tells you this, but that was all cut in the PS2 version!  I've tried the codes, unlocked all the missions, and you don't get any more than 12 total characters.  The Ubisoft website still highlights slots for 20 characters, but even the Wii version only has 16.  I know I'll never pre-order any Ubisoft stuff again.

Battlegrounds are well designed and many have hazards to use and avoid.  For example some levels you can toss enemies off the roof to their death, while others have breakable objects or floors.  There are even a couple like the train level where you have to keep progressing forward as the screen moves or you can fall off and die.  The levels are well designed.  The only one I didn't like was an especially flashy level with explosions going off which made it kind of hard to see my character to continue the fight.

To sum things up, if this is meant as a party game for you and some friends then it'd be a great rental that you could have hours of fun with.  If you're getting this to play a true Ninja Turtles fighting game, it's probably one to skip.  From the lack of content, the limited number of unlockables, and the comic book style animation (which just happens to be much cheaper to animate...) it just doesn't feel like any real effort went into creating this thing.

1945,2.0,"I heard a lot of good things about this game and I've played similar games in this genre before.
My favorite has to be Nocturne from 1999 (if you like horror/creepy games be sure to dig up a copy of it).

With Alan Wake however I just couldn't get into it and here's why:

1) Camera and controls. It's obviously a console port and suffers from the typical ""consolitis"" of not being  properly tweaked for the PC platform.
The camera is hard to control, the FOV is small and it doesn't let you zoom out very far.
It feels more automatic then it is user controlled.

2) The game flow it's obviously story driven. It's controlled, you are supposed to go from sequence 'A' to 'B', to 'C' and so on.  This is not so much a bad thing it it's self but I felt a bit like I was playing ""connect the dots"" too much.

3) And overall from what I saw of it the story feels pretty pretentious.
At the opening there is a Stephen King quote which is right as it sets the tone for the game.
But apparently the designers/writer(s) of this game imagine they are comparable to King.
Things are delivered to you in this way as if you are supposed to be majorly impressed by events as they are rolled out rather then just letting them happen and the player eliciting their own reaction.

4) Finally the real problem I have with this game is this whole darkness thing.
Understood it's supposed to set the ""dark and scary"" atmosphere but it's so dark it leads to a strain just to play, move around, and get a sense of where you are.

Towards the start of the game I needed to get to a power generator inside of a shack to power the lights on.
I had to slide along the walls spamming the action key 'E' to finally brute force it's door's activation point as it wasn't at all visible.
Then a few times falling to my death off the sides of cliffs that I couldn't even see.
There is no map, just some kind of confusing directional indicator.
You do get a flash light past a certain point but since it's part of the game's combat mechanics you can't use it to illuminate your way.

I went to the game settings to make adjustments only to find according to the game calibration screen that my monitor settings were already too bright!

If I really want that this kind of ""fun"" I could do it for free by just walking around the house at night in pitch black to see how many times I can smash my shins and poke my self in the eye.

For a game, this is just too tedious to be fun.
What they could have done as in the case of this generator shack would be just make the door a bit more visible by highlighting or making it glow a little.
Things that you need to interact with are more significant (from the background and fluff), they could be indicated as such visually.

1946,2.0,"At this point in the franchise, I'm expecting total suck from any future WWE releases that continue the ""Smackdown vs Raw"" name.

Since this is basically a slightly improved rehash from last year (and the years before)'s game, I can't criticize it since I've already criticized it in last year's game review of mine.

So I'll point out some improvements and new things:

- Perhaps in response to last year's razor-thin roster, this year has a far greater roster (including love of my life, John Morrison).  Story mode is now actually ""Story"" mode, as it features the perenniel main eventers (John Cena, Triple H, the Undertaker, etcetera) and some IWC favorites (CM Punk, Chris Jericho) and the tagteam of Batista and Rey Mysterio in separate storylines in which you actually have a story that does not repeat itself on an endless loop; each superstar(s) get their own unique storyline, including some twists like in Triple H's campaign where you either re-form DX (for the FIRST TIME in THREE MONTHS) or re-form Evolution (only with Randy Orton on top).

- I can't complain about a lack of ""legends"", as the WWE is releasing a ""Legends"" full game of its own in a few months.

- The CAW creations are far better and far more attractive for wrestler creation; this is the first time in any game since Day of Reckoning (2004) that I've been able to create the most accurate representation CAW of my fictional wrestler ""Bloody Margie"".  Though unlike DOR, she still can't compete in anything except normal matches and tag team matches.

- A big move up for females (or ""divas""); there is a generic ""Career Mode"" which any superstar, male or female, can compete in for ANY title; meaning for the first time in years, a female wrestler can hold a championship belt bigger than the Women's Championship.  Still no luck on competing in the ""heavier"" matches.

Then here come some negatives which need to be addressed:

- Create a Finisher is perhaps a nifty, innovative idea, but much like the entire ""TNA iMPACT!"" video game, it's simply a beta test; You can't really ""create"" finishers so much as just add some extra steps in between pre-existing finishers.  For example, you can choose to stall for 30 seconds before dropping an FU or a Samoan Drop, or you can bounce a superstar on your shoulders so they're facing up or down before dropping them.  There is no innovation, like making a Military Press Slam that transitions into a Hurricanrana and into a dropkick; once you pick a certain move, your next options are extremely limited to only basic transitions.  In totality, it's not even worth making a messy created finisher when the pre-existing ones are so much better.

- Gameplay has not changed one bit since SvR08

And now comes the very crux of this review and of the game.  Everything I said before can/has/will be addressed by others, but this part of the review is my most important aspect that I feel needed to be addressed.

In my opinion, the gameplay is terrible.  In my opinion, this is because there is no collision detection, and no breaking up of moves in progress.

Starting in WWF Wrestlemania X8 for Gamecube, an option was made where any time there are more than two wrestlers in the ring, any wrestler can break up moves by attacking the people involved, or throwing objects at them, or so much as slapping one of them.  This was mostly a beta, carried over into every succeeding Gamecube release, and while it may have annoyed some people when someone would do a ""Giant Swing"" in the middle of the ring and knock EVERYONE ELSE over, it was fun, hilarious, innovative, and much more realistic than punching thin air around superstars when one is suplexing another.

Despite the massive fail that ""TNA iMPACT!"" was, they managed to perfect this collision detection, as moves could not only be broken up, but broken up realistically---that is, if one superstar is about to be suplexed, when you attack the person suplexing him, you will only knock down the other person and not the victim.

WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2008 does not have this.  WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2009 continues not to have this.

It is about time that this franchise begins to include collision detection/move breakups.  Even if it means ripping the idea straight from Midway, I think it's worth the risk if only to add the extra fun factor of it to these games.

More so than with SvR08, the more I played SvR09, the more I wanted to stop it and hook up my Gamecube to play DOR2 again, just because I could break up moves at any time.

If this game had had that, I would have rated this game five stars, and considered it the best wrestling game of the decade thus far.",-0.005114429388557356

Then the game installs, only with internet connection, and yet again, internet connection is needed to run the game the 1st time.

This is not good for those of us using air cards or other wireless services, where we pay by the amount of data.  If you have an internet service that charges by amount of data sent/ received, you seriously need to reconsider prior to purchasing this game.

If you are in the military and serving in Iraq or Afghanistan AVOID this game!  Without an unclassified internet connection, you can not install or play this game.  We all know that trying to connect a personal computer on a government LAN is not good.  It's not like Time Warner or Comcast is available for internet service overseas.

What is frustrating is that you are required to create accounts before playing the game. If you are unable to play the game (in my case insufficient graphics card capability, even after updates) you'll have wasted a lot of time, not to mention the cost of this game.

Had the game loaded with the option to conduct a graphics card and system check prior to installing, it would have prevented the past three hours of frustration, and the need to create the account.

Wish that game developers would offer free program to download and test our systems before we purchase the game.  Would have saved $50+.

Also missing are the uninstall options for the Windows Live, Steam, and DoW2.  Uninstalls have to be performed manually and make sure you check for hidden files and folders too.

DoW Winter Assault is my favorite of the series so far, having purchased up to Dark Crusade.

Had all the small print (graphics card, registration, install process, etc) been fully published in the magazine sneak peaks and game website, would have saved time and money in not purchasing this product.

The Party Mode is horrible too.  The games move extremely slow and the controls are also terrible and unintuitive.  I'd say that Party mode kills the party and just ends up making people frustrated, especially people who don't play Wii that often and don't understand the Wii remote quirks.

1955,2.0,"I bought this at Walmart at the start of September 2014 after I found out they stopped selling the 2 pack of the Microsoft batteries and it was either overpay for 1 single Microsoft battery and yet another cable that I didn't need. I tried this cheaper option instead thinking it would be decent because I have a Nyko Charge Kit for my Wii which has worked wonderfully for 3-4 years. Boy was I wrong....

I kept the charge cable hooked up 8 hours with the Xbox turned on the first day to make sure there was a full charge in the battery (which does not have a very tight fit like people say, it is a tad loose and does not fit as well as the Microsoft batteries do). I unhooked the cable and after just 2 or 3 hours of play, the battery was registering only a 3/4 charge on the Xbox Home menu. The battery ended up making it just shy of 20 hours before it died completely on me. It did this for 3 full charges worth...  only about 20 hours of gameplay for a full charge. The last time I attempted to charge it, after keeping it hooked up for about 10 hours, the next morning when I turned things on to play it showed a 3/4 charge after those 10 hours of being hooked up the day before with nobody playing in between. That has since lasted only 5 or 6 hours before it's showing it's 1/4 full already.

These batteries are a piece of junk and you should not waste your money. As much as I HATE Microsoft, their battery packs, on a full charge, last 35-40 hours for nearly the same price of Nyko.

This went on sale for $30, and I bought it primarily for the campaign. I figured that to some extent even if it isn't very good, you know what you are getting with any COD campaign. You run into a room with a lot of bad guys who hide behind things and shoot at you, you clear the room, you go into the next room, you do the same thing again, and if you are lucky you get to see a lot of explosions and destruction. I figure even a bad COD campaign that sticks to this formula can only be so bad, but I was wrong. This game is really boring. I was actually okay with that. The robots you shoot are some real bullet sponges and killing them isn't very satisfying, but I was prepared for it because I read the reviews. What I wasn't prepared for is the fact that the online campaign and offline do not sync, and when I switch back and forth between them somehow my saved progress keeps getting lost.

It isn't worth the frustration. For starters, the free flow fighting system is off. You can be beating down your enemies and Batman will randomly decide to punch a wall or the air instead of the guy standing right in front of him which, of coarse, ends your combo streak. This happens too often to write it off as a mere mishap. I am not sure what prevented WB Montreal from copying and pasting the codes from the first 2 Arkham games, but they should have found a way because the fighting system in this game doesn't seem to flow as fluently as in the past.

Perhaps my biggest let down is the multiplayer. I was immediately turned off from it when I realized there were trophy requirements in order to obtain platinum (c'mon, really!?). But, what is truly disappointing is the fact that the multiplayer is almost completely broken. You are lucky to even get into a lobby half of the time and when you do you constantly "" lose connection"" or get booted mid-match. On top of this I have had mt screen go completely black while playing online and have also experienced times when I can't shoot or run. These game breaking bugs are hard for me to accept. How can you, WB Montreal, release a game knowing that there are certain aspects of it that just don't work? And then add trophy requirements that many cannot achieve without boosting because the game itself doesn't work right? It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I was psyched when I heard about the development of this game initially, but now I am regretting that I even gave it a shot. The multiplayer is fun when it works. I'll give them that.

Ignore the hilarious amount of padding and plastic that has been wasted on a cheap case for games.  Ignore the shape of the case, which for some reason suggests that it will hold a system above the molded plastic, ala the PDP Custom Crystal Case.  This is ONLY a case for the games.

When I received it in the mail, I thought someone had pulled a prank on me.  Based on the sparse information in the product description, I expected to get a cheapy, no-frills clamshell case for the PlayStation Vita.  After all, none of these pictures shows the Mad Catz Armor GameCase to scale, and the bullet points about the product mention fitting games and memory cards in molded plastic in much the same way that full cases for the Vita do.  Why they bothered to make the case look like a case for the system itself is beyond me.  As is, it's effectively sturdy for holding 6 Vita game cards at a reasonable price, but it's also considerably bulky (it's about half the size of the Vita but thick as game card cases go), a waste of plastic, and the moldings don't release the games as easily as you'd want.

Perhaps I made a boneheaded error, but with the scarcity of information available about this item, I don't feel particularly stupid for making that mistake.

1972,2.0,"WET is an enjoyable third person shooter that gets all of its premises correct but fails in other major areas. I'll start with the things this game gets correct.  Rubi is cool; quick-witted, agile, talented and extremely agitated.  This frustration leads to ruthlesssness; i.e. everybody dies.  There's one mode when Rubi gets upset and is by far the most fun to be had in the game.  The screen goes red, black and white and the enraged Rubi can make quick work of her foes.  There's also a few fun sequences such as jumping car to car in traffic (like the Matrix) and falling out of a plane and those are very well executed.  She moves fairly fluently and the slow motion shooting aspect is both fun and highly functional.  Simply put, it's fun to play as Rubi.....in spurts.

This game is only good in spurts mostly because the story is flat out terrible.  The story is so convoluted, confusing and incoherent that it doesn't drive the story forward.  The only motivation to move forward is to finish the game.  The villains are forgettable, the side characters are more annoying than interesting and no character is developed...not even Rubi.  There's no back story on her as she's pretty much an assassin that lives in the desert.  Her personality nor motivation changes at all throughout the course of the game.  We are thrust right into a shooting arena and the game goes along in that manner for the entire duration.  Rubi doesn't have to learn any of the skills that carry throughout the game.  So pretty much from the jump...you're a bad a$$ and only you can stop yourself.  Rubi Malone seems like a character that can be developed a lot better than presente and some more formidable opponents should have been created.  I mean really....a guy with a gatling is your biggest competition????

The graphics are below standard.  I'm reading that that is the overall style of this type of art style but still the graphics leave much to be desired.  The fire and water look absolutely terrible (especially after playing games like Assassins Creed, Uncharted, Enslaved, Heavenly Sword etc.)  THe buildings are murky and difficult to look at and distinguish from one another, the characters are blocky...and overall the game just looks bad.  Even the cutscenes look bad. It looks like a PS2 game.

The level design is also very weak and the platforming is horrible and probably should have been left out.  The camera fails to swing around so often times you are just jumping on a prayer.  Simply put it isn't fun climbing along walls, jumping from pillar to pillar etc like it is in other games.  It's more like when is this going to be over so I can shoot some people type of experience.  The arena sequences are fun but sometimes, no a lot of times, it's tough to determine how to get to some of the bonuses and swings.  It's also tough to determine where and how many ""doors"" there are to close to complete.  That part was hit or miss....some arenas were a blast while others were just a chore.  And some of the enemies could take 5 minutes of gatling gun to the chest and not die...I felt that was strange....but nothing too deterring.

So i'm a fan.. saying... this just isn't good enough!

The reason?  Even though it translated well to wii they did not include Wifi support/Online Play!  What were they thinking???!  This, above all else, was what I hoped to see most happen to this series.

You cannot have a decent fighting game.. or anything really, revolved around ""Competition"" and not have online play in this era of video games and expect to succeed.

So unless you have friends come over to your house you are left playing against the computer all of the time or just.. like me and most people, letting it collect dust and playing other less-playable, less-enjoyable fighting games that actually DO support online-play.

If they charged 3x the price and offered half the content i would have been happier with an Online version of this.
Major thumbs down.

From this point on i refuse to purchase any other fighting game unless it boasts wifi/online play

Other than that, i have no complaints.  Good for the collectors.. but only for that purpose.

1980,2.0,"I loved the Diner Dash game on the DS and a friend suggested picking up Cake Mania.  I saw this sequel and got it instead.

And was terribly disappointed.

The basis of the game is arcade-like and quite fun.  Customers tell you what they want and you have to recreate your cake confections before they get irritated with waiting and walk off.  You can keep them entertained with a tv or a cookie to help the waiting.  Their orders range from simple cakes to ones that have double layers, different shapes and cake toppers.  Some have said the game is too slow, but you have the option of buying shoes that will speed up your baker.  These can be upgraded more than once until you are almost TOO fast.

The sound effects are simple and quite annoying.  The wacky kids with the inflatable pool duck toys are the worst with their canned ""Hey its my turn!""  Everything else is pretty much easy to ignore, but add little to the game itself.

HOWEVER, Cake Mania 2 has one really crippling problem.  This was originally a PC game and the real estate of the DS screen is nothing compared to what you can get out of a computer monitor.  Instead of doing a back/forth switch screen like Diner Dash does to get over this hurdle, the game tries to shove everything on one screen.  AND FAILS.  TERRIBLY.  Everything requires absolute precision and the touchscreen seems to be a little off as well.  The places to trigger the correct cake shape and frosting colors are tiny so you have to stab the stylus like it was a needle in the exact spot.  Also, the customers request their orders in a ""picture bubble"" and when it gets to double layer cakes with toppings its often hard to tell exactly what they are asking for.  The sprites are so tiny that a round cake with red frosting can look like a heart shape cake with red frosting and vice versa.  Especially when there's a bear or cat topping on the top of it all to obscure even more of the cake you are supposed to be baking up.

Overall, the game is quite alot of fun, although extremely easy.  The only thing that makes it difficult is the touchscreen issues.  The developers must have been aware of this hurdle because it seems to be reflected in the game's difficulty.

Ah and its not that much different from Cake Mania 1 either, which is a superior product in many ways.  It's a shame that this second effort couldn't keep up the fun of the first, it just simply doesn't add enough to spice things up and the frustrating controls suck alot of enjoyment out of it.",-0.08186471624038354

That pretty much sums up my feelings about this game.

I don't usually write reviews, but I felt I had to say my bit on this title.

It is a very pretty game.

I'll give it that, but little else.

DOAX2 = DOAX1 + better graphics + novelty features - in person multiplayer - some reason to play the game

Let's see... we have the new eye candy mini games.

Neato if you love button mashing madness.

We have the new Jet Ski race.

Big yay there.

It's an entertaining diversion, but nothing overly special.

Got old for me quick.

The new casino games are ok.

I spent more time playing in the casino than anything else.

We have ONLINE multiplayer now!

Woo Hoo!

Now you don't have to worry about making real friends and inviting them over!

You can just play with whatever random person is out there on the net.

We have online multiplayer at the expense of the offline two player game.

That pretty much kills the game for me.

One of the biggest components of this game and the previous title is going about gathering all of the bathing suits and other goodies for the various characters in the game.

With the old game, whenever a friend came over to play a two player volley ball match, you could show off the various outfits you had acquired, make inappropriate comments about the ladies, whine about losing because of the control scheme, and enjoy your company in general.

With the DOAX2, there is no offline multiplayer game.  No local two player mode.  I guess the people who made this game figured that the players who would play it didn't get out enough to know any people in person, and those they did know they only talked to over a crackling headset.

Well, that wasn't the case with me and my friends.

Between rounds of Halo and Soul Calibur we'd pop in DOAX1 for a change of pace and everyone liked it.

That was the part of the game I really liked:

The social aspect.

That made me want to collect all the different outfits and items so I could show them off, and hear my buds comment on them. It gave me a reason keep playing the single player mode (which in no way had an elaborate storyline).  And I enjoyed it.  I really did.

DOAX1 was a gem.

And while DOAX2 has a pretty face, there is nothing shining behind the eyes.

All in all, even with the online bit, you are still alone, just playing with yourself.",0.02985326209043355
1984,2.0,"Frankly, I am surprised by the lack of disappointed buyers of this software. This is the second Action Replay I've purchased from Datel (the other being the Action Replay Max for PS2) and this is also the second time I am supremely disappointed.

First, I'll say the good things. This Action Replay is tremendously more friendly than the ARMAX for my PS2. While it is impossible to enter new games and codes on the ARMAX (or hell, even codes for games that are already there), it is very much easy to do so on the GameCube AR. The second is that the interface allows for easy access.

And that's pretty much it. That's all the good things I can say about this package. My first problem with this AR is that there is no easy way to enter codes. If you make a mistake, then you have to use the C-stick to go back, but the damn thing moves ridiculously fast. The other problem is that if you hold A, then the letter you inputted will repeat itself. Why put this in? There is no code to which this would be a useful feature.

Finally, my second and worst gripe is that there is no convenient way to input codes. I am NOT one of those guys who buys a cheating device and is content with the codes already there. I am an avid gamer who looks for the best possible codes, so I am constantly typing codes in. The problem here is that some of the best codes are extremely long. For example, the Resident Evil Inventory Editor code was 32 line long and it nearly killed me to put it in.

Next, the other problem is with the included memory card. It is completely unstable. When I first used the AR, I was so happy that putting cheats in actually worked that I made the horrible mistake of forgetting that I was dealing with Datel. By forgettng this, I had also forgotten to back up all the cheats I created. So what happens? The memory card gets messed up and I had to reformat it, thus losing all my cheats, including the 32 line RE code. I kept in mind what happened and decided to re-input codes for SSB:M (debug codes, of course). What happened? I forgot I was dealing with Datel again. What I was going to do was backup the codes after I was done inputting it. Well, when I was done, I immediately turned off the GameCube and turned it back on with the lid opened so I can backup on two other memory cards. My day was completely ruined when I discovered that the Action Replay memory card needed reformatting again.

Finally, my last gripe is that Datel has the worst code hackers I've ever seen. They have simple codes like infinite health, unlock everything, and stuff like that, but nothing truly special. By special, I mean codes like the Debug code. For those of you who don't know, debug codes allows you to have complete control over a game. For example, in Super Smash Brothers: Melee, you could use a debug code to play six players melee. And here is where the problems lies. You will NEVER see Datel input codes like that. This is why I recommend people to go to other Action Replay code sites, such as GSCentral or Action Replay Central. Don't bother using Datel's website, it is slow and useless.

Overall, Datel is probably content with what it has because it has a complete monopoly over the cheating device market on the GameCube. There is no CodeBreaker here to challenge its dominance. GameCube players are stuck. Datel also released the Action Replay MAX for GameCube (most people don't know this) on their website, but it sucks just as much as this one. The only difference is that it has newer codes.

I honestly wish that Pelican would release their awesome CodeBreaker device on the GameCube, but currently, there is no plans for that. I recommend the Action Replay ONLY because it is an excellent device to bring out the most out in any game, but I also recommend getting the MAX drive with it. The MAX drive will update your cheats quickly. Of course, this product is also made by Datel, so who knows? Not to mention it is also wildly expensive. If you plan on not buying the MAX Drive, then for the sake of your sanity, save your cheats on a regular memory card!",-0.023738229408659682

When I got my headset a little over a year ago, the cable did not work properly.  I had to turn it a certain way to get the mic to work, and if I moved the mic function would cut off.  This seemed to subside after awhile and got better, but now the chat function refuses to work at all unless I push part of the cable in towards the volume control unit.  Basically I need to buy their replacement cable.  IMO this should not be happening after a year.  It's not like these headsets are inexpensive by any means.

The worst thing about Turtle Beach headsets, as many others have noticed, is the BUZZING.  Whenever the mic function does decide to work, there is a constant, annoying buzzing sound in my ear.  It ranges from loud to quiet depending on the day, but it's always irritating.  I thought it was a defect until I read so many complaints about the same thing and realized all of these headsets are like that.

The headphones are bulky and hurt my head after awhile.  This is a minor complaint next to the poor quality talkback cable and the constant, annoying buzzing sound.

I sort of compare these to Beats by Dre - poor quality, but they sell like hot cakes for an expensive price due to their brand name.

As of October 2014, I am completely fed up with this product.  I bought a $14.99 replacement talkback cable, which fixed the problems I mentioned earlier.  That cable had less buzzing also.  Now that cable has also failed (or some other aspect of the unit), and I can no longer hear the game sound through the earphone.  I can hear other players talking, but not the game's sound itself.  So I can either drop another $14.99 on another cable which may or may not work, or just accept that this headset is a POS and stop using it altogether.  What a waste of money.

1998,2.0,"Disney Infinity
Developer: Avalanche Software
Publisher:  Disney Interactive
Genre: Platformer
Release Date: 8/18/2013

I know, it's a bit late to be reviewing a game that came out in August, but my review copy didn't come until Thanksgiving for whatever reason. Now that it's here and I've played through the game entirely, it's time to review it.

The trend of games that interact with figures really started with Skylanders. This physical/digital interface has only taken off since then with two Skylanders sequels and <I>Pokmon Rumble U as a Nintendo Wii U exclusive. Unfortunately, where I am a huge fan of the previous two games, there was very little I found likeable in Disney Infinity.

It's hard to pick a point to start, but I guess the figures are as good as any. These are well made and like Skylanders toys, they are a bit overpriced. Unfortunately the toys are extremely limited in what you can do with them compared to other interactive figure games. For example, with Skylanders, your figures have different abilities, can be used on any level, and as you level them up, you can customize them to a degree and watch their stats and abilities change. You can also use any figure at any time and the game is fine with that. With Disney Interactive, none of that is true. You can only use specific characters with each toy set. So Captain Jack Sparrow can't be used with the Monsters University world and Tonto can't play with Cars. You can interact with the Little Big Planet-esque or Toy Story 3-esque ""Toy Box"" where you design your own world/level, but that still means the figures have every limited use compared to similar games. Even worse, leveling up is Disney Infinity conveys nothing new for the character in question. A Level 1 Mr. Incredible is exactly the same as a Level 13 one.  You earn a star for leveling up though which gives you a shot at a random item to use in Toy Box Mode. That's pretty uninspiring when compared to what all you can do with Skylanders or Pokemon Rumble U figures. Worse yet, because there is no real bonus from purchasing extra figures, owning these unmoving (but well molded) pieces of plastic that are sold separately from the core game actually brings nothing to the table.  Sure Dash will have different attacks from Violet, but The Incredibles world will still play the same and the end boss will be exactly the same to a T regardless of who you use.  I should also point out since I'm reviewing the PS3 version, there are some trophies you can only earn by purchasing extra content  something that you don't have to do with Skylanders. So really, aside from the single three minute or so Adventure that is specifically tied to a figure, Disney Infinity didn't really need to be a figure interactive game because it possesses none of the actual reasons or gimmicky gameplay that makes the figures important to the overall game. If this had just been a collection of three six hour platformers and a world building mode, no one would have known the difference. Instead, it just became a pure cash grab rather than a game where the figures actually matter.

Then there's the game itself. As mentioned <I>Disney Infinity</I> is three platformers where the other figure interactive games are beat 'em up button mashers. So if you are looking for a similar game mechanics and style wise, you won't find that here. I actually approve of the three platformers and the world builder option as that's a lot of content. Most platformers are under ten hours for a full budget release and here you're getting three of them. On paper, that MORE than makes up for how limited the figures are compared to similar style games.  Unfortunately the platformers are pretty buggy. You have to download the patch 1.01 to even make the PS3 version of Disney Infinity playable. Even then, the game is now on patch 1.05 and while Pirates of the Carribean plays exceptionally well and is a lot of fun, both Monsters University and The Incredibles are filled to the brim with bugs. With Monsters University, there are some rendering and anti-alias issues but more importantly, some quests don't trigger correctly or show up on your screen at all> This would be fine if they were optional subquests, but it happens only with the core story progression quests. This means you'll get a ""Go to the clock tower"" command repeated, but the quest won't show up in your list of things to do and the quest that is supposed to occur when you get to the clock tower won't trigger until you go and come back repeatedly. This is exceptionally frustrating to a gamer of any age, but for younger gamers, this will probably make them not ever want to play the game again. The Incredibles is buggy but in a very different way. You have enemy respawns the level of which I haven't seen since Evil Dead: Hail to the King<. You know, that video game that is often listed as one of the worst ever made? You also have collision detection issues and some quest detection issues, but thankfully the quest problems seem to be only with sub or sidequests. The final boss battle is pretty buggy though and your character will sometimes fall to their death even when not hit by anything or an item you chuck at Syndrome will freeze in mid-air and just sit there for a while instead of completing its intended journey. All in all, the game was released way too early and the fact two thirds or the play set are this buggy even after patch 1.05 is pretty inexcusable. Had I reviewed this back in August, I'd probably be even more scathing in my commentary.

So while these two big issues should have you looking at something else for the holiday season, sometimes you or an intended gift recipient will still only really want this and ignore the huge red flags. So if we ignore the bugs, the fact the figures don't actually do anything except get you to spend more money and it's the second rate love child of Skylanders and Little Big Planet, what is there to LIKE about Disney Infinity? Well, it's a chance for a Disney fanatic to get to play video games based on some of their favorite recent charactersand Jack Skellington. He's the most veteran character playable in the game. Love of Disney goes a long way and some of these characters have never had a video game, so this is your first chance to play with or as these characters. Sometimes the love of a licensed brand outweighs even the buggiest games. We've seen it throughout gaming history.

The stories for each platformer are cute too. They are nothing to write home about but they're enjoyable enough to keep you going through the motions. They're generally rehashes of the movies  beat Syndrome's crazy scheme, take down the Kraken and Davy Jones and do frat pranks to another university.  The stories of each game are little more than window dressing to the overall experience, but they tie each Play Set together enough that you'll have fun with what is there and get some overarching plot for the events to boot.

The visuals of the game are also decent. While the level of detail and animation to Disney Infinity isn't at the high end of what you would expect from a modern console, the game looks better than what you'd find on a PS2 or Xbox and are generally in-line with the usual visuals of a mid-tier quality game.  I'm a bit disappointed that the approved screenshots for the game Disney is making review sites use are NOT of the actual quality you'll see in the game. Pity. There aren't a lot of character models in the game (although a lot of skins for the NPC ""toys"" are there) and the graphics aren't as impressive as other Disney games that came out this year like Castle of Illusion, but children and Disney fans will be happy with what's here.

The audio aspects of Disney Infinity are odd. They don't actually use music from the movies, but rather music that sounds like it could be leftovers from the soundtrack. It's a bit odd. They should have been able to use the core music from each movie. I mean, Rise of the Underminer had actual Incredibles music and Lego Pirates of the Caribbean had all the familiar catchy music from the films, so why didn't Disney Infinity?  I have no idea, but it's very perplexing. Likewise, they were unable to get many voice actors to reprise their characters. Jared Butler does Jack Sparrow's voice here instead of Johnny Depp. Likewise Billy Crystal, John Goodman, John C. Reily, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and many others are replaced by (cheaper?) sound-alikes. They do an okay job, but it's obviously not the original actors for each character. That said, some people did come back like Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible, Sarah Silverman and Princess Venellope, Chris Sarandon as Jack Skellington and Mandy Moore as Rapunzel. Hearing the sound bytes from these characters it sounds like their lines were ripped directly from the movie rather than being new recorded material for the game, but I'm going to be optimistic and say it is. After all, why not do that for everyone then? Still, the mix of returning and declining characters in an odd one and like the music, makes the aural bits of Disney Infinity feel somewhat off.

Playing Disney Infinity is also a mixed bag. The general running and jumping of the game is fine. Combat is iffy due to collision detections. Stealth based bits in Monsters University are all over the place. You can be facing a person looking for you and have nothing happen but then be in an area where there is literally nothing but you and shadow and somehow be seen. Piloting boats is a bit awkward due to size, but the driving controls are pretty tight. Piloting a flying vehicle like Dumbo or a helicopter just might be the worst experience I've ever had trying to drive in any video game. The controls are just terribly done and not at all intuitive. Thankfully you rarely ever have to do any of this but when you do, it's profanity inducing. In playing the play sets, you'll find each to be pretty easy but the experience gets bogged down by bugs, bad controls, the occasional freezing up and quest detections. As I said earlier, Pirates plays the best and it pretty good on its own (although the Lego video game with the same license is far superior) and while the other two have their moments, the bad outweighs the good. There is little replay value to either unless you are trophy hunting or trying to get stars to unlock new items for the toy box, and that's a bit disappointing too.

Then of course there is the Toy Box, which has a lot of potential, but that few gamers will actually make use of. Here you design your own levels to play in and to put online for others to download. There are some great free levels available online, like a bunch of Ducktales themed ones, but for the most part, there's a lot of badly designed rushed stuff. It's like RPG Maker, Little Big Planet and other games where you design levels (or CAWS for you WWE fans) for friends and random strangers  most is mediocre to sub-par, but there are some great levels hidden amongst the crud. Some that I'd say are better than the Avalanche designed worlds. Of course, you have to have the desire to make levels to get any use out of the Toy Box  otherwise it sits their unused and unloved unless you are trophy/feat hunting, which kind of flies in the face of the Toy Box to begin with.  I personally didn't care for the Toy Box due to the randomly earning parts (most of which are useless) and felt the ESPN branding of anything sports related was a bit tacky. Other gamers, especially those who fall in love with Disney Infinity will find this a far more rewarding experience and easily the crown jewel of the game. Plus it's the only place where you can have Mater from Cars meet Wreck-It Ralph.  Toy Box Mode is what you make of it but unfortunately most people won't be able to take advantage of it to its full extent and those that try still have to get pieces for their worlds in a random fashion. Ick.

So overall, I'm not sure how this game has done as well as it has or received that many positive reviews. The toys don't really serve a purpose compared to other figure interactive games, the Play Set worlds are one and done affairs and aren't as good as other platformers on the market. Toy Box Mode is limited compared to Little Big Planet, the game is still extremely bug ridden months after release and the both the audio and visual components of the game, while acceptable, are nowhere as good as they could have been. I'm extremely disappointed in Disney Infinity and can honestly say any of the Skylanders games blow this out of the water. Of course, I'm lucky enough to have reviewed the PS3 version> The Wii version is even more limited and the 3DS version is like Mario Party. I know I'm too late to say this to most of you but  save your money; Disney Infinity simply isn't worth it.",-0.00988645673641679
1999,2.0,"This game a foul - the long cut scenes are full of disgusting humor. Those were the best bits. The actual game iteself seemed like cruel and unusual punishment. The 'puzzles' wouldn't stump a four year old and the game play is tedious and repetitive. If I hadn't borrowed the game from a friend I would have put it down the garbage disposal by now.
The game suffers from many of the problems that Nintendo games have. You have long and tedious jumping sequences in which the character will often fail to jump for no apparent reason causing you to have to repeat the sequence from the start over and over ad nauseam. The direction the character moves depends on the camera angle and, as the camera will swing around unpredictable, the character will suddenly start marching off in a totally different direction when you haven't moved the joystick. As much of this 'game' involves walking along narrow paths, this is a real pisser.
I picked up the controller exactly three time with this game and each time I threw it down in disgust 30 minutes later. I guess I'm a slow learner. If they the game out and just left the cut scenes you'd have something I'd probably pay $5 for but at least I'd think I'd gotten value for my money.
The game seems designed to irritate and annoy the player. Don't buy it unless you really enjoy repeating the same boring stuff over and over.",-0.06336200031852206

The progression of the story is pretty dumb too......it makes me wonder how much of a role the bowchowski brothers actually played in the development of this game.

2002,3.0,"Well, my title says it all really.  I've always enjoyed the COD titles that were made by Infinity Ward over the ones made by Treyarch.  Treyarch just sucks and Activision needs to have Infinity Ward make all of the COD games.  I mean, World at War is still ok, but the story isn't that great, the multilayer is nothing like COD4, and like alot of other reviewers posted the weapons sound generic.  Every weapon sounds exactly the same.  COD4 was different.  I could just be listening while my friend was playing and be able to tell him what weapon he was using, now I have to guess every weapon before I get it right, it's that bad.  The story was actually quite short and easy to finish on the hardest mode, although I kind of expect that from most COD games.  I will say that Infinity Ward's COD's usually take longer, but not by much.  The only difference is that their's actually have good stories unlike this.  Also as other reviewers stated, World War 2 is getting really old.  I think it would be an interesting idea to just make a new war perhaps.  You know, it's a game, it doesn't always have to be based on a war that actually happened.  Maybe do a future war from 2020, or just make up some random war if you will.  I did rate this three stars because it actually is still an okay game to me.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a complete and utter waste of money, but it's still COD, and it's still somewhat fun to play while it lasts.  The graphics are quite good as well though I wouldn't compare them to COD4.  I'll be happily waiting for COD6 because I know Infinity Ward will deliver!

Edit:
I forgot to mention the fact that like one other reviewer stated unlike COD4 you only have one choice of where to go in this game.  You follow a path and you can't stray off the path or you'll hit the invisible wall.  That's one thing I really liked about COD4 is that you could go virtually anywhere.  Right when I started this, on the first level, I saw an open door to a house and you could see inside and everything, and if I remember correctly there was even someone inside that I shot, but I couldn't go through the ""invisible wall"" which was quite annoying.  You're also very limited to where you can go and at times it seems like the ""invisible"" walls are closing in on you.  I mean, you practically have a three foot walkway and you can't stray from it.  This was one of the major negatives for me.",0.01994841180019795
2003,3.0,"I have so many mixed emotions on this game. I've been anticipating it since it was first announced, and I bought a Wii U specifically to play this game. I've been a Zelda fan my entire life. Honestly, I'm sad to have to give this 3 stars, but it's honestly the rating I believe it deserves.

The Good:

 - Revolutionary take on the open world. Seriously, I hope other open-world game developers were taking notes from this game, because it has a lot of great ideas. The freedom is absolutely amazing. See that mountain? You can go anywhere on it. Exploration is rewarding because there are secrets to find everywhere. It really feels like you're on an adventure

 - The addition of voice acting. This was really a good move for the series, it gave a lot more personality to the few characters who were voice acted.

 - The weapon/equipment variety. It was really fun finding all sorts of different armor sets, and each weapon had a unique feel to it. It was really quite impressive the variety in the equipment you could find.

 - The crafting. Cooking was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed upgrading my armor.

 - The shrines. It was fun to have mini dungeons all around the map to complete.

The Meh

 - The story - Zelda stories are never usually revolutionary, but this one was particularly bland. The ending was a huge letdown. I'd hoped with the addition of voice acting that the story would be epic, but it ended up being pretty mediocre. The reason it was so mediocre was because there basically wasn't a story. There were no twists and turns, no surprises, and everything turned out about like you could have predicted within the first hour of the game.

 - The characters - For me, Zelda games have had really memorable characters. Sariah, the Happy Mask Salesman, Darunia, Midna, Fi, Groose, Impa, etc. In Breath of the Wild I barely cared about anyone, because hardly anyone had a real personality. They essentially all devolved into single-minded stereotypes, and no one really had much of a character arc at all. Zelda probably has the most personality and arc of anyone, but she still pales in comparison to past Zelda characters. The villian literally has no personality at all, he's just an amorphous blob that is the embodiment of evil. Calamity Ganon pales in comparison to just about any other Ganon incarnation in the series.

- The combat - the combat just felt clunky to me. Typically I feel like Zelda games have great combat, attacks feel fluid and precise. In Breath of the Wild, the attacks mostly feel weighted down and clunky. Overall the combat just didn't feel right.

- The main dungeons. There were only four real dungeons in the game, and they all felt very much the same.

The Bad

 - The user interface, especially in the menus. It took forever to find the food you wanted to eat (even after sorting it), and it was a royal pain to have to manually go find every ingredient in the inventory, put it in your arms, and then dump it in the pot to wait for it to cook. It was slow, and made an otherwise stellar crafting system kinda clunky.

 -  Weapon durability. While I rarely felt like I lacked for weapons, as they were dropping constantly, weapon durability was annoying. Found a weapon you really like? Well, sorry, it'll be broken after a fight or two. Theoretically you can scan the area around you to find another one, but it's honestly much more hassle than it was worth. It felt like I had to save my awesome weapons instead of using them because they break so easily.

- The size of the world. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the game was actually too big. There was too much empty space everywhere. If all you want to do is run around and see pretty sights, that's great. But if you actually want to try and accomplish a sidequest, or get somewhere else specific, it takes forever to get there, even after you've unlocked a bunch of the fast travel spots. It felt like the world was made so huge to pad the game time, because otherwise it would've been the shortest Zelda game yet.

The Ugly

 - The boss fights - Boss fights have long been a favorite part of Zelda for me. However, the boss fights in Breath of the Wild were incredibly disappointing. Only two of the five boss fights in the game felt like they had any semblance of a typical Zelda boss fight - the rest were basically just a matter of charging the boss and beating them to a pulp until they died. No clever mechanics, no interesting challenges to figure out. This was the biggest letdown of the game for me.

 - The music. I have the OSTs of all of the Zelda games on my phone, but I don't feel any need to find the music for Breath of the Wild. This is because there was no memorable music - it was a major letdown to have such bland music in a franchise known for having epic music. Often while you're playing, there really ISN'T any music. It's really disappointing.

 - The performance. Seriously, this was unacceptable. I've come to expect a certain level of quality from Nintendo, and this game just doesn't have it. There are frequent frame rate drops all over the place. It's as if Nintendo is finally admitting that even THEY think the Wii U is underpowered. Seriously disappointing work from Nintendo on this one.

Overall -

This is not a bad game. In fact, it's a very fun game. It's just not up to the quality level I expect from Zelda games, and pales in comparison to previous entries in the series in almost every way. If you're interested in this game, I'd say try it, but if the rest of the Zelda games are at all similar to this one, I probably won't bother to play them.",0.006785732929250354

2012,3.0,"`Yoshi Touch and Go' was developed from a DS technology demo and it hasn't strayed far from its roots. The fact is that YTG is a radical change from any game I've ever played and that's definitely a good thing. Forget any of the buttons; the entire game is controlled using the stylus. Even Yoshi himself is completely autonomous as he inexorably moves forward. The point of the game is to clear a safe path for our diminutive dinosaur protagonist. Players can draw clouds to span gaps, encircle enemies in bubbles and shoot eggs by tapping the screen. If you don't like the clouds you drew you can blow on the DS to blow them away. I won't spoil the surprise on how that is accomplished. The game is fun and frantic as you feverishly draw all over the touch screen. The control feels very good, the graphics are excellent and the designers made good use of both screens. Most of the action takes place on the bottom screen but the top has prizes that can be gathered by spitting eggs at them.

The downside of Touch and Go is the fact that it plays like an unfinished game. The game play is all there is. There is no story. There is no opening. There is no ending and every time you play the game you start over from the beginning. The only goal is the satisfaction of getting a high score and todays gamer may find that that's not enough. One thing that reduces the repetitiveness is the fact that the game seems to have semi-random level designs. If you play the game twice it won't be the same each time. Repetitive game play isn't completely absent from gaming, sports games are designed this way but it's quite unique for a 2D side scroller.

  Rumble of Roses is a average wrestling game although it has some of the best graphics than any other wrestling game to date.  You have pleny of Character choices all with multiple alter ego(ie. Superstar, heel, and babyface).  This is a decently fun game with an easy to understand gameplay, which can get boring after a while but still be fun.

Graphics-5 *****

  The Graphics in this game is totally amazing.  The Ladies of Rumble of Roses practically come to life.  Even though the visuals are for the Mature gamers, not for younger kids.  There are times when the videos get a little choppy but nothing that takes away from it.  This game uses the power of the 360 to its most.  The physics of the wrestlers bodies are well lets say like DOA 4.

Sounds-4 ****

  Sound in this game is also a plus the entrance music for the wrestlers match perfectly.  The voice work are always synchronized with their mouths.  Everything with the crunching of the bones and smack of their fist against the skull is great.  No ring announcers are present which isn't a bad thing as they can repeat themselves a lot.  During the matches the music seems to stop and you are left with a gap before it starts again.

Controls-3 ***

  The control seem confusing at first but you get used to it and it becomes fairly easy to control your wrestler.  Pulling of your moves are easy but it seems that there aren't very many for your character.  All the wrestlers control very differently from the power players to the speedy ones.  Pulling of you Finishing moves are very easy with just pressing the left bumper.  You get quite a few finishers and tag team moves, that are also very easy to pull off.

Gameplay-3.5

  There is no real story mode present at all.  Also don't expect any ladder matches, first blood, casket matches.  But you do have your normal tag matches, 3 way matches, There is also a Steet fight in where you have a life bar in which you lose when you bar hits 0.  An intresting match is the Queens match in which the loser of the match must perfrom some humiliating event ranging from doing the hula hoop to getting squirted with a water pistol.  There is a lot to unlock from new character.  Also trying to unlock wrestlers alter ego's and getting their superstar modes by increasing thier popularity.  I was disapointed that you can't change over the belt in exhibition modes.  Multiplayer with you friends can get a little hectic as focusing on different wrestlers if diffictult.

Personal notes:  If your looking for a great wrestling sim wait till smackdown comes in.  But if your looking for a game with some T&A that has a decent wrestlign engine this is the game for you.  If your looking for a game that will game you panty shots and butt shots close up get this game now!!!",0.02081620725023059

Gameplay : Barely touched. that is all I have to say and now I am going to say this. The skating is the same, shooting + goaltending are the same. The thing that bothers me about the gameplay is that the defense is still as porous as the Pittsburgh Steelers secondary, even on tight D (or a 5 Star in the game) when you change the defense + when you have the best D-men in the game playing for you. It can do more by making it a better gameplaying experience
International Mode: As I said before, this was a decent attempt by the folks at EA to get people to buy a fading product with a possible bleak future. There are 3 leagues from you to choose from. Germany's DEL, Finland's Elitserien, and Sweden's SM-Liiga. But unfortunately, if anyone cared to try it out, this mode was botched, all the leagues are the same except for rosters + playoffs. The mode is nothing more than a glorified NHL 2003 franchise mode. You can even see that when you look at the mode's interface. And most likely you will not know 95% of the players on here. So if you were not a fan of ex-NHL'ers like Greg Adams or Mike Bullard or not from Europe, don't even bother about this mode.
Dynasty Mode- Due to the recent competition from ESPN NHL Hockey + it's worthless Franchise mode, EA has improved this mode. Like for a few examples, There are actually salaries on this game (in $$$, not points) and a good free agency where you don't have to overcome your horrible prestige to get a great player. But it's not that that has me upset about the mode, it's the concept of the mode that has me and most likely others fuming. Here is the concept: The Ebenezer Scrooge-like owners, realizing that they're ""cash-strapped"", take away every luxury item, release every staff member, + sell off every piece of workout equipment to ""break even"". That is where you, the naive GM, comes into play. you trade, sign + draft your way into a dynasty. But all this mode is only about is to please those cheap, Scrooge-like owners, by giving them a surplus in the finances, then they throw GM points around. When you get 100 of them, you have 1 point to spend on your locker room or your staff, + that is what you basically do for 20 years until they shove you out the door + give you a retirement present. Let me give you a hint, don't put it on Legal! even when you have it on level 10, it doesnt work real well. The GM office and the GM ranking are just a sad attempt trying to compete wth ESPN's ""Cribs"" the GM office you just look at, you do not control anything in that room, and The GM rankings are just, well, GM rankings. Trading is much harder to do, no longer can you trade your way from worthless deadweight to perennial scoring champion in no time flat. and that you can no longer sign people + trade them away. The main irk of the dynasty mode is that you cannot change the concept! it is stuck like this forever! and that is why I am somewhat disappointed with this mode.
Sound: It is crisp, sounding like you are watching the real thing in an arena. Unfortunately, that was true in NHL 2003. The commentary is definitely improved, why do I know this, the color commentator from NHL 2003 has been given the boot! the commentary is deeper, more serious than the distraction of last year.
Graphics: They are much better from last years version, unfortunately, the faces have seemed to take a step backward this year (on my computer, that is)

2029,3.0,"This game was...my first ever introduction to Final Fantasy back in the days when the internet started becoming commonplace (circa 2000-2001). I was first introduced to it after playing the great Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time since I was new to the plethora of RPGs out at the time. I have gone back and played this game many times since then. I give it credit for bringing me in but I do not deem it the best Final Fantasy game. Let's start with the pros.

PROS
For PS1 graphics, the character and monster modeling was really good. They everything seem more realistic by having the characters' heights and widths proportional during and outside of battles. The animations during battle had more detail than Final Fantasy 7. For example, looking at a Tonberry from FF7 and comparing it to FF8 I could see more detail and texture in FF8. The Full motion video cut scenes were also really nice to look at. Everything looked smooth and transitions to the normal graphics weren't terrible to watch.

Having the ability to summon your espers (Guardian Forces) during battle an endless amount of times assuming it was still alive, could help during some of the more difficult battles (Con on this aspect mentioned later).

Easy to level up for those who get tired of that aspect and know where to find the right enemies (i.e. Vysage, Lefty, and Righty in that one gorge on the Galbadia Continent).

A vast selection of spells and abilities.

Challenging Sidequest Boss fights (but not impossible)

The music was awesome. There may have been a few tracks here or there could drive one nuts (Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec playing in the sewers at the end of disc 1)

Now let's talk about the Cons. These will outweigh the pros.

CONS

The junction system.
I don't hate on this setup completely because it could employ strategy. There is no MP like in the most other FF games. You draw and stock magic from enemies and warp points to boost your stats, elemental defense, and status defense but you have to watch which spells you use and how often or your stats will suffer. Leveling up doesn't seem to affect your character growth much. For example, junctioning 100 Ultimas to the strength of a level 15 character could produce better results than raising that character's level to 100. Character levels truly come into effect when determining the strength of the monsters since they level as you do. But this can make story line bosses less challenging.

The drawing.
So, you go into a battle against a caterpillar creature and you see spells like Thunder and Cure that you ""need."" Your goal as an RPG player is to make your characters the best they can be. So to do that you stand there and draw the spells that you want/need. But you realize that the more you have the better you'll become. Thus, you will take 1, 2, or all 3 characters available and just draw the limitless amount Thunder and Cure spells to fill up your 100 stock limit. All the while being smacked, or chewed on by this giant bug. It's damage is minor and if you see your HP getting super low just cast a Cure spell on yourself and you are good to go! 10 to 15 minutes later you have 100 stock of each spell for each character... Now let's do that again with a different enemy and for different spells. Oh wait, some characters only draw a few at a time while others draw a larger amount (up to 9) per turn. Gee, their magic skill just sucks! You will spend hours just drawing magic to junction to your stats and never use for fear of weakening your character. Later in the game you will be able to Refine magic from items in vast quantities but even still if an enemy has a spell you don't have access to right there and then (cough meteor cough aura) chances are you will spend the time drawing to have it for ""just in case measures."" I could go on and on with this but this drawing really is nothing but busy work.

The summons:
Yes it's neat to interact with them more often than previous games but that can be a huge detriment. They are best known for helping you learn abilities. The game has an algorithm where you get your money based on the steps you take around the world and it goes up the more monsters you defeat. At the same time it will go down by a set amount if you haven't battled enough and just walk around aimlessly for hours in circles. You have to keep battling to maintain it at the highest salary given. The catch is if a summon defeats the enemies you don't get the credit for it. It has be done by your party members. This makes the summoning less appealing. Granted there will be times you will feel the need to let loose the destructive power of Bahamut or Doomtrain but at later points in the game your characters can become so strong that it would be a waste of time to summon. Plus, your character has a compatibility with each summon and it goes up or down with every summon depending on which spells you cast and other summons you use. Need to use Shiva on a Bomb? Go ahead but every time you do, Ifrit will be harder to summon! Some people will just save them for the boss battles but either your characters will be at a decent stat level after all the drawing or the instant you summon a GF some bosses will go ballistic on the summoner and severely hurt or kill your GF. The abilities are useful and come in a wide range but until you find the right places to get the ability points for each ability faster (Cactuar Island) it will be a long wait before getting Encounter None or Call Shop. How do you even get these summons? Most if not all are optional and minus a few, you just draw them from boss battles. I would have preferred the old ways and actually fought to have them at my side.

The story:
I won't give too much away if there is someone out there who wants to play it for the story and overall experience to make their own conclusions.
The overall idea  about time travel and tragic love stories intertwined are intriguing and it has left some open ended areas for fans to speculate how it all began or why it all ended the way it did. Was it all a dream? Was she the future evil form an alternate timeline? But there are some plot holes that really drove me nuts. If these young adults can summon almighty beings to fight off the evils of the world, why haven't they done so already? Let's sneak in and assassinate a powerful figure with a sniper rifle. Wait, why not just summon Ifrit to throw a giant flaming meteor at her and kill her on the spot? Three discs saved! This could be a complaint with other Final Fantasy games (like 7). The difference here is that you can summon these things in battle multiple times until they, you, or the monsters on the other side are dead. In FF5 and prior you were limited to your MP pool and you could argue that ""with great power come great responsibility"" and that could carry over to realism. In FF6, espers could only be summoned once per battle and with the required MP. In FF7, up to 5 times (ignoring the master materia stuff from sidquests) but still you were limited to your MP pool. It was a basic stratagem of conserving your resources for the right times. This could roll over into the story and play parts into why the characters made the decisions that they did. Where is that conservation in FF8? Ifrit can rain fire down on people so long as he stays alive. It doesn't tax Squall's health, stamina, or magic stock to do so. If there were seemingly realistic limits in place (like using a set amount of fire spells to summon Ifrit each time) maybe I could get behind it more.

And then there's the part where one character appears at the end of the first disc and it takes him a full disc to reveal that he knows who everyone is except for one person, how they grew up together a long time ago, and how the evil they are fighting is someone dear to them from their childhood. WHY WASN'T THIS TOLD WHEN THEY TRIED TO ASSASSINATE THE NOW EVIL PERSON? No justifiable reason is given. The others forgot thanks to the use of the summons and how it affects their memory. This was barely explained at all but even if it that works why would the one person who remembered everything not try to tell them something rather important? If there had been more thought put into this being plausible like he had amnesia and being around everyone stirred up memories, that would at least scrape the barrel. The problem again was that he knew the whole time because he didn't use the GFs...GAHHHH. Noah Antwiler was right.

There are a lot of other things to nitpick about here like how a prominent non-playable character allows you to see the past and tries to change it for the better knowing it is futile and not having their powers ever given an explanation on how they got them or why they got them...but I have droned on long enough.

For me, if you leave out the story, the game play with battling can employ some strategy to a point but by amassing enough money, finding all the right places to level abilities, and go to  the right shops, you can buy and refine rare items to boost stats and abilities to near or at max. As an addition I forgot about the card mod ability that can turn enemies into cards and you can refine items from them (like the morph materia in FF7). So, just for game play and experimenting, it's not a terrible game but it definitely is not the best>

If you leave out the battle system and look at the story alone, it has some serious plot holes and would require fan speculation to fill those in. It has prompted a lot of thought on my part to fill in the voids. But part of that is the beauty of it. Love it or hate it, this game has given a lot fan speculation and theories on who these people are, their backstories, and their future stories. I am ignoring the fanboys and fangirls jumping on the ""Emo-coolness"" of Squall. I can appreciate and understand Squall's motives and like his design and abilities but it's a rehash of Cloud from FF7 only with a more involved love story. Cloud and Tifa shared feelings with each other but it was more of companionship and sibling-""hood."" I don't recall them falling in love with each other to the point of boyfriend and girlfriend. Final Fantasy 8 is not the best game of the series but like I said before it actually brought me into the series so I have to pay it homage. I give it a 6/10.",0.013149942808116596
2030,3.0,"Final Fight is one of my favorite games of all time. When it hit Arcades in 1989 it was an instant classic hit. It came before Double Dragon and Streets of Rage and spawned many clones (a lot from Capcom like Alien vs. Predator and Cadillacs & Dinosaurs), which tried to gain on the success of this awesome game. Some played great like Konami's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, X-Men, and The Simpsons. Some were terrible like Irem's Undercover Cops.
Capcom can be forgiven for this somewhat shoddy port of Final Fight to the Super NES because it was their first game developed for the system and the Super NES was a new system at the time. This port removes the 2 player feature, Guy, the Industrial Stage (Stage 5 I think if I can remember), smaller sprites and the amount of enemies on screen at the same time. Also female thugs Poison and Roxy are turned into transsexual punks Cid and Billy, plus boss Sodom's name is changed to Katana because Nintendo of America is so anal (pun intended! :) ). Otherwise this is a decent side-scrolling beat-em up and one of the best you can find. If you don't mind single player with only Haggar or Cody then you will enjoy. I recommend playing this game on MAME (emulation), going to an Arcade with classic games if you can still find one, playing Final Fight CD for Sega CD, Final Fight One for Game Boy Advance or getting Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox which has an Arcade perfect version of this game and others.

Well if you do then you can expect very similar gameplay in Soul Nomad only with a few more bells and whistles to note.  If you're not familiar with the series then read on.

Unlike other NIS strategy RPGS you don't control single characters in this game exactly.  You build up squadrons of troops and place them in to ""rooms"".  These rooms can contain up to 9 soldiers of your choosing.  Depending on where you place a character in the room (front, middle, back) will determine what attack they will use in battle.  So a single unit is actually made up of several soldiers that execute predetermined attacks based on their location within the room.  You move these units around a map which is comprised of many smaller tiles each of which has a terrain type.  Some terrain is harder to fight on while others give you a special bonus.

As you progress through the game you unlock new troop types and rooms.  By combining different soldier types or having multiple troops of a single type in a room you unlock special attacks and combos.  Different rooms also come with different layouts of available slots and come equipped with decorations that give you various bonuses.  All of the rooms except one come with a standard bonus but there is also a chance when it's created that additional effects will spawn on the room.

The game is fun, initially I thought it was a little hard to bring up new troops but if you have enough money you can buy them leveled up.  Like in other NIS games there's a randomly generated dungeon which is where you do most of your leveling by entering in to a room to ""inspect"" it which will increase the power of the room and yield bonus points for honing your troops.

Unfortunately this game does fail me in many ways...

-It's too simple to unlock all of the characters and rooms (with a couple of exceptions) since all that is required is moving through the game.  There are some greatly challenging optional fights, but I don't really feel compelled to go for them since by the time you have beaten the game everything begins to become ridiculously repetetive.

-There's less than 30 skills in the game many of which only your Hero's room has access to.  Another thing that sucks about the skills is you don't earn them in any way, you simply have to have the proper combination of characters and there you have it, you are then free to spam 3-4 skills for the REST OF THE GAME.

-Unlike the other reviewer I find this game to be far more simplistic than other NIS games.  It's basically a straight up level grind.  There's no need to plan reincarnations or hunt down rare items you simply go through inspection after inspection leveling up and spending points on your characters.

-The sound effects are also highly repetitive and some of them are down right annoying.  You will grow to loath fighting or using wolves since for them to attack they have to howl what seems to be no less than 6 times.  Not even different howls, the same howl over and over again.

It's a pretty decent game but it will probably be a let down for most NIS fans.  If I could go back in time I would either have played this game before all of NIS's other games (minus La Pucelle) or not at all.",0.0003649406006660051
2034,3.0,"It had been awhile since I'd dug into a traditional Final Fantasy type turn-based RPG. The last was FF XII, which was an experience right up there at the top of the scale for video games. Naturally, then, I had high hopes for this ""next-gen"" game from the minds of the FF crew.

I turned out to be a little disappointed, though. Lost Odyssey has none of the polish that made FF XII what it was. Voice acting is surprisingly mediocre, the world is not as fleshed out (although it is still better than most RPGs, a la Final Fantasy), and the combat system is somewhat archaic. Much closer to FF X than FF XII. Why the creators should choose to abandon what was such a winning system is beyond me.

In truth, there is nothing at all next-gen about this game, excepting only graphics. They're very impressive, and beg the player to zoom the camera to take a closer look (which is always rewarded with high-res models).

But there is good to this game. The premise, which pits immortality against mortality, and illustrates the ""blessing"" of mortality (an ability to pursue specific goals and dreams within a finite amount of time - something this current culture kind of needs to hear) is intriguing, and the flagship character's struggle with this is meaningful. The dreams also, while possibly too much for some players, can be touching. This game tries to tug at the heartstrings and makes a theme of human nature, and at its best it does that well, making it powerful enough to remember. Unfortunately it doesn't always do so well, and some aspects are surprisingly unrefined.

This is a game which needed more work, pure and simple. Is it a meaningful piece of work? Definitely. Is it a little disappointing? Yes - unless your gaming standards are not very high. If Final Fantasy XII had not risen to shine over and above this game in almost every aspect, it could rest comfortably with my recommendation. As it is... play it, but adjust your expectations.",0.029718826570182467

2036,3.0,"Blood Omen 2 is an action/RPG for your PS2.  The story is about a vampire, named Kain, who had fallen in battle during an attempted conquest of the world.  After 100 years or so he reawakens to find that his kind is fighting a losing battle.  Your goal is to rediscover your power while fighting to destroy this threat.
 Being a fan of the previous game on PS One, I was looking forward to using Kain in a 3D environment.  The magic system is very straightforward and fighting has also been made uncomplicated.  Add to the fact that the game has a built in tutorial and you have a game anyone can just pick up and play.  For every power you receive you get a situation to instantly use it, allowing you to experiment with usually minimal danger.  Some spells and abilities can be used at any time.  Others have special conditions that need to be achieved first.  This gives the player options to consider at certain parts of the game.  For example there is a mist form that allows you become nearly invisible allowing for a chance to get away or perform a stealth kill.
 What keeps me from giving this game a high ratting is based one major reason, FRAME RATE!  In order to enjoy a game it has to be able to be viewed while playing.  When I first purchased Blood Oman 2, I had a lot of problems with frame rate.  My friends had the same problems.  This is just the product of rushed development or unsatisfactory game testing.  It hurts to see key seems where the voices aren't synched and it takes away from the main game as well.  Some levels are so big that while I was progressing through them the game nearly stopped.  Loading time is also a factor but compared with the heal-dragging frame rate, it's really not an issue.
 Overall the concept of the game is sound.  If you enjoy being a night stalker drinking the blood of innocent and not so innocent victims give this game a good try.  If this not your normal cup-o-tea skip it altogether.",-0.01625075913744878

The HORI Super Mario 3D Land Protector works well with the 3DS, where you can easily protect the system from any damage while playing your favorite games on the go, and looks absolutely amazing with the system. It can also be easily taken off and is expendable. The pouch set though is where the problem is. Where you can store and protect 2 titles, and 1 extra DS or 3DS game if you keep it in the 3DS system, and change it when you need to swap a game for another one.

I rank the best ones as follows: IL-2 (Sturmovik); Janes WWII Fighters; Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator 2 (Pacific Theater); Microsoft's Flight Simulator (WWII Europe Series); and finally this one:  European Air War,by Microprose.

My ranking is based on quality of graphics, smoothness of manuever with a good computer (mine is a 1.8 Ghz Gateway Pentium 4 with a half-gig of RAM and ATI) and the flight modelingof the aircraft (how close to the real aircraft they are in their performance).  My judgment on the latter is based on the fact that I have flown a variety of real prop driven aircraft since I soloed in 1946, as well as many radio-controlled models.

2051,3.0,"This game is fun for the first few levels, but then becomes a very tedious grind once you get past level 20.  Tracks are too few, and not very interesting.  Really need more variety and alot less super twisty tracks.  Turn 10 needed more speedways, and less King Cobra type road courses.

Also don't help that the AI are horrible drivers.  Racing is a game of giving and taking.  I just wish the Forza 2 AI learned when to give ground when they are outbraked into the corner, or just much slower than you are.  The AI also is way too overaggressive to the point they will drive through you at any given time.  This happens alot if you ramp up the difficulty that forces you to break much sooner to stop from locking up your brakes.  The AI also is quite slow in their cornering.  It gets quite irriating wiping out as the AI for some dumb reason brakes on the exit of the corner instead of hitting the gas.

The damage seems a bit unrealistic.  Even on the highest settings it seems more arcade style damage than anything else.  A car shouldn't be competitive enough to go for the win after smoking the wall at 100 mph like the Forza 2 cars do with full damage on.  I don't see the point of having damage if your going to use it more towards a gimmick move to promote sales.  If your going to have racing damage do it right or don't do it at all.  Forza 2 seems to go about half way and stop.

Its nice that they let you do cool stuff to your paint job.  Wish they would have a spray brush option to do some fine tuning instead of doing everything with decals on top of decals.

Overall a good racer if all you have is the Xbox 360.  I'd honestly suggest the GT series over the Forza series.  Not as a fanboy, but from the fact the GT games are more better rounded on all fronts.

But this is one of the issues I have with the game.  All of the dialogue is an attempt at a joke, and since there isn't anyone alive who is funny every time they speak, about 90-95% of the speech in this game is either a lame pun or a lamer non sequitur.  When the jokes hit right, they are quite funny, but these are few and far between.

As far as adventure games go, this game is quite easy, but the puzzles are rather creative.  Wait until you have the ""dream fight"" in Sam's mind.  When the dialogue falters, the goofy game play often picks up the slack.

I like the jazzy music, but each scene has its own music, and since you must return to scenes over and over again, the music becomes repetitive.  The voice acting isn't as good as I was expecting.  Bosco is the funniest, and Sam and Max are tolerable, but the Soda Poppers are whiny little snits.  After the fantastic Grim Fandango, game makers really need to get voice acting in adventure games up to snuff if they want to be taken seriously.

They were poorly-chosen Xmas presents a few months earlier and I wanted to swap them for something more worthy. I only owned said games for 12 weeks though it felt like eternity back then, but something more worthy was about to come.

I traded the games at a trading barrow in Falkirk shopping mall. The games I got in return were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Golden-Axe/dp/B00002SVOJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Golden Axe</a>&nbsp;and Streets of Rage. Upon returning home and jammed in SoR and my mind was blown, first by the funky soundtrack and second by action. Here was a beat-em-up worthy of the arcade that was finally available on home consoles. As a kid, I loved this game. I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. Then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Streets-of-Rage-2/dp/B00002SVO9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Streets of Rage 2</a>&nbsp;came out, and we quickly forgot that this one even existed.

You play as ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam Hunter or Blaze Fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work through in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun, and the screen progression gives the game panel-to-panel comic book vibe.

Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into oblivion. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X, but never mind.

Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the time. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes. Hell, they are ALL standout tunes and classics in their own right.

I am a proud owner of SoR, but when you also own Sor2 it does sort of render this one obsolete. The graphics are a little choppy too, but it is still one of the finer side-scrolling beat-em-ups ever made.

Pros:

Average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like
panel progression that fits the tone of the game.

Great tunes.

Easy to get into and hard to put down.

Cons:

Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2.

Poor enemy AI. Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in
combat. This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.

Lack of combo moves.

Lack of decent weapons.

Bad guy models are repeated far too often.",-0.009578020063665121

2058,3.0,"Pokemon Battle Revolution is anything but a revolution.  It feels like a step in the wrong directions sometimes.  Mostly, however, you just feel like the game wasn't complete... like it could use a lot more than we got.  Simply put, Battle Revolutions isn't bad, it's just a glass that's half full.  This is a game for only the most die-hard of Pokemon fans only.

Let's get the first big annoying thing out of the way.  If you don't have Pokemon Diamond or Pearl, then I highly suggest buying those before you actually dive into this game.  Otherwise you'll find your experience to be a pretty daunting one.  If you don't, you get passes with random Pokemon on them.  This is pretty sad considering other Pokemon games in this genre let you rent Pokemon.  Instead here, you're given six random Pokemon with random stats and moves.  You've no say in the matter, and that's just lame.  At least transferring your Pokemon from your DS games is no pain at all.

Let's get the second really annoying thing out of the way.  The menu is alright and everything, but your guide through the menu is really really annoying.  The guide has to explain everything.  And when I say everything, I'm not kidding.  If you're a seasoned gamer, you know what most of the stuff the guide is going to tell you is, yet you still have to sit through it anyway.  The good news is you only have to sit through it once.

Previous Pokemon Stadium games also gave you a more RPG like experience.  There was actually more to battling than just the sake of battling.  Here in Battle Revolutions, that's all you're doing.  You're battling just to battle... and you're battling endlessly.  There's no real reason why.  Of course, this isn't a HUGE problem, though, because in the long run battling is quite fun.  I just wish there was some kind of objective here, and some kind of reward to show your achievements to your friends.  Not found here.  Of course, there will be some who really love this.  After all, the point of battle revolutions is to do just that: Battle.

Seeing all your favorite Pokemon from Diamond and Pearl is a real treat indeed.  The game has a cartoon like look, but that doesn't mean it isn't impressive.  In truth, it is.  It doesn't take the Wii to its limits, but again, no Pokemon game ever really pushes a system to its limit.  But the game looks good for what is.  Visually the game is great.  It's the other aspects of the graphics that I sometimes find pretty lacking.  It suffers from the same thing Pokemon has suffered from for years.  There's hardly a whole lot of animation going on.  You simply watch your Pokemon step forward and perform the attack, and then you see the other Pokemon take damage.  There's no interaction between the Pokemon.  It's a limitation that doesn't make combat less exciting, but over the past few years you do kind of wish your Pokemon would actually... you know... look like they're battling each other rather than just standing there idly.  Regardless, combat is still pretty solid, and much like the DS games, pretty addictive.

As far as DS and Wii connectivity go, this game shows that it can be done.  As you can transfer your Pokemon from your DS to your Wii wirelessly.  However, you get the feeling so much more could've been done with it.  Unless Nintendo plans on making a ""DS Player"" for the Wii, I can't imagine why they wouldn't let you play through your DS games on the big screen.  Again, it's not a big set back, but it is a step back from other Pokemon Stadium installments.  There's also the excitement over using your DS as a controller, but even that feels incomplete sometimes.  Simply because you can't use your DS as a controller in the main game.  You CAN, however, use the DS as a controller when playing against a friend.  It feels limited, though.  Otherwise you can use your Wii-Remote like an NES controller or use the motion sensor controls to point and click.

Now there's the online experience.  This is the first real true taste of an Online gaming experience on the Wii.  Unfortunately, like the rest of the game, it feels a bit... incomplete.  The only thing you can do online is battle.  And the battles are all random.  To be honest, if all I wanted to do online was battle... I'd just boot up my DS copy of Diamond or Pearl, and they let you do more online than this game does.  It just feels like the online mode in this game was a test to see if they could actually do it.  The test is a success, but the experience is pretty stale overall.

This isn't the kind of game you buy for curiosity's sake.  A lot of it really does feel incomplete.  There's so much potential here, but the overall product feels as though it were rushed.  Previous Pokemon Stadium games had a lot more substance to them.  Pokemon Battle Revolutions is, for the most part, fun.  It just doesn't include a whole lot of content worth getting excited about... because the things that we were getting excited about aren't really all that exciting.  You're pretty much only going to buy this game to battle... but why spend 50 bucks to do so when you could just as easily spend 35 bucks on the DS games?  Besides, without those DS games you can't enjoy the full experience of battling in this game anyway.  It's a good ""test"" to see what the Wii can do, but hopefully the next Pokemon Stadium game will actually push the structure to its limit.",0.010429282792852088

Additionally, unlike the Sony headset, the clip on this cannot be removed or swapped over to the other side, so the headset MUST be used in your right ear. This means, of course, that you can't swap ears during long gaming sessions to prevent fatigue or long-term discomfort.

Featured prominently on the front of the package is the ability to change the camo pattern. To me, this is a non-feature. YOU cannot see the camo color of the headset when you are wearing it and who cares what color other people see?

2066,3.0,"There is nothing new to be found in ""Modern Warfare 3."" There are evil Russians, conspiracy theories, and grizzled soldiers protecting freedom. More importantly, there are explosions and extensive use of high-powered weaponry. At no point in this game will you see something you've never seen in other games, outside of perhaps the Eiffel Tower collapsing right in your face (well, Twisted Metal already did that, so never mind). If I were to score this game on originality, it would be a miserable bloody failure.

But much like I would never judge a Michael Bay film against something by, say, David Lynch, I'm not going to compare Infinity Ward's latest against other, more original games. Instead, I am going to compare it to other FPS games on the market. By that standard, it is an always-entertaining, cheesy popcorn movie of a game. Much like every Summer must have an explosion-packed action movie with scant substance, every Winter must have a predictable action game with great set pieces and an astoundingly predictable formula. That game is exactly what ""Modern Warfare 3"" is, and in that category, it succeeds.

Picking up where ""MW2"" left off, we're put in the shoes of various military members from different governments around the world. They're all tasked with tracking down and killing the elusive Makarov, a sadistic Russian who dabbles in mass genocide and usage of nuclear weapons. Along the way, you must work through approximately half the Big Book o' Action Movie Cliches to reach the villain. Rescuing a president and his daughter? Check. Avenging a dead friend? Check. Realizing that a partner is a traitor, only to realize that he's a traitor for the right reason? Check and check. As mentioned above, this plot is complete filler, and only exists to rationalize the carnage that is occurring around you every second of your experience.

What glorious carnage it is, though. Very rarely can I say that a game has no lull in action, but there wasn't a single instant in ""MW3"" where I felt that I was out of immediate danger. Buildings around you are always on the verge of collapsing, lethal enemies always have backup, and for every step you take you can be guaranteed where you're standing will be in pieces within five minutes. This is a true blue, dyed-in-wool action experience, made for those who can't stand games that are more subtle and are paced more slowly. It certainly is fun, and I had a blast in the single player campaign.

But even so, the whole experience with the CoD series is beginning to feel a bit tired. Explosions everywhere, bullets whizzing by, formulaic military banter... you know what to expect by now, and it just doesn't feel as fresh as it once did. Much like most critics, if not Hollywood itself, got tired of Michael Bay after a few movies, I fear that Activision's juggernaut is going to soon fall victim to it's own success. By sticking to the same layout in every game, both Infinity Ward and Treyarch have shown that they care more about sales than originality. This year's ""Black Ops 2"", which has already been unofficially announced, offers no light at the end of the tunnel.

As games like ""Borderlands"", ""Bulletstorm"", and ""Metro 2033"" have proved, the FPS market is not dead in terms of originality. But the military sub-genre is, and unless one brave developer steps forth, it's going to go the way of the dinosaur soon, and be overtaken by some other genre that the lowest common denominator will adore, and legions of more ""alternative"" gamers will despise. It's just the way the market works.

Back on topic, ""MW3""'s graphics are predictably great. That's to be expected with the type of budget the developers are given to play around with in this series, and I would hazard to say that anybody could produce amazing results with such virtually limitless funds. Every rendering of the major cities that get ravaged in this game is completely accurate, giving off a unique feeling with each new set piece introduced. It's great fun watching as everything blows up around you, giving off a desperate sense of urgency that has always been the series' strongest suit. Even though we've seen the landmarks in ""MW3"" get destroyed in other forms of media before, Infinity Ward definitely has a certain cinematic flair for making it feel engaging and panic-inducing. It's definitely a distinguishing feature in this series to have such catastrophic events happen in gameplay versus cutscenes, and it's what makes this more fun than the rest. If nothing else, this game is a serious looker.

Not much can be said about the sound. The soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect from an action-intensive game. An orchestra plays dramatic music when you see a city get destroyed or a landmark fall, guitars wail as your characters get access to heavy weapons and cut through waves of enemies. The music is incredibly forgettable, and the same can honestly be said for the voice talent. While there are some definitely great actors at work here, such as the criminally underrated William Fichtner, they're all delivering such wooden dialogue that it's hard to care about anything they're saying. As for explosions and gunshots... well, they sound like explosions and gunshots. So that's good, I guess?

""Modern Warfare 3"" is not a bad game, nor is it a great game. It hits all of the sweet spots, and I'd be lying if I said there weren't a few moments that made me genuinely excited, such as the submarine level and the final showdown with Makarov. I had fun with every second of it, but much like the aforementioned popcorn movies, I forgot about my experience a day or two after finishing it. It's all style over substance, and while there is a time and place for that, it certainly isn't with games that succeed on a far deeper level such as the ""Uncharted"" or ""Resistance"" series. Activision's biggest hit is starting to show it's battle scars, and sooner than later, it's going to have be honorably discharged.

In most games you'd be screwed in a position like this, but not in Enter the Matrix.  One guard comes in to grab you but with a front kick and an upper cut you easily take him out.  Two other guards charge in, but you take down one with a flurry of punches, and you grab the other guard and throw him into a wall, knocking him out.  The last guard runs in quickly and try's to kick you but you run up the adjacent wall land behind him a crack his Neck with one stroke.  Oh yeha and you did all this with only using three buttons.  Now do you see why I am hooked?  But sadly there is a bad part.  First off the graphics Suck. They're not as bad as an N64 game but they come close at times.

2071,3.0,"Battlefield 3... what can be said about it? A lot really. I'll try and keep this fairly short as I just did a huge review for The Old Republic and my typing fingers are tired. To start off as I most often try and do in any review is display my system specs. So here goes:

Asus M4A87TD EVO motherboard (onboard sound)
AMD 1075T 6 core processor (3.0ghz)
MSI Twi Frozr II OC 2GB 6950 graphics card
BFG Tech 1000 Watt power supply (Bronze)
Eclipse II Keyboard (USB) / Razer Deathadder 3800 dpi Mouse (USB)

It's far from the best but even further from the worst. So, it helps with determining frame rates, graphics, bugs, etc. So let's get going.

Installation:

I myself bought a copy from Direct2Drive who is now joining forces with an online rental company. But it allowed me to input my code into Origin (I'll explain) and download the game. I was an Alpha and Beta tester so I needed three separate installations which did not carry over. Something that was a tad annoying.

Running the Game:

Now Origin is EA's response to Steam. It's an application that you can launch games from and purchase them as well. But for some odd reason it's REQUIRED for this game even though it technically launches from a new website called, ""Battlelog"". Origin is a pain in the butt. If I could get rid of it (and Steam) I would. I want the old days of putting my disc in and running the game.

Battlelog is EA's way of having a social website where you can display stats and track one another. You launch the game from there and choose servers to join. It's FAR from perfect, but definitely a neat addition to the series. I myself have been playing Battlefield since 1942 (the game, not the year).

Playing the Game:

Once in if you're not hounded by the many bugs (like launching the campaign even though you're going into the multiplayer, or EA server disconnections, failed log in attempts, etc)... the game really is fun. Some of the maps are extremely small to which I just refuse to play. EA/DICE promised maps twice as big as any other game in the franchise, and they didn't quite deliver on that... yet.

The game itself allows you to pick a number of classes, each with their own assigned equipment that you can swap out. As you level you also gain access to the ""general"" equipment and can swap those in and out of every class. I myself prefer the Assault class which gives fairly decent ranged weapons at the expense of rate of fire.

Some people will recognize the BF2 naming system for the classes. The weapon choices are similar though I can't see why they made so many blatant changes like giving C4 to support (bring back the Special Ops class and call it Force Recon).

General Gameplay:

I don't see the spawn camping that I saw in BC2 (Bad Company 2)... but then I don't see the large scale battles as much as I saw in BF2 (Battlefield 2). Some of the maps have a TON of vehicles which is great... but then they overpower the infantry. You end up with everyone in a vehicle and take away the need to use troops on the ground. Fix that by allowing point captures by infantry only (on Conquest) and problem solved.

The game allows for a bunch of difference game types, but to be honest I play only Conquest. I want a game that requires team play and rewards you for it. When I say team play, I also mean 64 players.

Graphics:

The graphics are about as good as we'll see in a first person shooter. Highly detailed, high definition, and crisp. I like what I see and couldn't be much happier about it. I run the game on complete full graphics (Ultra settings) with VSync off, and love it.

Sound/Music:

Not a fan of the sounds. They hyped this stuff up during development to have gotten realistic sounds. I was an active duty Marine in the infantry and almost NONE of the weapons sound like they should. The vehicles don't match the vehicles I personally drove or rode in, and where the hell is my jeep horn?! The music is decent, but it's not that frequent.

Controls:

The infantry controls are standard... I love the single button stance up/stance down. That's something often overlooked in most games and rarely found. The vehicle controls are ok, but often times unresponsive. Forget about flying with a mouse and keyboard. I get by fairly well with it, but a joystick is a MUST.

Stability/Network:

As far as the game goes... I don't run into too many problems with crashes or disconnects. It happens usually at the start when first connecting but then never during the game. What I do experience a LOT and it's a problem from back to Battlefield 2 is hit detection. That's when you fire at someone and they take no damage because the round doesn't ""connect"" with them even though it's clearly obvious by blood or X indicators that he was hit. This is due to the network code not creating a stable bridge between the players and server. I think it's probably the single worst element of BF3 that needs to be fixed sooner than later. We saw this in BC2 and as far back as BF2. Time to wake up DICE.

Limited Edition/Back to Karkand:

I got myself a Limited Edition copy of the game and the Karkand expansion is now out. I'm a fan of most of the new maps, but have serious issues with Oman. On the servers I've played the map on, there seems to be a memory leak with the map that crashes the server. It'll play through once ok, but then on the second pass the server lags out and then crashes. This was experiences EVERYTIME on a new server. A problem I sure hope they fix soon.

Conclusion:

All in all it's a fun game. It's a great addition to the franchise but it needs some serious work. When I told EA/DICE the game wasn't ready for release during the beta, I meant it. It's clearly obvious I was right. I'd give the game a 3.5 star if possible... it's fun but can be absolutely frustrating at times with the net code problems.",0.009142794642674729

2077,3.0,"There is so much you can say about professional sports. While so many people who love video games prefer playing video game sports over seeing professional sports teams. With all of those, the essence of football games like Madden '06, and basketball titles such as NBA Live by Electronic Arts have conquered the marketplace, soccer games haven't actually caught on very well. While Nintendo did strike the nail on the head with the highly-hyped Super Mario Strikers, other systems have yet to hit that level of goal-making magic. Can EA's Street series make it happen for International Football for Americans? Here is the answer.

FIFA Street 2 for the Playstaion 2, tries to bring out the appeal of soccer, with the attitude Electronic Arts captured with NBA Street V3, and other Street titles. You have all sorts of countries to tackle inorder to take the crown of underworld soccer, such as Mexico, U.S.A., United Kingdom, and Brazil. The game also tries to captures the feeling of moves of tricks with the gamebrakers for trick stick combos, but doesn't capture the feeling of actual soccer madness. The graphics are greatfully detailed within each soccer court and player, and the music is very upbeat with the detailed expression EA placed before with other Street titles. The control however is quite frustrating, and can sometimes cost you from making your goals and acheivements.  Not to mention it isn't very challenging for people who've defeated other soccer titles.

All in all For Playstation 2 owners, FIFA Street 2 isn't a bad title, but it just is missing a few kicks that should've been worked out. I just hope that there are better titles for Soccer fans for this system. If you own a Playstation 2, and you have the need for soccer madness, you're better off kicking it for another soccer game.

2085,3.0,"I bought this after talking with several friends from another MMO.  I was told that it was the ""next generation"" and was totally different from anything I'd played before.  Having played most of the major MMOs of the last 3 or 4 years and looking for something new, I decided to give it a try.

The launch was smooth with a couple minor exceptions.  I was able to log in on the first night and only major problem was the auction house was down for the first few weeks.  If you choose a busy server there is a pretty good chance you'll be moved to the overflow server every so often, but it's not too big an issue.

The character creation is pretty good and once in game the graphics are great.  The major cities feel epic and the world you play in is huge.  I have a level 28 character and it seems like there is always somewhere new for it to go.  The combat is responsive, and I really haven't seen any issues with lag.

The negatives for me are partially due to my own expectations.  The combat while entertaining is nothing that hasn't been done in other MMOs.  You get certain abilities based upon your weapons and class, and you can switch weapons on the fly during battle (which is cool).  There is no tank/healer classes, so you are responsible for your own health, but it is pretty easy to work with.  The combat is basically running through your rotation of skills, watching your positioning/health, and not standing in stuff.  It's runs smoothly, but it's feels pretty repetitve.  There may be some more depth in the combat system at higher levels, but I haven't seen it yet.

Questing seems to be handled through three ways, a main story based upon your character, random instances, and helping various villages/people you meet in your travels.  The main story line is functinoal but standard fantasy game faire, though again I'm fairly early into it.  Random instances were a bit of a disappointment, they're an escort, gathering, or killing quest that randomly pop up on the map. Sometimes the quests will string together to tell more of a story, but mostly it's just a whole lot of people mindless killing one enemy or a group of enemies.  There is very little strategy or teamwork needed. The last way is helping the various towns and villages you run into in your travels.  They will request you kill so many of certain enemies, gather certain materials, or perform certain task (feed cows, catch bugs, rouse drunks. etc.).  After you complete a preset amount of their tasks you will receive some coins and their vendor will deal with you.  The is all fine, but again it's just your typical MMO stuff with a different presentation.

I'm not going to go into to any detail on the PVP part of the game because I really haven't explored much of that yet.

With no monthly fees, I feel like I got my money's worth so far and will probably continue to slowly level my character over the next few months. I was torn between three and four stars, because I think that some of the depth I'm hoping to see will be revealed at later levels.

2090,3.0,"I played many hours of the first Godfather and enjoyed almost every second of it. The thought of receiving upgrades when controlling a racket sounded great in practice, but didn't benefit me as much as I would have liked. Here are a few of my other observations from the game:

* Weaken rival families
I like this addition. Go through and use your special execution styles to take out key players in your opponent's crew. In some cases this was as easy as walking up to the person and using the garrote, while other required much more finesse and some luck (hitting someone between the eyes). The favor system was pretty lame, in my opinion. It usually went like this...
Walk up to person, talk, take job. Either do job or search for another favor. At one point my map had all the red indicators for favors. I totally lost track of how many mafia members I had gained access to by completing the favors. I don't think this was that well thought out.

* Dictate family members
I'm torn on the skills aspect of the game. I understand the need for it, but I think it was underdeveloped. This could have been a more important aspect of everything, but it almost seemed like more of an afterthought than anything. By that I mean you could go through the entire game without using any of the skills if you didn't want to. It helped on several occasions, but I think it should have played a more integral part in things. Another addition is when you control where family members protect/defend. You can't be everywhere at once, so being able to assign or send people elsewhere helped out in times of need.

* Gun upgrades
Instead of buying upgrades like in the first one, you mysteriously stumble upon them at different points, most of the time in boss houses. Both sides have their drawbacks, but I would rather know when and where I can upgrade rather than missing something and having to search high and low for it (that's just me). Luckily most of them were pretty obvious, but there was at least one where I had to look it up and it turns out I walked right by it because it didn't look like anything special.

* Length of the game
This was a much shorter game than the first. I decided to work on all the rackets and had near completion when I finished one mission and a large number of my businesses were taken from me. This upset me to no end and made me wonder why I'd spent all the time taking them over. Also, once you finish the main story there's not much else to do. Sure you can run around with all your cool new upgrades and battle with the cops, but has no point and gets old rather quick. I was hoping for something more but it didn't deliver.

It was a good game but not without its flaws. I would suggest buying it for $10 or less or renting it for the weekend. Even better, get the original!",0.03975258927445681

2096,3.0,"PSP gamers are hungrier for RPGs than Cookie Monster is for chocolate chips. With that said, even a traditional, generic RPG can make some noise. G-Artists' PoPoLoCrois is that traditional, generic game that somehow manages to captivate while being a generally solid RPG. It's cute, it's relatively quick, and it's simple enough that you won't be reaching for a strategy guide. But it's also very bland and the random battles simply have to go.

In case you haven't heard of it (which wouldn't surprise me at all), PoPoLoCrois is actually a moderately popular anime/RPG series overseas. It's no Dragon Ball, but there is a fanbase and because of that, there were two PoPoLoCrois games released on the PlayStation. Those two games are the same games featured here, as PoPoLoCrois for the PSP is essentially a remake. Due to that, the story feels very clich&eacute;d. You play as a 10-year-old boy named Pietro, who is as generic a character as can be. His mother, secretly a powerful white dragon, was put into a deep and fatal sleep after saving the land of PoPoLoCrois from the evil Ice Demon. Its Pietro's drive to save his mother that sends you across the land full of villages, futuristic castles, underground mines, and mountaintops in search of a legendary book that contains the secret needed to save his mother and the land of PoPoLoCrois. A few twists and turns along the way will keep Pietro's quest interesting, but for the most part, it's pretty generic.

There isn't a single character in PoPoLoCrois that will grab your attention or rip your heart out like in other RPGs. They're not as serious, even though Pietro is pretty upset about his mom's situation. To their credit, everyone in PoPoLoCrois is, for the lack of a better word, cute. Pietro is a short, squat little boy with a ponytail. He wears a green tunic and carries around a small sword. His witch friend Narcia is a petite little character with a big and pointy pink hat. The bumbly White Knight reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy IX's Steiner, as they're both noble but relatively dim-witted and surprisingly outlandish characters. Last of all is the Gami Gami Devil, a sinister little man indeed, who begins the game as a nuisance and ends up lending a helping hand. The NPCs found in the game are charming as well, not to mention some of them are hilarious. I remember very early in the game running into a man standing next to an elevator. When I talked to him, he proclaimed his fascination with the elevator and ended by saying something like, &#8220;I like elevators. I think I'm a loser.&#8221; I don't really know why, but it was the little stuff like this that made me laugh harder than I normally would. Also, the fact that one of the game's means of transportation is a floating, flying, white whale has to catch some attention. So you won't be crying over anyone here like you did with Aeris in Final Fantasy VII, but you can definitely find some entertainment.

With the story and characters aside, there's a decent RPG here in terms of gameplay. It's pretty plain&#8212;you'll run from town to town, usually completing quests that have little to do with your actual goal. The random battle encounters in-between every level are endless and they can get pretty annoying, but they're not bad to say the least. Much like the 25-hour story, at least they're relatively quick&#8212;the enemies in PoPoLoCrois, for the first half of the game, can usually be defeated in a single attack or magic spell. It's not until the second half when the battles start getting much tougher and you're forced to think about the turn-based battles. Unlike most turn-based RPGs, PoPoLoCrois is played on a strategic grid rather than a solid, cemented line. I only wish that there was a little more variation in terms of battle strategy&#8212;for most of the game, my two battle plans were either to circle the enemy and relentlessly attack or pull back, use all of my magic points, and cast spells until the battle was over. I don't think I even used a healing item until I was a good ten hours into the adventure, because the Inns found at every town heal you for such a cheap charge that it makes damage a pretty simple thing to deal with. Healing spells also replenish a huge percentage of health, so staying alive is much easier for most of the game than it should be. It erases some frustration found with other RPGs that feature random battles&#8212;at least you won't be dying every five minutes&#8212;but it makes PoPoLoCrois feel too cheap and simple.

I'm not impressed by PoPoLoCrois in any way with the visuals. The art style and colorful scheme are both very nice touches that help to provide PoPoLoCrois' charm. It looks unique and as a result the clich&eacute;d story is backed up with a little creativity from the style. But those two factors don't really compensate for the fact that the game, overall, looks very dated. So dated, in fact, that I would say the GBA's four-year-old classic Golden Sun looks much better. The only saving grace here are the anime cutscenes, which look fantastic and were a real treat when the story started picking up. The music is pretty catchy, at least&#8212;and the voice acting in the cutscenes is very true to the anime style. It's a shame that there isn't as much oomph with the visuals or the music. They both would have made this game a lot more exciting to play over an extended period of time. Rather than lavish spells and powerful-looking attacks that pound audio out of the PSP's speakers, you'll see ho-hum magic and quick sword chops that don't sound very exciting at all.

It's no surprise to me that PoPoLoCrois has never reached America until now. It's a pretty bizarre, obscure little title. With a name like PoPoLoCrois, it's not hard to see why people are scratching their heads and moving on to the other PSP RPG, Legend of Heroes: A Tear of Vermillion. After all, it sounds and looks more like an RPG from simply looking at the box. But give PoPoLoCrois a chance, it's the best RPG you're going to play on Sony's little handheld for a while. Until a Final Fantasy game unleashes the Ultima spell on the PSP, you're going to have to settle for less&#8212;and PoPoLoCrois makes the most out of its dated concept and random battle encounters with entertaining characters and a lot of charm.

2097,3.0,"I've been a fan of the Final Fantasy games for a long time. Even the games that didn't go over with fans so well I usually enjoyed. VIII was one of my favorites, gun swords and all, and while X had a less-than-satisfying ending (probably why they made X2), getting there was a lot of fun.

XIII has a lot going for it. The graphics are good enough that at times it's hard to tell when they cut to a pre-rendered scene and some battle moments are just so fun (punching bad guys so hard they turn into ash? That's awesome). But there are some things that are just, well, bad mistakes on the developers' behalf.

First of, the battle system is just ridiculous. You're only in control of one character in any given fight. You can change the strategy of other characters, but you can't choose their actions. Being able to choose the actions of ALL characters in a fight has been a staple of the FF series since the beginning, and I hate giving that up. That said, because of the complexity of the battle system (it takes hours and hours before you've even learned how to play the damn game) and the fact that the clock is always running (you can slow down the battles, but this will reduce your potential score greatly) would make it virtually impossible to controll all your characters anyways.

Second, leveling has been made, if anything, even more tedious. While running around a field for hours on end was a bit dull, there was a certain excitement to suddenly and unexpectedly getting into a fight and not knowing what you were fighting. In fact, in a lot of ways, that was the only thing that got me through the tedium. That's gone. Not only can you see your enemies before the fight, but they're the same enemies over and over again at the same exact spot! Leveling has become running back and forth between two spawn points to fight the same fights over and over and over.

Lastly, you have to spend your experience to gain abilities. I know this isn't completely new to the FF series, but I find this new system a lot more irritating. Different combat styles are broken down into paradigms. Every character has multiple paradigms, and each of those paradigms has a different leveling section. So, you want to build up a character's healing abilities, you open up their medic paradigm in the menu and fill up the ability tree represented there, choosing which branch you want to follow when to gain different traits at different times. In the end, though, it all gets filled up with a fairly reliable pattern, and you've really got to level all aspects of your characters up to progress, so there just isn't anything gained by having the player do this manually. Not only that, but you max out depending on where you are in the game. You've filled the current level, but your level is controlled by progressing through the game and not experience. What this means is that over and over in the game you hit points where for long stretches you are as powerful as you can be. It doesn't sound so bad, but it just gets boring. You're still fighting, but you're not really getting anything out of it.

In the end, the actually playing of the game is pretty tedious and I found myself just trying to get through the parts where I was in control to watch the pretty movies.

It's not that it's a bad game, it's just why is it a Final Fantasy game. Aside from the Chocobo living in one character's hair (which really feels tacked on), there isn't much to tie this to the other FF games. And yes, that's part of the charm of the FF series, no two games are the same story or even universe (barring, of course, FFX and FFX2), but the familiarity of the game play is why I keep buying them. Small things change, but I still know how to play the game, and I get a completely new and remarkably fulfilling story. This time, I had to spend so much time learning to do everything all over again that by the time I'd finished learning I just didn't care anymore.",0.00521303905964445

2100,3.0,"Assassin's Creed 2 restored my faith in open world games. I've played every one of the AC games and each title has it's own strengths and weaknesses. Out of the entire lineup, Assassin's Creed III has some of the best characters and delivers one of the best stories in the series but not enough thought was put into so many important areas of gameplay that Assassin's Creed III turns into a flawed disappointment.

**THE GOOD**
-The characters are memorable. Here's the thing: Connor isn't Ezio, nor should he be. If you're looking for a wild, charismatic guy who flirts with ladies and does whatever he wants, then Connor is the exact opposite of that. In fact, I'd say Connor's personality is very true to his culture. If he acted like Ezio as a young boy, I'd imagine his people would have thought something was seriously wrong with Connor. His quiet and humble nature suits him well. The side characters have their moments as well. The interactions between Charles Lee and Thomas Hickey, as well and Haytham and Connor are very fun and keep the player in guessing what happens next. The characters on your Homestead are also very funny and a delight to help out from time to time.

-The story is also engaging. Seeing what you read as a kid during history class in elementary school brought to life and getting to play in that environment is amazing! Being a part of the Boston Massacre and The Battle of Bunker Hill seriously gave me a special feeling inside. I'm not a history buff or anything, but the amount of research involved with both story and characters is done exceptionally well. For non-Americans, I've noticed a large disconnect with the events that happen in the game. A few of my European friends that played the game have stated this and found the story pretty dull. So a person not familiar with early American history may find the story a bit boring.

-The naval battles are so much fun that it should have been the entire game. Just sayin'.

-Wolfpack mode is perfect for those that don't like the competitive modes in multiplayer. It's pure co-op and it can even be completed on a solo run if you have no one to play with. The player can earn all the multiplayer trophies/achievements strictly playing that mode if they really wanted to. I think it's a wonderful addition to the online portion.

-The Desmond stuff isn't bad this time around and he finally feels like an assassin for once.

**THE BAD**
-Gameplay is a mess. It's not bad, but it could have been much better. The free-running is the same as it always has been, but Ubisoft has never fixed the issue of running up things you never wanted to climb in the first place. This becomes a hair-pulling experience when it accidentally happens during chase portions of the game. Another problem is sometimes when you walk casually past some Red Coats, they become aware of your presence and will come after you for no reason! It doesn't matter if incognito is your status, sometimes they will go to full alert and chase you for no reason. Sometimes I'll be chased by Red Coats and will run by Blue Coats. Guess what? They start chasing me too! Why?! They're two opposing forces and they should be fighting each other, not acting like buddies and chasing me! Lastly, the guns feel like it takes a lifetime to reload during fights. I know it's more realistic that way, but when you really need to use something other than your fists in a fight, you'll most likely choose other options before picking gun due to the reload speed.

-Tutorials aren't really helpful. The fighting could have used more of an explanation and the gameplay involving the Assassins you recruit by liberating areas of NY and Boston could have been more thorough. The mechanics will be familiar to people that played Brotherhood and Revelations, but individuals that haven't picked up the game since AC2 may feel a bit lost.

-Fight mechanics should have stayed the same. The Batman games by Rocksteady are amazing when it comes to fight mechanics and it's understandable why Ubisoft have stated that the Arkham games were a big inspiration for the overhaul. Honestly, it's not good in AC3. I'm not even sure why the slowdown animation during the failed parry attack exists, because even if Connor doesn't press anything during the animation, he pushes the enemy back automatically so you're able to try your attack again. If your looking for cool Arkham style fight mechanics, go with the game Sleeping Dogs. Otherwise, this just feels dumbed down and makes me miss the fantastic fluid fights I had in the past AC games.

-Not enough climbing points in the frontier. Sometimes I'd want to perform a hanging attack using my rope dart, but unfortunately, I would rarely find a climbable tree near an enemy for me to do this with. Like, there are soooo many trees. Some of them are like a puzzle to find the exact beginning climbing point. Then there are other trees that are just there to take up space for design reasons and aren't climbable. It becomes annoying, especially when you're looking for a way to get the upper hand on taking down an animal or enemy from the above position. Finding crevasses to climb in the mountains can become equally frustrating for the same reasons.

-The bugs cripple the experience. Even with all the flaws I've listed, I still would have been able to recommend this game to fans of the franchise. However, there are too many random bugs that make me wonder if Ubisoft were too concerned about making the Fall quarter release date that the Assassin's Creed series is known for, that they also managed to forfeit the quality of their product. I've seen so many random bugs and glitches. I can't tell you how many times I had to restart my checkpoint just to fix some of the issues. Sometimes even markers on the map don't show up like they should, so it makes finding objectives harder. I'm sure over time Ubisoft will patch a lot of the issues that exist in the game, but until that day comes, I'd gladly recommend Brotherhood and Revelations over AC3.

**OVERALL**
Assassin's Creed III isn't a bad game by design. It's the glitches and bugs that make it a bad game. It also feels like a poor effort was put into some of the gameplay elements. Even though the influences from Batman: Arkham Asylum/City to Red Dead Redemption turnout to be lackluster, the originality found in the naval battles is something completely new and maybe should be looked at in future releases of the franchise. They really have something special going on there. I thought this would be my Game of the Year for 2012. Even after playing a great game as Borderlands 2, I still believed AC3 would take my top spot. Yeah...Assassin's Creed III doesn't even come close to my Top 5 this year. AC3 is an okay game, but it feels like a disappointment over what the past titles did as far as gameplay and it should have been much better.",0.01262725131621537

2102,3.0,"I've never played Ultimate Alliance 1, so I can't compare the two. I got really excited when I heard about this game because I felt it brought something different to the table. I expected an epic experience based on all of the characters and different powers incorporated in this game. Well, I got an experience alright enough, wouldn't necessarily call it epic though.

Ultimate Alliance 2 initially appealed to me because it gives you the ability to choose from a host of characters, as well as play with 4 characters on the screen at the same time! I'm sure there are other games out there that allow you to do this, but this is the first game I've played that offers that.

The combat in this game is actually pretty fun. Each character has about 4 different abilities/powers that he/she can chose to use at any given time. You start off with 2 powers but you'll upgrade to 4 pretty quickly. You can also punch, kick, and throw bad guys just like you can in many other action type games. You are also granted a special power called 'fusion powers'. You can combine your unique fusion attack with another character's fusion attack to create chaos for anyone in the area. But, this may be minor to some people, but I absolutely LOVE that you can use the environment as a weapon!! You can throw boxes, crates, trash-cans, cars (depending on who you have), etc. The fighting can become redundant after awhile because you really can get through many of the enemies with simply punching and kicking, more on that later.

The variety of enemies is where this game starts heading in the wrong direction. I honestly believe I only fought around 4 or 5 different enemy types throughout the entire game. Batman AA is the only game that can get away with not having a huge variety of enemy types to fight, and we all know AA is a special game :) This is how it works: Enter a room, fight about 20 bad guys. Walk forward and enter another room, fight the exact same 20 bad guys that you just recently dispatched, repeat, repeat, repeat. Yes, you can use your super-powers to get through the bad guys, but you really don't have to. You can simply button mash your way through most of the enemies, I really hate that. Now, there were different bosses to fight, well somewhat. Although they WERE different bosses, they all fought the same way to a certain extent. I'm accustomed to games where the boss has a specific weakness, and you have to find it and exploit it. In Ultimate Alliance 2, you can use the aforementioned fusion attacks and send many of the bosses to an early grave; with the exception of maybe one or two. If you want a challenge, just hack and slash the bosses I suppose.

I was fooled into thinking that the 3 other heroes in my group were actually helping me through battle. Well, they don't.....My team was Storm, Deadpool, Thor, and Iceman. If I'm fighting 20 bad guys, simple math tells me that we should probably kill around 5 guys each. Yeah right.... you'll end up killing around 95% of all enemies. Sure, your team will hit the enemies, but they don't kill them for whatever reason. They do a great job of keeping enemies 'at bay' until you're able to help out. When I think of an army of 4, that's not what I envisioned...The length of the game is around 12 hours, although you can play through again and see a different outcome, depending on which side you choose. I'm not complaining about the 12 hours because if the game was any longer, I probably would have killed myself :(

I deducted 2 stars from this game because of the lack of variety with enemies, and because every level really felt the same. I felt as if I was playing the same levels over and over again, with the exception of the Jungle; they all looked and felt alike. I'm thinking this game could have been a 4 or 5 star game, if the developers put a little more thought into the enemies and the level designs.

I should have listened to the Amazon community on this one. Anytime a game has more 4 star ratings than it has 5 star ratings, that's a red flag. Although I had fun moments in the game, it just didn't live up to my expectations.",-0.011361538760530442

2104,3.0,"So at this point, some years after the original release of this game, mainstream hardware is at the point where this game will run smoothly on most machines.  This is good.

The mechanics and look of the game itself is much improved over the original - visually stunning, more and cooler moves, and plenty of action.  This too, is good.

The story itself though, well, how to put this...it's lame.  The voice actors do the best they can with banal dialogue and a shallow plot, but there's only so much one can do with it.  So this is bad.

Come to think of it (stunning visuals, lame-ass plot), it's basically in the same tradition as the Star Wars prequels.

In most games, the plot does tend to be secondary and I'm not dinging the game (too hard) for that.  Seriously, any chance to go to town with a lightsaber or two along with some push / lightning force attacks is generally a good thing.  But this game just isn't very deep, certainly not as deep as the original Wii version, with boring boss fights and awkward story skips.  There is a sequence where Starkiller goes to Dagobah for, well, no good reason except for the producers to apparently give Yoda a cameo.  It really doesn't advance the plot much if at all and just feels tacked on.

Anyway, if the game was exciting, if it didn't seem to simultaneously drag on and yet feel abbreviated, if there weren't obvious boss battles where I honestly started getting bored at the stupid things I had to do, it would rate higher.  But instead it comes across as a game that you feel like you have to play if you played the original...feel like you have to just to get it over with, that is.  And while the ending leaves the door open for another sequel, I'm not sure if I'm glad or not that there wasn't one.

The selection of weapons are superb from Glock, Desert eagle, Uzi, Ak-47, Spas 12, Jack Hammer, Dragunov, Colt Annaconda ect. But unfortunatly you cannot choose your weapons before the mission starts. And you cannot carry the weapons to the next mission even if it starts at the place where the previous mission ended. The level designing is very good but no training mission, Almost all the missions takes place outdoors with a few indoor sequences, The levels are very large and very hard to get through. It does not have a save game feature but it did not bother me because the gameplay is very good and non-boreing that to start the mission from the begining is not that frustrating. The enemy AI is very poor, They will react if they see you but when you are if you shoot one gaurd standing behind him his partner will not respond. In some missions if you shoot the security camera the alarm will go on and in some missions it does not. But still the security camera and alarms are the real threat, Because the alarm not only alerts gaurds it respawns gaurds. Gaurds will come from a room which was empty a few seconds ago, If you kill them all and turn off the alarm and when it goes on again more gaurds will come from the empty room. When you are playing this game you yourself will see gaurds reappear from thin air right in front of you, I have seen it a lot of times. The enemy AI may be super dumb but because of the no save game they are very threatining. If you are a fan of Nolf, Hitman, Rainbow Six ect then you will surely like Project IGI. Tip: Before you make you move into the mission use your binoculars to look arround, It will show you the enemy gaurds marked in red squares and it will be easy for you to know where the gaurds are.",0.00319988450294053

Season two was okay and decisions you have to make are difficult as usual but the decisions I made in ""400 Days"" didn't amount to anything.

2111,3.0,"I've been a fan of the Fallout franchise since I got ahold of Fallout Brotherhood of Steal. I loved Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas and I was really excited when Bethesda had announced that we were getting another Fallout to add to the experience but once I purchased and played the game I admit it was kind of a let down for both me and a few friends and family that enjoyed the Fallout franchise like I do. I felt that the use of settlement building took away way too much from the game as a whole considering it made the game feel like a Fallout version of Minecraft rather than an actual Fallout game. I've seen the Harvey memes so much but never really knew what they meant until now, every mission for the guy is either a settlement needs my help or needs to be created or supported in some way. I saw the same thing with the Brotherhood of Steal, the missions were played on a loop over and over for them whether it was killing mutated creatures or finding something. Needless to say I saw nothing more than side quests with no originality to them which got old extremely quick and kind of ruined the game. I did enjoy the graphics, weapons and weapon mods that were brought to the table along with the design of the mutant creatures, they're no longer these simple to enemies that run in a straight line at you. I enjoyed the addition of new enemies like the giant mosquitoes. I would like to mention that I'm not the gaming type to create and maintain things so of course I didn't enjoy that aspect of the game. I did enjoy it and recommend it for everyone to try out if you're a fan of the Fallout franchise.",-0.006517632829926852

But the reviews were so bad at release that I waited and picked the game up for 25 bucks as a Deal of the Day. I'm glad I didn't pay more because $25 is about right. The graphics are very weak compared to the PS3, even weaker than I imagined. But the saddest part of this game is the game play with the Wii remote and nunchuck. Some moves (force push, lightening) work well and are well suited to the Wii. But swinging the lightsaber and the choke especially are uncomfortable, difficult and sometimes impossible. So many of the moves call for the player to execute a three swing lightsaber combo and then press a button or do a motion. Many times I can't get Marek to even take three continuous swings so I just fall back to force push and lightening. The storyline is well done although the boards are repetitive. With all the worlds in Star Wars you wouldn't think you'd end up at the Jedi Temple on three separate occasions. All would be forgiven if only the gameplay was solid, but it most definitely is not.

This can actually make you nauseous in the same way, for example, that the Minnesota Twins were beaten by the Oakland A's to advance to the next round of the playoffs.

2118,3.0,"I am a huge fan of Rise of Nations.  It took the exciting real-time strategy formula of the Age of Empires games and perfected it.  I was hoping that Rise of Legends would be a worthy successor, and on a few levels it is.  However, after playing through the campaign and a few skirmishes, it's largely forgettable.

Gameplay: The game can be quite fun at times.  The three races are fairly distinct, with their own heroes, structures, and backstories.  The city building is perhaps the most innovative part of the game.  While there is some base sprawl that is characteristic of these kinds of games, it looks more orderly and planned.  The kinds of buildings that you build determine your progress up the tech tree.  Each race has a good selection of units.

The campaign serves to introduce you to the three races and their heroes.  The storyline is not particularly compelling and feels overly long by the time that you get to the end. It is a mix of metamap movement and real-time battles, but not as well done as in Rise of Nations and other games.  The game also has a skirmish mode, and the patches have added a healthy number of maps.  But the battles feel very ordinary, especially since none of the units have any voice acknowledgments or personalities.

Graphics & Sound: The game is very attractive.  Some of the maps are gorgeous.  The units are well-crafted and distinct, and the special effect are quite adequate.  The most disappointing thing about the game is that the units are so quiet.  After playing games like Dawn of War or Battle for Middle Earth 2 where each unit has spoken dialogue, to play a game that is largely silent just doesn't cut it.  It makes the whole experience flat and uninspired.  On the bright side, the music is very reminiscent of the excellent Rise of Nations soundtrack.

Documentation/Technical Issues: The manual that comes with the game is descent.  The game did crash on me a number of time in the campaign, even after patching.  Thankfully, you can save the game at any point and don't have to rely upon any checkpoint foolishness.

Replayability/Value: The campaign is worth a good playthrough and maybe a second one at some time.  The skirmish mode is really the hook for RTS games, but the one in this game is just too generic and devoid of character.  If you liked Rise of Nations, you'll probably be ambivalent toward Rise of Legends.  There are a number of things to like here and that will remind you of Rise of Nations.  However, it just doesn't quite measure up to the grand sweep and groundbreaking gameplay of its predecessor.",0.04676058250573879
2119,3.0,"I got one of these for Christmas, and to make a long story short, i liked it, but will be returning it. The 3D was pretty cool, some games support it well, others did a pretty poor job. The biggest problem with the screen on consoles is the glare, the screen is too damn glossy and if you have any light in the room it will reflect everything behind you. The color on the monitor was above average, but not what you would expect  with a gaming monitor, same with lights and darks. A huge downside to the monitor is response time, I'm not sure what they say it is, but it's slow enough that you can clearly see a delay in when you perform an action, and when it actually happens on screen (this is much more apparent when used as a PC monitor, than for consoles) still, all in all, if you really just want to have some fun and experience 3d on your PS3 or Xbox, this will get the job done, and for a decent price (299 at best buy).

 What really hurt this monitor for me was it's performance when used as a PC monitor, for some this won't apply, but I need a monitor that i can use for my PC and for gaming. A big slap in the face to the PC and 3d is the lack of a DVI port, seeing as it was designed for consoles that is however understandable. The display also isn't ""supported"" by any of the 3d drivers that are currently out there, some of the more forgiving 3rd party drivers will work, but performance is limited. The black eye, and reason I ultimately decided to return the display is that response time, on PC it is painful, weather or not 3d is being used there is a visible lag between mouse movement and the actually movement of the cursor in any game. This wouldn't be a problem for most game types, but seeing as i play mostly shooters this just isn't acceptable. Playing BF3 (which i never was able to get to display in 3D) there is about a .25 second delay between mouse movement and cursor movement in game, a quarter of a second doesn't seem like much, but it is enough to make and quick shooting completely impossible. The input lag was also present on other games and even when just moving the mouse cursor on the desktop. I tried everything to fix the problem, but in the end it was clear that the display was to blame.

 Other notes:
  - The speakers, they're better than standard monitor speakers, but even the cheapest external speakers would beat them, the ""sub-woofer"" does nothing and isn't even audible.
  - High gloss finish, could be used as a mirror.
  + The provided 3d glasses seemed to be of good quality, but are quite small and long periods of use get painful. (I do have a pretty big head though)
  *see update*+ Easily the cheapest 3D set up available right now.
  ? Might be worth waiting for the tech to settle in some more.

Just to be clear, if you are just buying this for your PS3 then it is probably your best bet, same as for your 360, Stay away as a PC monitor, and sadly, not the all-in-one 3D display i was hoping for.

*update*
 well I found the answer for me, the samsung S23A750D 3D monitor does all i wanted and more, i lost an inch (only a 23 inch monitor) but gained everything I wanted, and at 300 bucks from certain retailers it was a steal. -just a quick note this monitor used DP, which means you'll need an AMD/ATI card to use it's full potential, it has HDMI too for consoles.",0.019768709632169524

The ability to slide on stairways and still have the ability to shoot is another cool ability.  The only problem I had was when I went online to do the multiplayer version of the game...just did not have anybody on to play against.

2122,3.0,"This game holds a spot very near and dear to my heart as being my favorite surrivival horror game (and I've played a lot of them), so instead of getting all mushy on you all, I'll mearly give you some of the basics. Let me stat by saying that many people believe this game represents one of the finest examples of story telling to have ever graced a video game and I will spoil none of it in my review. The game, in short, combines the creepiness and mood from the first game, with the controlls and graphics of the 3rd. From it's opening scenes, the game draws you in and however horrific and disturbing things get on screen (and at times, they will get very disturbing), the game mearly becomes more addictive. As things go on, you find your self intrigued, not only with the story of the protagonist, but with the history of the setting of the story, the town of Silent Hill (i'm not giving anything away here... the name of the game is silent hill 2, and if you can't make some sort of assumption that the game takes place in Silent Hill, you need not bother with this game at all). like many other survival horrors, this game has fixed camera angles (sort of... you can push a button to put the camera behind your player, but this only works in some areas) that can become a little bothersome at first, but in the end help add to the suspence. It also has corny diolauge, but this can be easilly forgiven, as it does not take away from the mood that the game creates. Next up, this game is not for every one and is not a gore filled splatter-fest, but does feature some blood and several disturbing images that will stay with you for some time to come. I recomend the game to mature players... not only because of it's content, but because of it's story. The game does not spell out any thing for you, and there is a lot of symbolisim (i.e. many things you see hapen arround you, reflect things that have happened in you characters past, or in his mind.... and you have to make this assumption all on your own in many cases, wondering what something symbolises) and the story touches on many ""mature"" issues, such as child abuse, wedding vows, euthanasia, suicide, hommicide, and religion. After all the praise I have given the game, you may be wondering why I rated the orrigional SH2 with only 3 stars. This is because the orrigional game is not nearly as good as the ""Greatest Hits' version for ps2 or the ""restless dreams"" version for x-box (both versions are exactly the same). These versions contain many things that were not included in the orrigional game, such as more endings, more items, more options, and a different playable character, and her own short story/prolouge that you can play through (lasts about 30 min.s to 2 hours, depending on your skill :-) ) Because of this, the ""greatest hits"" and ""restless dreams"" versions are 5 star games while the orrigional is only 3 when compared to them. Be sure that if you are buying the game for ps2, make sure the box art has a red top, with ""greatest hits"" writen in the red. If you own an x-box, the restless dreams version is the only one availabe for the x-box so don't worry. In conclusion, This is one of the best survival horror games ever released, and scares you in a subtle, creepy way that very few games can. Including an award-winning story, easy to learn controlls, good graphics (The graphics are saposed to look grainy.... after you beat the game once, you can make them smooth and turn off the grainy filter) and a healthy amout of replay value, this is one game that belongs in any survival horror fan's collection. .",0.009026124781813898
2123,3.0,"I don't understand how this game is getting the reviews it is. To me this game is about a 7 out of 10.

I want to start this by saying that I had few problems with bugs. I had several problems with frame rate issues, especially as my play time increased. Unlike Skyrim I never once had the game freeze.

My biggest problem with the game is that the RPG elements are minimized. I think that VATS is useless, as I had better accuracy when I aimed down the gun sights than in VATS. The games story is also a big disappointment. Lazy side quests that are pretty much just fetch quests, and after playing the Witcher 3 and the unique side quests that game had I don't think Fallout 4 can get away with it's poorly done side quests.

The thing that I was most excited for with this game was it's settlement building, but it felt like it was something that was just added on at the end of development. Their was little to no explanation of how to use this feature, or, if there was I didn't see it.

But, with all of those problems I had with the game, I still had a lot of fun with it. Even though I had problems with the settlement building, I spent a lot of time in it, building up Sanctuary. I also had a lot of fun exploring, and to me that is this game's strong point.",-0.03723092813373663

The graphics are nice...but the problem is that it seems there is no anti aliasing which i find leaves the game looking a tad ""rough"" around the edges so to speak...would have been nice to had this option for the game.

The controls are simple enough though for it being ""real time"" combat an easier dodge option with the arrow keys would have been nice.

The main problem i have is that the interface is way too small expecally text on default settings on 720p it is very hard to read you have to scale up the UI but that makes some elements too big (like the chat window which you cannot re-size it seems.

even a bit bigger the text in some areas like item descriptions are still very small which is a bit frustrating..

I would encourage anyone considering getting the boxed version to try the streaming client first you only need to download about 4 gigs and then you can play the game for yourself then consider if you want to buy the boxed version.

Its pretty good but if the UI didn't feel so small/cluttered it would be just a tad better.  But not bad for something that is now free to play!

I was fortunate enough to land two brand new out-of-box controllers for a good price on eBay. This was years ago, so Im sure prices have risen since.

Unfortunately, there can be lots of bootlegs out there. The only way to tell if its genuine is to have the official pics pop up in the listing. Otherwise, theres no way to tell for sure.

I use my NES as a USB controller via the RetroUSB adapter, or else on my Virtual Console games via another adapter by RetroUSB, which is made for the GCN ports. It works well, and Im glad I got a new one. However, since I had a barely operable NES as a kid, I didn't exactly grow up with the system, so Im not terribly used to using it for long sessions. As such, the controller becomes somewhat uncomfortable to use. Its mainly the fact that the shape is a flat rectangle, so the corners dig into my palms. That, and the controller is kind of small for adult hands.

Its nice to use an original NES controller, but I prefer the revision NES controller, what many dub dogbone. It arrived after the SNES after Nintendo redesigned their NES system into a top-loading format. Its more comfortable, though some don't like the angled AB buttons.

2131,3.0,"Please remember this is only a review of about 5 hours of my online experience in Team Assault.

Why did I only play multiplayer?  Simply because I find that most single player (campaign) modes in FPS games (especially Modern Warfare shooters) follow simliar storylines and they are rarely worth any sort of hands on review.  Show some screenshots and you have pretty much covered it.  Other than maybe frame-rate and other bugs or issues, of course.

That said.

This game is a fun one to pop in and dive into an online skirmish.  It will irritate many people because of the incessant camping that takes place.  However, many of these things can be easily overcome with teamwork.  While I do realize that teamwork and online team deathmatch shooters don't really go hand-in-hand you should really give it a shot, lest you get spawn camped for an entire round.

If you are a MW2 or BFBC2 fan (or fanboy) you will fall into a gray area with this game.  There are kill-streak rewards and a run and gun attitude among many of the early adopters of this game (as of 10/13/10) which will please MW2 fans.  Also present (by default) is the R3 Click To Stab button instead of BFBC2's RB Button.

As for the BFBC2 Fans, the gunplay is a bit toned down from Bad Company 2's crazy realistic recoil action.  However, I have had minor problems getting a feel for sniper rifles.  Is there 'bullet drop'?  Do my bullets disappear?  Whatever it is that was happening to me last night I had to quit trying to snipe and stick with assault rifles.

I can't guarantee anyone will love this game and call it their favorite of all-time.  I think it is more of a game you will want to find for a decent price pre-owned.  EA knows a lot of their games are going this direction because they are including 'online passes' now that unless you have the game new you will most likely have to pay for any sort of extra online content.",-0.007447502323484974

2134,3.0,"I've long been a fan of the Street Fighter II series on the SNES. When I heard there was going to be a GBA version, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. And while it's fun to play, it's far from perfect.
First, the good stuff. The graphics are nice, and stay true to the original (as do the sound effects). Arcade mode is a blast to play, and the various little bonus games you can unlock are pretty cool.
But there are, unfortunately, some significant problems with the game. Firstly, there's the fact that the GBA has two less buttons than the SNES. The control scheme is customizable, thankfully, but it takes time to get used to it. Finger-cramping is pretty common after playing for a long period of time, even if you're used to playing the GBA for extended sessions.
Another downside is the music. To put it simply, it's bad. We're talking barely Game Boy Color quality here, and it's a real shame. Part of the charm of the SF2 games is the cool music, and unfortunately this aspect did not carry over well to the GBA at all.
And one other gripe - the game can crash. After unlocking Akuma, he can be your opponent in the arcade mode. But unfortunately, the game crashes and burns horribly 9 times out of 10 when it brings me to him in the arcade ladder. A console game crashing under normal usage is a Very Bad Thing(tm), and that's ultimately what brings this game's rating down from 4 stars to 3 stars in my book.
Conclusion: SF2 for GBA is fun, but in many regards it just doesn't do justice to the SNES versions. When you see awesome conversions like Mario Kart Super Circuit, and compare them to this somewhat lacking port of Street Fighter II, its faults can become pretty glaring.",-0.007543740615084828
2135,3.0,"After three increasingly well-written and designed games, Law & Order: Criminal Intent is a depressing letdown. The stories are less compelling, the graphics less convincing, and they've done away with the courtroom side altogether. Much of the crime-solving comes down to pixel-hunting -- slowly and painfully sweeping every molecule of a scene until you find a hotspot that reveals some invisible clue. Maddening! and unsatisfying, since it means you can't solve the crimes by deduction, only by tripping over the evidence.

The acting too is erratic. Most of the no-name actors are pretty good, but D'Onofrio seems to have gone through the whole thing either hungover or really disgusted that he has to do this kind of thing. There's no point in hiring the TV actors to do the voices if they can't be bothered to give it their all, guys.

Added to that, the program itself is buggy and has a slapdash air. On my 3-month-old machine, it crashed, crashed, crashed, until I was saving every five minutes and cursing the air blue.

THE BAD:
1.  Impossible to hit enemies near walls-- the bullets just hit the air and the nazis turn around and shoot at you.  (of course, they never miss)

3.  Enemy soldiers do not always ""die"" when shot at very close range, even with weapons that could put a hole through the engine block of a Chevy.
4.  MANY MANY MANY graphical glitches.  You can walk throgh certain NPCs, enemies that fall from heights after being shot will sometimes freeze there, headfirst on the ground, with their legs flailing wildly

The detail is fantastic, and many times you'll catch yourself thinking ""this looks real!"".

1. Car selection is thin!
C'mon Polyphony, compared to other games, this Gran Turismo has a weak selection of vehicles to choose from. Some brands only have 1 car model but 4 different versions of it! That's not what I call a ""selection"". Other games definitely have more cars to choose from, and when it comes down to it, drivers like me want to drive cars - I don't need accurate 4k HDR scale representations of a dashboard. I don't buy driving games to take virtual photos, I buy driving games to drive.

2. No crash damage. Still.
You'd figure by now they would catch up to the other games as far as this feature goes, but no. Gran Turismo keeps calling itself the ""ultimate driving simulator"" and yet they can't even get crashing and crash damage, which is - last time I checked - something that happens all the time when you're racing cars door to door.

3. Constant Internet connection required to save games.
This is really wrong, you're telling me that you couldn't make a game that can save your progress even if your offline and sync it the moment you get connection? What if someone doesn't want to participate in online play? As far as I know, that's the only reason you should need a constant connection. Other games manage this easily,  but apparently the people who made Gran Turismo have other things in mind.",-0.03414129729919203
2139,3.0,"Razer products have always been good to me, but this time I apparently received a lemon. When the keyboard arrived the box was undamaged, but several keycaps were coming off, but they were easy to put back on. The problem, and the reason I rate this keyboard as one star, is because the switch for the number 5 key on the number row was broken. It would not reset and remain within a hair of triggering, which makes it completely unusable for use with games in which the 5 key is tied to an action. I filed a return refund request with Amazon.

I am typing this on my previous keyboard, a Das Keyboard Professional with Cherry MX Blue switches, and I have to say that the ""feel"" of the Razer keyboard is more ""squishy"", perhaps as a result of the ""soft touch keys"". I am not a fan of the soft touch keys, and strongly prefer very stiff keys to prevent accidental presses. I am also very hard on keyboards, having broken several membrane and scissor boards in the past, and these keys are very easy to press, more akin to Cherry MX Black than Blue. The Cherry MX Blue and Razer Green switches are supposed to have the same actuation force, but the Razer keys are much easier to press, which can result in accidental key presses. It makes me wonder why Razer went through the time, effort, and expense to redesign the wheel, as it were, creating their own switches instead of using time tested, reliable Cherry MX Blue switches. The Razer keyboard is somewhat larger than a traditional keyboard because of the extra space at the bottom for the logo, which will take some time to getting used to if you are used to placing your wrist on the surface in front of the board.

The backlighting is nice, and you can design your own effects, but you cannot use the Starlight with any other pattern. For example, if you only want certain keys static lit (for instance, WSAD, or F and J) while the rest of the keys use the Starlight pattern, you cannot do that. The backlight strength is fully adjustable, and looks great if you set all of the keys to a low static level, say 25-50 (which is very bright as the human eye perceives green light very strong), and then layer a 255 brightness reactive and ripple/wave effect over it. All of this is configurable in the Razer Synapse software, which makes it easy to rebind keys as well.

If this keyboard had not arrived broken, I would rate it with 3 stars, -1 for the lack of full pattern backlight options, and -1 because this keyboard requires TWO USB ports to function correctly (one for the keyboard, one for the USB port), which is, to me, insane in this age of USB 3.0.

UPDATE: Razer has since released the direct mounted version, and I decided to give this version a chance. It arrived undamaged. The keys feel close to Cherry MX Blues, so it is quite nice to type on, and for heavy fingered people like me, it means that you won't accidentally press a key your finger rests on. The lighting effects are still nice, but without the backlight on the keycaps are basically blank, which means that combined with the default mode of ""breathing"", which doesn't change until you login. Starlight mode looks nice, but it is not random, it is a simple pattern which repeats. The secondary functions (#, $, "", etc) are still unlit, which is quite annoying, except on the number pad, which tells me there is no reason Razer couldn't have made the secondary functions illuminate over the rest of the board. There is no right side Windows key, instead it is replaced by the FN key which is useless 99.9999% of the time, and cannot be remapped to a Windows key.",0.03435977702581902

2143,3.0,"The Good: Superb visuals and audio, links with Metroid Fusion, lots of exploring, fun boss fights

The Bad: Doesn't evolve the formula, constant backtracking is tedious, lousy save system, funky controls, no multiplayer, getting 100% is nigh impossible without a FAQ

I could never really get into the Metroid series due to its lack of a decent story. While Samus Aran is a gaming pinnacle there's not much behind her besides she's an orphan raised by the Chozo race of Tallon IV. A ""Great Poison"" came to the planet from a meteor impact and ever since the Chozo had to flee their home world. Samus, being armed with Chozo armor and weapons, attempts to save the world from the Space Pirates and jellyfish...I mean Metroid. The game consists of five huge levels that you go back and forth from finding upgrades to your suit. There are a total of 4 weapons, 4 weapons upgrades, plus a few Morph Ball upgrades etc.

My favorite part of the game are the cool Morph Ball sections yet there aren't enough of them. You can, eventually, use the Spider Track Ball upgrade to click to ceilings and walls and there are some really cool segments for this yet only a few. You explore each level by needing to use a certain upgrade to get through such as a door needing a certain weapon to open it. You can also get missile expansion upgrades, power bomb upgrades, and energy tank (life) upgrades, but most of these are extremely hard to find and only die-hard Metroid fans will spend the time finding them. On the other hand there are tons of different enemy types and cool bosses. The game is just about exploring and now that it's in 3D Nintendo really makes you explore. The controls are ""dumbified"" for Nintendorks who were used to the 2D era and didn't know how to control an FPS so there is a lock on system (that is a bit annoying) and you use the L trigger to move your reticle. This can be really annoying for people used to standard FPS controls. You have to always stop to find out where to jump while enemies are attacking you. First hint: Nintendo this doesn't work! Secondly, there are a lot of different types of environments from water, to ice, to viney green lands.

Once you find your Gravita suit you can run through water with no problem so in turn you can explore more areas. After you get all of your add ons you have to find twelve artifacts to get to Metroid Prime. Basically, if you've played other Metroid games this is exactly like those except in 3D. I hated the constant backtracking and lousy save system. You will be in one level but the next add-on is two levels away. Instead of warping there you have to run through every single level and the enemy respawning doesn't help either. The best thing I liked about this game was the visuals. They look amazing for a launch title, and what's amazing are all the effects. Water and steam will hinder your vision, there will be static on-screen when your electronics are disrupted, Samus' face will reflect off her visor.

The sound, on the other hand, isn't so great with Ecco the Dolphin esque music and creepy techno. While some of it works it just sounds really old. There is also no multiplayer at all so this is another disappointment. You can link your Metroid Fusion GBA game for extra stuff, but I couldn't try that out. The game also sports the lamest endings ever (and I got the second best one). Overall, if you hated Metroid before you still will, and if you loved it before you'll love it more. Newcomers stay away if you don't like your FPS formula messed with. I don't hate Metroid I just wish it would evolve more.",0.00265678184188627

I'll give Sims 4 the realistic aspects of the Sims resembling the person playing or however you want it, plus the cool features of unlocking stuff and aspirations/traits. The Sims 4 reminds me of a more advanced version of the Sims 2. Although Sims 3 is much better hands down on certain features that are lacking in Sims 4, I wish not only they added the careers back in which you can actually see your Sim actually going to work, but I wish they kept removing the loading screen just like Sims 3, how it was so easy to view anything.",0.0678414491973814
2147,3.0,"I have played the ps2 version sometime after the release of this one. It was 9-10 years ago I don't remember much but what bothered me at the time was the limited customization and more focused on autosculpting. Now that the time has passed i realized i have too many 3rd person shooters and not many racers. I looked i to some games such as Juiced 2, midnight club LA, Need for speed undercover, Need for speed hot pursuit, Gran turismo 5, Ridge racer 7 amd Burnout paradise. Lets start with this game, so apperantly its a sequel to most wanted (which i haven't played) to start off the car handling is pretty nice and smooth. I will give them credit for this. Compared to underground and underground 2 the feeling is a bit different on the handling as if it did much better. The soun effects from the tires are okay but its only one main sound. The game failed to deliver on having a few cars in the game. Plenty of cars are missing that should have made it in the game but there are a few new cars that never made it until now. The soundtrack is absolutely the worst but thats okay if you turn off the music there will be a different soundtrack playing while racing which is a bit better than the games EA sountrack (all these EA sountracks suck) no you cannot play your custom music especially since this title was a laumch game for the ps3. As for graphics, this game being a launch title (early ps3 game) the graphics are pretty nice. Especially the cut scenes. There are some decent and a bit cheesey cut scenes. The gameplay is a bit differemt from past games. In this game you build a crew. Kinda like a street racing team. You then enter races around the city and every race you win you win territory and at the end you race the other teams boss. The game is simply put out. Other racers will block you as well as your crew will block them. The difficulty is pretty easy compared to undercover. Here its a bit easy to win races especially if you're using a crew member who is a blocker. You can only have one crew member in a race. The city is pretty decent size as its in 3 different sections. The cops in this game aren't so bas but you cant expect to lose them so easily. You need to distract them by causing some sort of mess (youll see in the game) so far I haven't ran into any major glitches. Overall the game is pretty decent although a bit rare to get because not only is this a early ps3 title but the game was originally a ps2 game. If anything people bought the ps2 version than the ps3 version. If you're looking for a street racing game where ypure familiar with others like midnight club or nfsu. You might enjoy this. Id say the game will take no more than 5 days to beat.

Update:
Well im almost near the end of the game. This is where the game becomes frusterating. Since the game lacks on having a lot of cars on the last city to take over all the cars are tier 3. While yours is tier 2. To unlock 3 mediocre tire 3 cars (Nissan skyline (tuner), Corvette (muscle), Lambo (exotic) you must use your tier 2 car against these faster cars. This is where you simply need luck to win. Its very impossible to win a speedtrap since the other cars horsepower is beyond faster than yours. This is where you need that lambo. Problem is at the beginnig of the game it asks which preference of cars you have. I have picked the tuners because the whole point of the game is to use tuners not muscle or exotic cars. There isn't that many to begin with. Using the lambo I noticed the car feels very stiff. Its fast but stiff. Its good agaist speedtrap races but not actual races. So now im stuck with the skyline which is a tiny bit faster than my tier 2 rx 7. While the handling is great. Its frusterating that I havemt even unlocked most parts for tier 3 still making me slower than the rest of the other cars who have a better performance and nos. I feel like the main challenge of the game is when you reach 68%. Overall the game is fine but the lack of cars and having to use tier 2 to use tier 3 cars is just a bit cruel.",0.0338958009885964
2148,3.0,"Mouse is great but has some issues.

1. Tracking issues: The mouse has a dual sensor laser. It's sensitive. If you get dirt or dust on your mouse pad, it gets on the laser. Use a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol and clean it once in a while.

2. Make sure mouse pad is free from things like dust and hair because the laser can pick it up.

3. This mouse doesn't work with some types of mouse pads. Mine doesn't like the hard plastic. Tried a $30 Corsair hard mouse pad and it sucked. My $4 junk pad works better. I've heard great reviews about the Razor Goliathus. I'll be getting one soon because people report this mouse working great on it and it's designed with dual lasers in mine.

4. I heard it doesn't like dark surfaces. However, my current pad is black and seems to work ok.

So keep the dust and hair out of the lens and have the right mouse pad.

Most customizable mouse ever. Change your palm rest and thumb rest so you can hit that sniper button (which is awesome). I have mine adjusted to 50%. Makes long range way easier.

Cons: only complaint I have is that the software takes some figuring out. But once you do, it's pretty cool. I set my thumb scroll wheel as volume controls and use it all the time.

Update: Still using the mouse but the tracking likes to jump around sometimes and now the middle mouse button is acting up. Not worth the price if it doesn't last very long. But for the most part it's not too bad. It's really only worth like $40-$50.",0.0490502981137656

2150,3.0,"After the breakthrough of Sims 2 seasons, I found bon voyage a bit of a let down. In order to really get to the action you need to gather your sims family and take them to one of several vacation destinations. There, your sim checks into a hotel and has a 'vacation.' He/she has several new 'wants' and 'desires.' (Including the desire to pick up the local lingo, go on a tour, etc).  While I had plenty of simolians to take my sims for a lengthy vacation, one of the things that irks me in retrospect, is that it requires a reasonable amount of dough for your sim to have a good time. (I don't cheat, so  I have my characters work for their money). Second, it has a few bugs. For example, my sims starved in the local restaurant waiting for their dinners.

I do like the beachfront animation, the fact the sims can swim in the water, and the new properties where you can make your own store and other structures.

I found some of the tours to be silly... My sims were going on a tour, saw a giant camera, and when they dived down to touch it they got... Water lice? Ummm.... Okay. Who thought that up? Lame.

 The hair on wrestlers with long hair (Kane, Y2J, Lita...) are just joke!  They look 2D and seem out of place from the rest of the body.  The characters themseleves look close enough to the real person.  The character animation is good.......P>The controls take awhile to get used to.  I prefer fighting in one on one battles instead of fighing more people because it's really hard to fight more than one person.  It's hard to tell who you're locked on to and you may just end up fighting the ref.
The story mode is a joke!  You fight 3 or 4 matches before it ends.  Some story!  You get a little branching paths to deside which belt you want but they're all basically the same.  The only reason you would want to keep playing it is to unlock the secret items. ...
There are a lot of matches in the game.  Tag, royal rumble, hell in the cell, TLC, iron man, i quit, etc.  This is the part you would probebly play the most.  It's funner to just  play those matches instead of the story mode.
The last thing in this game is the Create a Superstar mode.  You can unlock extra things from the story mode to add to your character.
For my final say, this game is just fun to play with your friends or once in awhile.  It gets boring quick.  In order to improve this game, they need to make the story mode much BETTER and LONGER.  The WWF type storylines you see on tv are NO WHERE to be found in this game.  I was hoping you would get to go to all the PPVs and shows.

I used the hint button a few times but never needed to consult the strategy guide.

2153,3.0,"When my brother's friend came over with this game, I didn't feel that this was a game to like, as I am not really interested in American military tactics. I know that is very unique in it's originality and presentation. But I never really fell in love with this game, even with all the hype that it had received before it's release, I don't like this game. Maybe it has to do with my strong disagreement with the war in Iraq, maybe it has to do with the mass influx of military games coming out since 9/11. Maybe it's the way they show Arabs as nothing more than terrorists, Maybe something else, but if it had come out 3 years ago, then it would've been a smash it to me, but it came with real bad timing in the video game release spectrum.
Pros: 1. A very unique game in terms of play
2. Good voice acting
3. Frequent speech by soldiers (keeps you interested)
4. Free the peoples of Zekistan from the almighty clutch of dictator Mohammed Al-Afad
5. Solid Training mode (really helped me learn the aspects of the game)
Cons: 1. Xbox Live play is severly limited (just co-op. nothing else)
2. Soldiers always miss the Zekes when their upper body is just sticking out there, I mean, you can fire at him from 50 feet away and you'll still miss (no hits at all, zoom in and you'll see)
3. Play is mostly repetitive (have one team divert the terrorist while the other team snakes around him and fires at him)
4. I would've expected the Zekes to be more in groups instead of being just one or two Zekes per sector.
5. More swearing in this game than a South Park episode (well, maybe not a South Park episode, but there is a lot of swearing in this game)
6. Why do all terrorists have to be Arabic? Hasn't anyone heard of the Tamil separatists in Sri Lanka? or even the Northern Ireland secession in Ireland? Terrorists are not only Arabs, you see.
7. Reminds me of a similar kind of escapade in some country I know of.
8. Never really got into the story and it's purpose (there is a mass grave in Chapter 5, but I felt nothing when I saw it)
9. Just too many military games coming out (WWII games and Tom Clancy games, anyone?)
FINAL VERDICT:  I most likely think different than most of you, but I am getting very suspicious of the many games coming out that have to deal with the US Army and World War II.

2156,3.0,"I can still remember the final battle of the original Command and Conquer from back in the '90's.  What I thought would take a few hours ended up taking an entire evening.  Defeating those wicked NOD guys was the most mind-numbing experience ever - I could still feel my brain pounding long after the final cutscene played.  Getting up for work the next day was almost as difficult!
So, of course when Westwood announced they were going to make a first-person shooter based on C&C, I had to get it.  I can tell you C&C Renegade is a worthy first attempt yet it does fall short compared to the current crop of shooters out now.
PROS:
1. Graphics - I'm surprised at other reviewer's complaints.  Not the best in terms of detail or graphic quality, but still very good for a game of this size and scope.
2. Action - Very engaging.  It's not a one-man show - you're usually thrown into the heat of battle with explosions all around you.  Plus you get to drive a lot of the vehicles too.
3. C&C Theme - all the goodies, GDI Cannons, Tiberium Harvesters, Obelisks, etc...  The sound effects are very reminiscent of the early games, it even keeps track of the number of NOD soldiers you squish in your mammoth tank.
4. Cutscenes - very cool.  Just when I think Westwood is slacking towards the later levels they throw in a nice epic movie to watch between levels.
5. Music - Awesome!! (as always)  C&C games still have the best soundtracks.
NEUTRAL:
1. Level Design - Yeah, it's Westwood's first foray into level design and it shows.  But quite frankly it shows just how accustomed gamers have gotten to having everything linear; we expect to follow a straight line to the goal and never have to backtrack once!  At least in this game you can pretend this would be more like a real world assault.  Besides, we're doing everything from beach assaults to desert sieges to sneak attacks in cities, submarines and snow covered mountain bases.  What's wrong with that?
2. Voice Acting - Decent.  Our hero Major Havoc sounds more like Duke Nukem.  ""You're going up against a whole squadron by yourself?""  ""Yeah, doesn't seem fair does it?  Maybe I'll shoot left-handed.""  Am I the only one who gets a little creeped out by the way they move their lips?
3. Weapons - All nicely balanced with the exception of the grenade launcher.  This worthless weapon makes huge explosions that seem to leave the enemy unfazed most of the time.  Is this thing on?
CONS:
1. Load Times - Ugh.  Over 2 min to load a level!  If you're killed or even if you restart the same level it takes just as long!  It's so annoying you'll end up playing the easier difficulty settings just to avoid dying.  Minus one star for this annoyance.
2. Enemy AI - Atrocious! As much as I'd like to be biased I have to admit this is one of the worst ever.  I can round a corner, see someone crouched behind a box, pump about ten rounds into him and while I stop to reload, he goes back to crouching behind the box... uhhh hello?  I'll pick off someone with my sniper rifle and the guy next to him will just stand there and wait for his turn.  I smirk when I'm warned of ""elite"" enemy forces approaching as these high-caliber opponents basically run into my line of fire and take maybe a few more hits to kill.  Doom had better AI.  Minus one star for this (and that's being nice!)
3. System Requirements - Considering a game like Wolfenstein runs on my system without a hitch, I'm disappointed I have to minimize all the detail settings using my (fairly new) Geforce 2 Pro and even then the frame rates choppy.  You're gonna need a 1.4 gig system and a GF3 at the very least to run this game smoothly.
To sum it up - C&C fans (with sufficient hardware) will find enough to overlook the rather major annoyances in the game.  Hardcore action fans, however, will find plenty to nitpick about but may realize that, in spite of it all, it's still a really fun game to play.

The strength training is worthless and the balance games are fun for a week. I like the yoga because I live out in the sticks and have no access to a yoga center.

It has come in really handy as an accurate scale, though, and Shaun White Snowboarding was a lot of fun on the board, so I guess my low rating is just for Wii Fit and not the balance board.

2158,3.0,"Once I learned that some of Diablo III's PC woes (i.e. loot drops, auction house) had been remedied for this port, I decided to check it out. After owning the game for a few months and trying repeatedly to enjoy it, I finally admitted to myself the game feels dated and uninspired. It looks and plays like it was released in 2003, which should come as no surprise considering development began in 2001. The endless development period and shifting focus during production have left this game feeling out of time and without any concrete identity. Although it is still fun to play for a few hours, I can't help but feel disappointed. Here are my complaints, from smallest to greatest:

1. Static camera angle
You cannot move the camera in this game. No rotation, no zoom. Even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Champions-of-Norrath/dp/B0000CDZBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Champions of Norrath</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baldur-s-Gate-Dark-Alliance/dp/B00005Q8IR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance</a>&nbsp;had a movable camera, and those games came out a decade ago. The fixed camera puts Diablo III in the same low-budget space as modern hack 'n' slashers R.A.W. (Realms of War) and Crimson Alliance on the 360.

2. Lack of enemy diversity
Hacking through the same exact zombie model for the 400th time in the first hour of gameplay is a sure sign of things to come, and the visual repetition becomes dull fast.

3. Bland environments
Diablo III isn't a bad looking game, but it isn't very good, either. Some environments, like the fortress, look like they were pulled directly from a GameCube game, and I'm not exaggerating. (Again, blame the lengthy development period.) The only redeeming visual aspect of Diablo III is the variety of armor and weapons, though the inability to zoom in makes it difficult to enjoy your hard-earned loot while you're on the battlefield.

4. Random dungeon layouts
Random dungeons seemed like a great idea a decade ago, but players and developers quickly realized that instead of creating diversity and replay value, random dungeons actually make everything look exactly the same. Unfortunately, Blizzard missed the memo, and each area of Diablo III has dungeons comprised of about 10 stock pieces. This means you run through the same rooms, same hallways, and same staircases again and again. And then again. Even worse, everything is laid out at right angles, which means you run down a straight corridor, turn left or right, run down a straight corridor, turn left or right...then take a nap.

5. Mindless battles
It's hard for me to say it, but the battle system actually grows tedious. I love this type of game, and typically reject criticisms regarding simple gameplay and mindless hack 'n' slash action, but this game wears thin fast. Lower difficulties are easy enough to put you to sleep, but increasing the difficulty just means you repeat the same evasive moves and attacks 10 more times to kill each enemy, which ramps up the repetition until it is just about unbearable. Coupled with the low number of enemy models and behaviors, playing the hard difficulties is the video game equivalent of treading water.

6. Zero character customization
The real gamebreaker for me is that Blizzard eliminated ALL character customization and building from the game. You level up, and that's it. Not an attribute point or skill point in sight. Every once in a while you choose a new attack or passive skill and a modification for it, but you can swap these out at any time. All decision-making processes involving your character are gone, and without the risk of allocating points there is zero reward or sense of progress for me. It severs the attachment I have to my character, and destroys any impetus I might have to play through the game with the same character more than once. The base character is EXACTLY the same every time you play.

So, the game is ten years too late. But it also feels like Blizzard shot for the largest part of the bell curve with this one. By that, I mean they served up an on-rails action RPG with straightforward character leveling and an uncomplicated battle system that is accessible to anyone, regardless of age or experience. There's a place for that, and I honestly have had some good times playing this game with my girlfriend for that very reason. However, Diablo III holds the promise of extensive re-playability thanks to its massive loot piles and multiple difficulty levels, but the blandness of the overall product can't compel me to grind through it more than once or twice. It is, at best, something to do while I'm drinking and hanging out with friends. Diablo III doesn't offer anything more than Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diablo-2/dp/B00002CF9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diablo 2</a>&nbsp;did over a decade ago, and it pales in comparison to some modern action RPGs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sacred-2-Fallen-Angel/dp/B001BTPRKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sacred 2: Fallen Angel</a>.

2159,3.0,"This game has awesome chess sets. Upgrading to Chessmaster 11 compared to version 10 is just about the same thing, except that everything is on 1 DVD and you don't need to have the DVD in the tray to run chessmaster. The problem with this game is that in ELO rated games, the computer opponent delays. It can take 15 minutes in some moves, which is an unnecessary wait considering you're playing a computer opponent with an average joe ELO. This wait is to make the opponent ""human"", but no thanks, I don't wanna wait. Also, after the time runs out, you lose the game and it stops. In the Fritz chess program, the game changes from rated to unrated when times run out rather than stopping and labeling the game as a ""lost"". The PSP version is different, it plays quickly and allows ELO rated games with no time, so get it on the PSP. It's a shame, because this game looks pretty nice compared to Fritz, but the constraints are a deal breaker.

The game play was solid. I was never bored with sucking up ghost. The way they would keep things fresh by continually throwing out new kinds of ghosts was cool.

The only problem I had with the game is the lack of a save anywhere. I can't stand games that don't respect my time.  There were two or three points in the game that I had trouble with that would have been easy if I could save anywhere instead of starting the level over.  This one thing made a pleasant game into a tedious exercise at times.  I honestly wouldn't have bought the game if I known I had to restart the level if I died on a boss level.  There is one boss level that I think is defeated more by random chance than skill. The fight is kind of long.

2169,3.0,"""Drakengard"" is what happens when you take ""Draken: The Ancients' Gates,"" mix it liberally with ""Dynasty Warriors"" and ""Panzer Dragoon,"" and throw in an anmie copy of the plot for the film ""Dragonheart."" It offers a fun diversion in short spurts, but gulp down too much at a time and you're sure to be hit by the numbing repetition of it all.
You're cast as Caim, a wounded hero who makes a pact with a wounded dragon and ultimately sets out to rescue his sister, the goddess Furiae. Does that mean Caim is a god himself? Apparently not. And who captured Furiae? A nameless Empire with secret intentions that ultimately translate into ""ruling the world."" Some other characters come into the mix, but few of them (despite their extensive biographies in the instruction manual) play into the events of the game in any way that justifies their inclusion. In other words, if you're seeking a game with a good story, ""Drakengard"" is perhaps the last place you should look. Despite this, it doggedly attempts to tell a story in long, painfully written cut-scenes that ultimately prove incoherent. At least the rendered movies make for some spectacular eye candy, even if they fail to shed any light on the unintelligible plot. The opening cinematic is sure to fire your blood and whet your appetite for the game that follows...
...And the game that follows starts out at a rapid clip, thrusting you into the thick of a siege. You'll wonder almost immediately why you're the only warrior fighting against the Empire even as beleaguered (and apparently invisible) soldiers cry out for assistance. For a game that wants so desperately to stick you square in the middle of a battle royale fantasy style, the lack of allies is a glaring omission. Even if battling comrades were nothing save window dressing, it would have helped to immerse you. As it stands, the action is still furious and fairly engaging. Blood spurts are satisfying, but more so the way your weapons send your enemies soaring in waves (like Sauron in the opening of Peter Jackson's take on ""The Fellowship of the Ring""). You only have a few moves at your disposal, so like everything in ""Drakengard"" it eventually wears thin, but it's good fun for a while.
The monotony of ground combat is broken up by... well, the monotony of aerial combat. This is, in my opinion, the weakest aspect of the game. Caim battles a host of foes from astride his fire-breathing dragon, but the dragon's limited abilities and some poor camera work ultimately weaken the experience. On top of that, the enemies displayed in this mode make no logical sense. It's hard to get excited about frying giant bats and winged chests-of-drawers with the same molten breath over and over and over again. Boss battles, at least, liven things up - and all of them take place in the sky.
""Drakengard"" claims to be an RPG, but there's no actual roleplaying. The stats included are useless and amount to nothing, which is just fine since this is clearly an action game - but why the false claims? I don't know. Ignore them. ""Drakengard"" is as deep as kiddy pool, but it's good for a splash every now and again. Missions objectives are never diverse enough to make one mission feel any different from the last. The scenery changes, but the graphics (all but the main character models) are bland as dirty dishwater, and scenery ""pop in"" is a noticeable (and laughable) issue. The game's soundtrack is certainly different, but it tends to perfectly mimic a cat being repeatedly slammed against a pole while Gregorian monks chant in the background. This is not helped by the constant babbling of your ""companions,"" who consistently spout misplaced and distracting anti-wisdom when you'd rather focus on the task at hand.
All in all, it's worth playing if you don't ask too much from your gaming - but wait until it goes down in price before you invest.

2170,3.0,"While the game itself is quite good.  I enjoy playing my copy of the game, and still find new interest and challenges of running cities.  The replay value should be obvious as there is no ""end goal"" to meet, though there are ""rewards"" along the way.  There are several problems, however, particularly when compared to Sim City 2000.  First, there are no scenarios.  That is a pity because the scenarios often enhanced the value of the game.  Second, you cannot for your own landform in the New City mode before you start the game (again, unlike SC2000).  Both of these problems were later corrected for the later cousin of the game: Sim City 3000 Unlimited. Additionally, the online support is much better for Unlimited.  The building downloads on the official website are minimal, and the building design tool is not supported by the basic game.  Still, I will have to admit that 3000 is still a vast improvement over the previous version.  The buildings are better designed, and they really do look different on different sides.  Also, the graphics are much better over 2000, while they are not vastly improved in Unlimited (which is essentially the same game, with the additions above AND additional buildings).  I would recommend that you do buy Unlimited over this version simply because of the vast number of updates.  And, with the release of Sim City 4, it is highly unlikely that even the Unlimited website will stay up much into the future, and it certainly will not be supported any more.",0.05768655406212787

2178,3.0,"Okay, let's start off by saying that VR is the real deal. I didn't think it was going to be, but it is. But does it really have to be this convoluted? I looked at the box and I was immediately taken aback by how much it looks like a premium product. The packaging is stellar, and it really brings home the idea that this is really next-gen technology. Then, I opened the box, and I saw the wires. Wires after wires after wires. So many damn wires. Why are there so many wires? I thought true next gen technology was supposed to be wireless, but this contraption is so connected to the PS4 as to look like a symbiotic parasite. Seriously, let me break it down for you;

1. There is a wire to connect the processor unit to the TV.
2. Then the wire to connect the PS4 to the processor unit.
3. The wire to connect the PlayStation camera.
4. Connect the PS4 processor Unit to the front of the PS4 via USB.
5. Connect AC power cord.
6. The VR headset connection cable.
7. The VR headset connects to the VR headset connection cable.
8. The Stereo Headphones connect to the inline remote for the VR headset.

That's 8 freaking heavy duty wires. Count them; 8! By the time you are finished, your PS4 looks like it's connecting into the Matrix. It should not be this complicated. Why aren't there headphones in the headset itself? Why do you need so many separate cables when 2 would have sufficed? If you worry about fire hazards, you are really going to have a horrible time. It took me 30 minutes to connect everything, and then it gets worse when the system forces you to download an update, then another update for the demo disc. I mean, it's just not user friendly. To get the full experience, you need the Camera, 2 damn Maracas, and the Headset. Right there, I would have said, ""I'm out!"". Luckily, the experience itself was so freaking amazing, it almost made up for the convoluted mess that is laying on my living room floor. Luckily, the headset is light and comfortable, for the most part, until you start to sweat. Then condensation makes the lenses fog up, and you have to constantly keep wiping them in order to properly see anything.

Overall, if you are curious as to what this thing is capable of, go to a store and check out a demo unit and make your decision there. Don't wait until you get home to have all to set this thing up blindly. You will not have a good time, and it will negate all of the benefits of the experience.

  But the number one gripe i have about this game  is ..  drum roll please!........YOU CANT PLAY AS VENOM !!!!  ( you HAVE to  play  thru the whole game+side missions as spidey  and THEN  FINALLY, you can unlock venom.. which i thought  was misleading..they even have it in Small print in the first few pages of the manual..how  Sneaky is that?)

 all that aside  its fun to play as venom ! and spidey as well..  But  if you really want a good spider man game?  check out  activisions  spider-man the movie game... or the spider-man 2 games. you won't regret it  they  look a hundred times  better, have much better music, and the gameplay is top notch!

over all  here ate the pros and cons...

 Pros..the stan lee interview is great(its always nice to hear stan lee talk about spidey and marvel)

 great comick book feel/ good graphics

the G4 making of the game special..

the included comic book ..but if your like me  u have the""real"" issues already so you know the venom story:)  although  i like  how they reinvented the ""ultimate"" venom saga in wich the black costume/bio suit  actually being a attempt to cure cancer..the original venom ""origin""  is MUCH better with the alien symbiote costume(from  the secret wars series) and eddie brock as a disgrunted photog for the bugle...who is out to get peter parker..

 swinging around new york (although its not as open as the movie games)

Cons..

YOU CANT PLAY AS VENOM  (unless you complete the whole game first then he is ""unlockable"" ...which is very misleading to the consumer..its even in small print inside the manual..thats a rip off to the fans that want to play as venom right away...the way this game was advertises..depending on who you chose to play it will be a great time~) this game is just filler material  until  the  spider man 3 movie game comes along  :)  which we all know venom will be in the third movie  which will rock !!.. but topher grace as eddie brock/venom??  i don't know about that one .. thats another review  for later :)

 voice acting is..poor..peter sounds like a whiney brat sometimes  and don't get me started on the  dopey sounding human  torch.. but venom in my opinion is the star of the show here  ...

bottom line  its a fun game. don't get me wrong,..but a real let down it could have been MUCH better.. and thats why its also  out in a special verson  to dress it up and sell more copies  but if u have to have this game the"" special version ""is the way to go....let the buyer beware though  there are BETTER  spider man games out there.. im a huge spider- man fan  and i feel that this game could have been a better homage to a legendary  character than this all fuff and no substance marketing gimmick.. ill be returning mine today.. hmm then again i can always put it up on ebay...somebody will buy it...",0.030350735599881468

2184,3.0,"It's sad that to this day, Nintendo has yet to release a quality Pokmon game on a non-handheld console. Pokmon Battle Revolution for the Wii isn't much of an exception, but it doesn't deserve the bad rep it's been commonly given among fans and critics alike. It is indeed a fairly straightforward game; you upload your Pokmon from Diamond, Pearl or Platinum and send them into battle online against various worldwide competitors in a more vivid 3D setting. So essentially, it's a pure Pokmon battle game with improved graphics. If you don't own Pokmon Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, your options are severely limited; you will only have access to `Rental' Pokmon with varying movesets and stats, which in general will set players at a great disadvantage in the competitive online atmosphere. But that was never PBR's purpose to begin with, clearly. It essentially works like an expansion pack to the DS games, and should not be used otherwise. In short: if you don't own at least one of the DS versions of the game, don't buy Battle Revolution. But if you do, it's a great addition to the Pokmon universe, and an exciting new way to compete. At the game's beginning, you're invited to Poktopia, a place filled with colosseums and stadiums to, you guessed it, stage Pokmon battles. Players are allowed to design and customize their own character, and although options are slim early on, as you progress through the game you'll have access to various outfits, gear, and hairstyles to doll up your personalized trainer. From there, you may upload each and every Pokmon  stored in your DS game (including those in the PC boxes) to Battle Revolution. PBR makes a `copy' of each Pokmon  so that you may organize and customize them as you like to form different teams for use in both the 1-Player mode and online battling, all without having to connect to the DS again (unless you require further update to your squad, in which case you may easily reload to the Wii from PBR's main menu). The 1-Player mode may come as a disappointment to those who played XD or Colosseum; there is no storyline and no actual RPG activity; it's pure battling. Each stage has different rules and restrictions, but for the majority of them, you'll be able to use your own Pokmon . There are a handful that require you to use Rental Pokmon , and ironically, these end up being the most difficult. There's also a wonky `mixer' mode in which you and your CPU opponent select teammates randomly among all of your combined Pokmon . A tip for this particular stage: don't bring in any powerhouses, because you may end up destroying yourself with them. This may sound simple and nothing new, but PBR has some nice assets to bring to the table. There's actually a much greater amount of strategy involved in the more advanced 1-Player battles, and less of the repetitive physical onslaught and straightforward weakness exploitation seen repeatedly in the DS games. Some of the unique double battle combos in particular may inspire some players to form some new teams (and strategies) of their own. Because of this, of course, some of the later battles can get much more intense than those found in the DS games, so those unsatisfied with the difficulty level of the battles found there may find PBR to be particularly worthwhile. One setback, however, is that this can occasionally be due to the endless slew of stat and status-altering moves most of the CPU opponents tend to be armed with, which oftentimes leaves them open to being Taunted into oblivion. Battle Revolution operates very similarly to the DS games, and most functions of items, abilities and attacks remain the same. Occasionally, however, PBR shows glimpses of difference, and attacks, items or abilities will activate or fail when they ordinarily wouldn't in the DS game. The online mode is PBR's big draw, however, and rightfully so-it allows players to battle other trainers anywhere, anytime, and although it was the Wii's first venture into online competing, it is, for the most part, a pretty satisfying one. Lag is generally pretty minimal unless you're up against someone with a particularly weak connection, and you have the option of obtaining the opponent's Battle Pass (an informational card with a list of their Trainer name, team Pokmon and accompanying movesets and stats) after the battle-but don't worry parents, absolutely no personal information is shared. The difficulty ranges from intensely competitive to overwhelmingly simple, as with most online competing. One of the biggest gripes here is that unfortunately, an enormous percentage of players have gotten into the tiring habit of forming teams upon teams of nothing but overused legendaries, so be prepared to fight hundreds of Palkia, Dialga and Giratina. This can become obnoxious quickly, but when you come across thoughtfully organized, deeply strategic teams, it's almost always a great video game thrill. PBR's graphics are great, and about as good as Nintendo's gotten in terms of really bringing the world of Pokmon to life. It's not a massive improvement from XD, but the bright colors and vivid animations help keep things aesthetically appealing, even while you're making move selections (or waiting for an opponent to do the same). The final in-game goodie PBR brings to Pokmon fans is the abundance of rare items, which become purchasable as you progress through the 1-Player mode and may be sent to your DS game. Players can gain access to various berries, hold items and TMs (some of which can only be obtained once in the DS game, such as Dark Pulse and Overheat), as well as some rare Pokmon including but not limited to a Surfing Pikachu and an Electivire. These additional gifts make the 1-Player mode particularly worthwhile, and can of course really help beef up your team(s). Overall, Pokmon Battle Revolution isn't as satisfying as it could have been, but it's a great expansion to the Pokmon games and a near-necessity to players who hunger to compete online without the hassle and limitations of the DS's online modes.",0.01402087261061328

Also, the battle voices get pretty annoying after a short while.

That's a great feature that more RPGs should have.  The ENDING, however is a total mess and will almost make you sorry you played the game at all.",0.020582502006650613

2189,3.0,"Mortal comba... *ahem* Mortal KOMBAT (no letter c in earthrealm) vs DC universe is an interesting combo.

it's an overly violent game that isn't allowed to be overly violent, it has characters who would rip out your spine and feed it to you through whats left of your face, who are now fighting against heroes who, for the most part, swore never to kill and to uphold justice (villains don't count they HAVE to kill)
(this is a hint that these two universes don't go together.)
on top of this, the ENTIRE game (button combos, environments, graphics) are all just slightly better carry-overs from Mortal comb...(dammit) *ahem* Mortal Kombat: Armageddon on the ps2. I am not kidding, even the last boss is a reskined Blaze (i am not kidding, watch one youtube of blaze and one of ""Darkahn"" exactly the same).

+all the main characters that are expected are here (scorpion, Batman, Joker, wonderwoman, Baraka, Jax, Kano,  Kitana, Liu Kang, Raiden, Catwoman, Darkseid, Flash, Green Lantern, Joker, Lex Luthor and some other dc heros)
+the story in this game is actually cohesive and you can actually follow it.
+ the DC heroes move lists are easy to remember and execute and match up fairly to Kombat characters.(it's not easy writing new moves)

-being a fan of Mortal Kombat, this game looks and feels like a modified copy of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.
-It is awkward that they have to essentially write random yellow ""rage"" magic so they can justify making the DC characters be able to kill (remember, oath of justice)
- the final boss is disappointing, and the final cutscene following your victory is just as disappointing and hollow as the boss.

The controls are unresponsive - adjusting sensitivity seems to make no difference - and this is REALLY annoying. I could live with the rest of the problems - almost all FPS games have AI, graphics, story, etc, problems. But the poor controls make the game really frustrating at times.

2194,3.0,"Mass Effect:  Andromeda is a difficult game to categorize.  I had avoided spoilers prior to release so had almost no expectations and certainly no awareness of the controversies about some of its designers and its ham-fisted blundering in the social media space.  So I came to this game almost as free of bias as one can get these days.  In short, some parts of ME:A are as good as anything I've experienced in the series.  And some are far worse.

Positives:  Level design is often creative and involves clever three dimensional puzzles and loot finding.  If you enjoy scavenging, you are often rewarded by loot chests hidden well off the beaten path.  The open world areas are also typically true to form, and in fact can change over time as your alterations to the environment allow you to enter previously irradiated or hazardous areas.  Improvements to the land rover dramatically increase its initial handling, and you and your combat team will similarly increase in power and showy effectiveness as your skills and gear improve.  Trying the multiplayer missions is also a great way to practice your combat skills early as well as become familiar with many of the game's enemies, and you can earn gear and loot that carries over into the single player mode.

Negatives:  The character graphics are as bad as you've heard.  Maybe even worse.  Most planets and zones are fine, but non-combat areas where you have to do a lot of talking are poor.  Facial expressions vary from vacant to idiotic, and are worse than what you'd see on games from 10 years ago.  I recently played Borderlands 2 on the PS4 and random NPCs in Sanctuary actually have better voice-mouth movement calibrations than in Andromeda.  There are tons of basic character movement errors like running nearly sideways while going up stairs, getting stuck in random objects, and people that seem to shatter their own spines when turning around to talk to you.  Nobody blinks.  I have a clip of 6 npcs staring at my character in which nobody blinks, ever.  It is genuinely creepy.

Unfortunately, combat is also often glitchy and frustrating.  Enemies can hit you through solid ""cover,"" and often use moves that are broken.  One of the worst occurs in multiplayer in which certain ""mini-boss"" style monsters can one hit you through walls or from some distance away, instantly killing you with no possibility of revive and usually ruining the mission.  You have to learn what the windup on those moves looks like and jump away if they start to us it, even if they are in a different room and not even facing your direction.  Otherwise you die.  Weapons are also often unpredictable, in a way that makes it hard to know if they are coded that way or buggy.  Sniper rifles often fire low, particularly if the target is in cover, and shotguns often send pellets everywhere but at the target.  Grenades bounce off walls and fall through the floor or go sailing up into space.  Multiplayer also allows you to send NPC ""strike teams"" on missions that run while you are doing something else or offline, but these are likewise glitchy.  Teams routinely fail missions with 90%+ success likelihoods -- my record is a level 20 team using the best gear that failed four (4) 94% success rate missions in a row -- which gave them permanent negative traits.  Truly stupid.

The ultimate impression I have is that the game was broken up into different development areas by the designers.  Some coding teams did their parts of the game extremely well, and others were terrible and seemingly didn't even beta test their own work.  If you can stick to the areas that the competent programmers worked on, and ignore the places the B team was involved, you can enjoy this game.

Well, I can saw without much fear of contradiction it's not on par with the Transformers game with the minicons from a few years prior.  However, that doesn't mean it's awful.  It plays sort of along the lines of Spider-man 2 or another ""sandbox"" style game.  It's a little short, but nice to be able to play as either the Autobots or the Decepticons.  Though, the bad guys had the plus of being actively engaged in destroying the terrain.

The two major problems I had were the driving being a bit unruly with a controller and the aiming being a little bit wonky.  I'd sometimes find it hard to lock on to an enemy.  The driving I got used to for the most part, but it still felt a little clunky with random objects bringing me to a halt while I could just plough through most anything on the road.

2198,3.0,"If Baldur's Gate and Gauntlet had a baby, this game would be it. It inherits everything about those two games that made them popular. Unfortunately, it also inherits almost all of their flaws as well.
Heroes makes no attempt at being a serious action RPG. There's barely any story to speak of. There is a big bad guy who's gonna conquer the world and it's up to 1-4 player heroes to stop him through several fantastic realms. In this aspect it's just like Gauntlet.
Players of Baldur's Gate will recognize the interface and character abilities as much of it is ripped straight from that game. Some of the abilities are exactly the same. The inventory, the way items work/equip, abilities, and attributes are pretty much a carbon copy of Baldur's Gate. This isn't such a bad thing, and the developers have streamlined things to make them work in a more fast paced environment better without slowing the pace of the game and interfering with your three co-op buddies playing with you. In fact, I think Bioware could take some cues from D&D: Heroes in how it improved the play.
Make no mistake, the whole point of this game is to sit down with some friends and hack your way through various levels and improve your character with upgraded powers and abilities as well as new and more powerful items and equipment. Hardcore stories are meant for a single player experience. So the combining of two such games as Baldur's Gate and Gauntlet seems like a perfect combination for such a concept. However, it seems that developers keep ignoring the king of multiplayer action/RPGs, Diablo. More importantly, they ignore the facets that made that game such an immense success in it's genre.
Heroes is fun. It's even fun playing through by yourself (but you really want to get this to play multi). However, after you play through it, it doesn't hold a great deal of replay value. Diablo introduced things that kept that game replayable for literally years.
1. Randomized levels that are different everytime you play.
2. Seemingly endless variety of magical weapons with near infinate power combinations so there is always something better to find.
3. The ability to take your existing character through the game two more times in succeeding difficulties.
4. Extremely high level cap for your character so that you could play with him for a long time.
It's nearing almost a decade and still virtually no games of this type implement even one of these concepts. Had Heroes included them it could easily have been a five star game. As it is, it isn't a bad game by any means, but it does suffer from blandness. I could live with the fact that it doesn't really introduce anything new, but not capitalizing on winning concepts is a shame.

I wonder if they included features here intentionally so as to justify an ""expansion pack"" or if they were really pushed up against a time frame and simply decided to wait until this release to include the Random Map Generator and the other (albeit minor) features.

I do appreciate the new artifacts and abilities because they enable me to make better customized maps (in my humble opinion).  The dwarves are pretty cool to play with and the campaigns are alright.

Overall this expansion is kind of typical of what you'd expect nowadays.  Basically, the game producers hold off with some nice features and release them separate from the base game.  Monetarily speaking, in this case, the base game will cost you about $30 and the expansion will be another $30.  For $60 you bought a pretty cool game, but I still think it is too expensive.  This, however, is the norm nowadays.

The Heroes V game is a great upgrade in the series, only I would price this first expansion pack around $15 to be fair.  But then again, everything costs what consumers are willing to pay for them.

To close, if you love Heroes V, this expansion won't be coming down in price any time soon, so you might as well decide HOW MUCH you love the base title.  I would think this pack would delight the diehards more than anybody else, especially those who enjoy the customization more than the installation-provided scenarios.  The Random Map Generator turned out to be a great product, and the added items, etc. make you want to be more creative and use more of the game's new tools.

EDIT:

Well, I feel like an old-timer - that initial review was written eight years ago!

Anyway, I will say now in 2014 that HOMM5 is the last good HOMM title - HOMM6 is not very good at all; a true disappointment.

Also, this review was written before I stumbled upon Tribes of the East (ToTE).  I was really upset when I did that, by the way, because ToTE is the ""complete edition"" of HOMM, yet Ubisoft (a shoddy French game company) doesn't want you to know that.  With ToTE, you get a completely expanded HOMM5 franchise in one stand-alone product: you get the base game, the Dwarves, and also the third optional tier of characters... all in one.  The base game and the Dwarves expansion are now useless.  Of course, the Dwarves expansion pack (Hammers of Fate) provides something like 3 custom maps with it.  My guess, as I have not checked (since I stupidly trusted Ubisoft not to screw me and I bought Hammers of Fate), is that you can find these few custom maps online for free.

So yeah, if you really want HOMM5 (because HOMM6 is terrible), then just get the ToTE version.  Also, double-check Steam and compare to Amazon's prices.  I noticed that ""The Heroes Pack"" on Steam is $20 (not a sales price) as of this date (which also includes a separate title: Dark Messiah, which is a first-person adventure game), though again you only need ToTE - which is $10 without a sale.  If you wait for these to go on sale, you could get ToTE for between $2.50 and $5.00, which is what I now recommend.

Lastly, in my humble opinion, HOMM3 and HOMM4 are the best titles in the franchise.  My advice is to avoid Ubisoft like the plague - European countries don't know how to treat people right; stick with the Americans: they don't outwardly bamboozle you (exception: Electronic Arts).",0.03425945434045081
2204,3.0,"This is one of those products that seems to fit a need, until you realize the number of faults that the overall design of the unit itself has.

Anyone who had an Xbox 360 knows about overheating issues. They happened fairly often and at times the results were bad, very bad. The Xbox One is designed to have better cooling, air flow, etc - but Antec is playing off of past generation concerns here. That's not entirely bad, a cooler console is never really a bad thing.

Set up is easy, it comes with a 4"" USB cable, rests on top of the Xbox One and plugs into the back USB port for power. Easy peezie to set up. There are even little rubber soles to prevent the unit from scratching the actual console.

Now the not so good stuff.

First off if you can not look down at your console, you will have a difficult time reading the temp as it is displayed ontop of the actual unit.

Second, it blows the hot air out the back of the unit. Depending on where you have your console set up, and what type of entertainment center you have, this could cause your console to suck back in that warm air and have very little positive effect.

Third, the unit itself is not secure. It is merely resting on the console so any type of brushing against it has the chance to move it and push it off.

Forth, there is no way to manually turn it on/off. It turns on when the core temp of the Xbox One is 86 degrees F. Then turns off. Why not have a button for when you know you are going to be playing longer? On top of that, even when it's not on, it still makes noise - which is odd.

When my 360 had over heating issues, I looked at all the options out there and ultimately settled on a standard laptop fan that I rested the Xbox on and blew air straight up. If I ever feel the need to look for a cooling solution for the Xbox One that is probably what I would try first. While this Antec unit looks nice, I never got the 30% cooler results. I'm guessing that is in part to the design flaws I talked about above.

2214,3.0,"Star Trek Online has been hyped for quite a long time and after a little drama (company changes / rumors of vaporware) it is finally released.

Starting Up:
When starting out I was presented with the same basic ""create your character"" sequence that is common with most MMOs. A somewhat unique feature is to be able to give yourself specific traits. Character customization is good and keeps everybody looking different. You also get to pick whether you want to be part of the Federation or Klingon Empire (each comprises several different races). In this part of the game you also select what you want your ship to look like. You can do a reasonable amount of customization to your ship which keeps things looking a little unique between everybody. The intro/tutorial does a decent job of walking you through the basics of the interface and interaction with the world.

Game Play:
After everything is set up you start out by doing missions for different people.  After you get your missions, you leave the space dock and ""fly off"" to your mission location. What I found quickly is that the missions consist of two types.  Type one is essentially ""go to this location and kill the bad guys"". Type two is ""go to this location, beam to the surface, and kill the bad guys"".

As you kill more bad guys and complete your missions, you gain experience to improve your abilities (most of which help you to kill bad guys faster). After you gain enough experience you gain a new rank (go from Lt. to Lt. Cmdr.).  Each rank contains 10 grades. So the total number of ""levels"" you can obtain is 50 I believe.  After gaining rank you can buy better ships... so that you can more easily kill the bad guys.

Crafting/Gathering:
One feature is the ability to scan and collect resources. While traveling around you will come across - or can scan for - anomalies. When found you can scan them up close and collect different resources. These are used for the extremely simplistic crafting system. The idea is that you bring your different items that you have collected from the anomalies to a person and they will use them to upgrade some ship or personal item you are carrying. The idea isn't as bad as the implementation. During the time I've played so far you are extremely limited as to what you can upgrade and what upgrades are done. The upgrades also don't get you items that are really worth the effort of gathering the resources.

Exploration:
Not too familiar with this but my understanding is that you basically go around and complete missions (Kill stuff) for a group of systems within a sector. Then you are awarded exploration points - or something like that - which you can use to buy ship or personal items. Not much emphasis was put on this part of the game from what I can tell so far.

I haven't got into the PvP part of the game so that is absent from this review.

Pros:
You get to be a ship captain in a star trek environment.
If you liked the combat based episodes of Star Trek then this game is tailored for you.
Space combat mechanics is fairly well done and interesting.
A ""Hold your hand"" approach to game play. (Could be a con if you like the sandbox approach)

Cons:
If you are picky about graphics quality you will be disappointed.
Pretty much everything in the game is ""instanced"" and separated by ""rooms"". What this means is that you are never in a true ""Massively"" multiplayer environment. Most of the rooms you are in have roughly 50 people and the instances have even less.
Even with the instancing and rooms, the game universe feels small.
The game suffers from the typical ""grind"" to progress issues.
The point of the game is to shoot anything that moves (i.e. If you're not sure, shoot it). Many feel that this is not what Star Trek was/is about.
Little emphasis placed on Crafting/Gathering and Exploration.

Overall the game will appeal to people who want to play specifically because it is Star Trek. As far as an MMO is concerned... it is not. I suspect that even Star Trek fans (like myself) will want more than what is offered here. I've found the general consensus from people who participated in the open beta is that the game has so much potential but falls short on the delivery.

My recommendation is to wait a few months to buy the game until it is complete and some of the ""Afterthought"" features are finished.",0.005125864011003328
2215,3.0,"When I bought this game, I was excited. I was always intrigued by the legends and always wanted to play as them in a video game. So when I heard about this game, I certainly made it a goal to get this game. However, I was definitely disappointing in the final product. Even though it isn't a horrible game, it certainly doesn't provide any worthwhile or lasting impact.

The roster features many of the great legends of wrestling such has Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and many more. Also, you are able to import the roster from Smackdown vs Raw 2009 if you own a copy of the game. Your created wrestler from SVR 2009 can also be imported into this game as well, giving you the ability to create some crazy match-ups such as Hulk Hogan vs. Chris Jericho or something like that.

The modes are Relive, Rewrite, Redefine, and Tier Challenge (if i recall correctly). Relive has you repeating certain events in the matches that took place. Rewrite has you play as the historic loser and win with certain conditions in order to ""rewrite"" history. Redefine gives you the opportunity to play as either wrestler in the match and having you win fulfilling certain conditions. All of these are complete with nostalgic videos that highlight the match-up and the feud leading up the the match which really adds a nice touch to the game.

The graphics are in an action figure style as everyone looks very exaggerated and very over-the-top. The controls take some time to get used to as it is unlike any of the SvR games. In addition, the matches are much less in-depth and much less strategic. There is not much to interact with in the ring, and the wrestling feels over-simplified at best. There are many quick-time events which slow the pacing of the match dramatically. There aren't many match types to choose from and not all of the Wrestlemania arenas are available.

Overall, there's not much to this game that makes it stand out from the rest. The roster is great and the ability to import your created wrestler from SvR 2009 is a great touch, but everything else about the game falls flat. The game is shallow and extremely short.

But unlike Jak II and Jak 3, this game is not a free-roaming sandbox game, however that's not really such a bad thing. Now, let's start from the beginning with the story. Jak, Daxter, and Keira are flying literally to the ends of the earth where the planet isn't so well put together and pieces of it float along the sky with the oceans falling away into nothingness. This strange and interesting place is known as the Brink, and is apparently the only area left on the planet that has a good supply of Eco energy. Eco is in very short supply everywhere else, which is why Jak and his friends have gone to the Brink... to get more Eco. While flying in their modified Hellcat Cruiser, Jak and his posse are attacked by Sky Pirates, led by the Errol Flynn wannabe Captain Phoenix. During the fisticuffs between Jak and Phoenix, Jak finds out that he can no longer transform into his Dark Jak state due to how unstable the planet's Eco has become. That sucks. After the fight ends, Jak and his friends crash land onto one of the floating landmasses nearby, and that's where the player finally takes control of Jak. You'll soon notice he doesn't control quite as well as he did in the previous games. Making Jak do sharp turns or making him turn all the way around doesn't go so smoothly sometimes, you tend to have to jerk the control stick a little harder than you normally would. Also, Jak can no longer duck, crawl, perform his cannonball jump, or holster his weapon. While some of these moves aren't really necessary, not having them really makes you aware that you're playing a ported game with inferior PSP programming.

Having just mentioned Jak's weapon a sentence ago, I'll discuss that next. Jak is armed with a gunstaff, which actually works a lot like the morph gun he used in the second and third games, only it's a big orange staff that could open up into a firearm. Like the morph gun, Jak's gunstaff lets him use four gun mods that he acquires as the game progresses; he has the familiar Scattergun, Blaster, and Vulcan Fury, but his last weapon is no longer the Dark Eco powered Peace Maker, but the Green Eco powered Lobber. Like a grenade launcher, the Lobber ""lobs"" out a ball of Green Eco that explodes on contact with an enemy or sits for a couple of seconds on the ground and then blows up. While more powerful than the first three weapons, the Lobber pales in comparison to the Peace Maker; plus, since when is Green Eco a harmful energy source? It's always been used for healing, so how can it be made into weapons grade ammunition? This just kind of bugs me, so does the fact that Jak has been reduced to using four weapons like in Jak II and was downgraded from twelve weapons like in Jak 3. Let's take a tally: jerky controls and moves, no more Dark or Light Jak, and less weapons. These are, in my opinion, the worst qualities of this game. Also, the story is a bit unclear and vague at times, mostly in regards to who the good guys and bad guys are. The Sky Pirates, in their Phantom Blade airship, are battling their enemies the Aeropans, led by Duke Skyheed, and they ride in their aptly named flagship the ACS Behemoth. The game has you think one side is bad, but then without much of an explanation, the other side becomes the bad one. The story could have been a bit more fleshed out, but otherwise it's interesting... just not as much as the stories of the previous games. Fortunately, the other aspects of this game fare better.

While no longer able to use his Dark and Light Eco forms, Jak soon makes contact with Precursor Idols that grant him new Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow Eco powers. These new powers include: shooting rocket-like bursts of Yellow Eco from Jak's hands that allow him to shoot upwards into the air to reach higher ledges, like if he were using a jetpack; releasing a large ball of crackling Red Eco energy that floats forward some distance and can be detonated by shooting at it, with the explosion capable of destroying several enemies at once; and using Blue Eco energy to make a slow-motion affect where Jak moves much more quickly than everything else for a limited time, much like the Light Freeze ability of Light Jak in the third game. There are several other powers as well, but I'll let you see them for yourselves. These powers also let you reach certain areas you might not be able to reach the first time you visit them, so when you do revisit them with the needed Eco power, Jak can usually find upgrades for his gunstaff or armor upgrades that increase his health. You'll be able to revisit areas about a quarter of the way through the game once the Phantom Blade becomes your main base of operations (I won't spoil how that ends up happening). Jak can still absorb Dark Eco from fallen enemies, then go to Keira, who is now a sage in training, and have her transmute the Dark Eco into either Blue, Red, Green, or Yellow Eco points, which Jak can use to give his Eco powers several upgrades in terms of how long certain powers last after using them or increasing the damage of other powers; or he could add Yellow and Red Eco elements to his regular physical attacks or increase his health even further with Green Eco upgrades.

Aside from Jak, you once again control Daxter in a few instances, only he's changed a bit. Early in the game, after being exposed to Dark Eco (again), Daxter goes through set-pieces where he transforms into Dark Daxter: in this form he grows somewhat larger than a regular person, grows large spikes on his back, gets much darker fur, and has a beastly voice. He also gains greater strength, the ability to throw balls of Dark Eco, and after absorbing enough Dark Eco energy, he can spin around like the Tasmanian Devil and create a Dark Eco Tornado with which he can break through barriers and destroy enemies. These Dark Daxter playthroughs normally involve him just traveling through dark, dank corridors, getting through traps and barriers, and fighting the same regular enemies Jak faces: robots, large spiders, and Dark Warriors empowered by Dark Eco; these set-pieces are fun while they last, but they're just not fun enough to make you want to play them any longer than you already do.

While one half of the game consists of the regular platforming action, the other half consists of Jak and Daxter flying around in the air in one of several customizable airships (about 4 or 5), some of which have unique weapons and other attributes. You can take down enemy airships by either shooting them down or by launching Daxter at them, and then through QTE button prompts and turnings of the analog sticks, Daxter will take out important parts from the enemy ships and destroy them, netting you spare parts for which you can upgrade the weapons, armor, or speed of your own airships. In the Phantom Blade's main hangar, the scrap metal you get from shooting down enemy ships can also be traded for these same upgrades. Most of the air combat is fun, but a couple of the flying missions are quite annoying since they have you destroying many targets being guarded by endless waves of enemy airships that often destroy you when you're aggravatingly close to completing the mission. Let's end with the boss fights. Once again there are only a handful of them and they offer decent enough challenges, but the biggest reason why they're challenging is because they have rather long health bars. The bosses in the previous games had shorter health bars, but offered greater strategic challenges. However, special note has to go to the next to last boss which is basically a Frankenstein gorilla mutated by Dark Eco... he'll make you want to throw your controller through the television screen. Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier has the platforming action, great graphics, familiar (though less plentiful) humor of its predecessors, and pretty cool air combat; but with its less fluid controls and slightly less interesting story, it just doesn't quite reach the same level of greatness as the games that came before it.",-0.017359141781600182

2224,3.0,"I've been reading a lot of the review about this controller including the one on best buy, and here at Amazon because I wanted so much to buy this controller since my original broke due to that I opened it to clean and could not put it back properly. Here's my 2 cents, I'm a game developer and I've modded a lot of ""stuff"" so I know what practically works without even touching it. From the reviews here are the list of problems that customers are having: controller lag, breaks easily, and in game functionality. Well, MAD CAT is a third party company and it's sad to say that they are using the name ""Black Op"" to sell their product which catches a lot of customer because it's an epic game. Truth is, because of USB connection the probability of lag is great. Again, since they are third party company you cannot really expect the product to be sturdy. I had bought a Wii controller from them and as much I'd like to throw them in the trash I had no choice but to use them. (Don't ask why). The in game functionality problem is probably caused by the ""genius design"" (of whoever came up with it) to use USB instead of implementing the same technology as the original controller. After all, if something as expensive as this device why not make it work as the original and add those bonus features. Don't even talk to me about copy right crap because in real world, ""who cares? as long as it works"". I give this 3 stars because I'll be honest, I don't have it yet and won't probably buy it for two reasons: USB and lack of reliability. However, 2 thumbs up for the idea of making a mappable buttons for a PS3 controller. Drop the price for another 20 dollars or so, and maybe just maybe I'll give it a chance.",0.014297298717466786

2228,3.0,"Here are my impressions about 5 hours in . . .

PROS:
Moments like where you're coasting alongside a huge freighter with a monstrous planet closer than a moon's throw away.
Love the seamless planet-space-planet travel.
Haven't bought any yet, but looking forward to getting better multi-tools and ships!
Fairly intuitive. First hour was a bit rough but quickly getting the hang of all the menus and screens.

CONS and NITPICKINGS:
--So far, my absolute biggest complaint is the ""harvest materials"" aspect of the game. Takes too much away from the exploration. A good compromise would be to have ""Harvester Drones"" that can be programmed to collect materials, freeing the player to spend more time exploring and not zapping plants and rocks every minute with a laser. Seriously! Do you think in the year 3000 that PEOPLE are going to waste time zapping plants for carbon? No way. Delegate those boring jobs to robots!
--You arrive on a planet and are just about to pat yourself on the back for going where no one has gone before . . . but no . . . the ubiquitous drones are--in my experience--always present, a constant reminder that they were there first, not you. So much for feeling special.
--Apart from needing to replenish your suit and life-support, I never felt any real sense of *danger*. Once I had a warning about a sandstorm, but it wasn't very impressive (I've seen far worse in Iraq). Or it may warn you about freezing temperatures, but if that's the case then shouldn't your visor be collecting frost resulting in a partial or full obstruction of vision? On the hot planets shouldn't you be seeing disorienting heat waves? --For the love of hamsters, they need to have a simple setting to change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
--Naming plants and animals is not really interesting. What's the point in giving a thoughtful, unique name to something that was just randomly hashed together and that you'll see a cousin of two planets over?
--Climbing mountains is way too easy. It feels like you're just gliding over them. At least make them like the mountains in Skyrim where the mountains required a lot more skill to summit.
--Finally, space--what I've seen of it--is not very imposing when it's often hued in different colors. Would love to see more pitch black and pin-point stars.

I'm hoping that later upgrades make the material gathering less of an issue, it's not bad enough for me to pan the game at one star, but it is certainly keeping me from giving it 5 or even 4.",0.043658832762534586

2234,3.0,"This game is very much fun for me. I always wanted to play a real life FPS like this which would at least make me feel like firing real guns for real effect. There is a Sniper mission in Cod4 MW1 in which you have to sneak within enemy lines and take out a terrorist leader. I immensely enjoyed that mission due to the dread it gave me of being discovered, even though i was playing against AI bots. Also the one shot kills with sniper gun is what i like to play like - Precise, minimum shots and mostly stealth. I have been waiting for such an experience for so long till i got my hands on OFP:DG.

Almost all of OFP's missions are like above. This sense of dread of being killed off instantly by anybody else with a gun is perfect! Even though the AI bots are dumb, they sure know how to fire in your direction. And if at least 1 out of 10 bullets they fire lands on you, you can end up with a minor flesh wound to incapacitated to dead with a critical shot. So playing against AI is very challenging and you have to kill them as soon as they spot you. You cannot hide  because they will come around your position ready to fire at you. CQB with AI is a very unstable situation from which you won't walk out alive most of the time.

The best way to get kills is to spot and snipe enemies with marksman rifles from up to 100-300m away and use sniper rifles above that range. I only do single shot firing as anything else destroys the accuracy and wastes bullets. For firing over 400m, some bullet path adjusting need to be done. But below that range you will hit where you aim, if you counter the recoil. I always find myself killing AI team mates to steal their marksman and sniper rifles if they happen to have it :) . The night ops mod guns are the best during night missions as you can search the landscape for enemies that appear white.

Now after this initial buzz, i would like to get into the real trouble bugging this game.

1. The friendly AI is dumb and irritating at times. If you ask them to move to a position they will move 100 metres away from it and keep walking towards the enemy. In a mission that requires you to rescue downed pilots, as soon as you discover the AI pilots, they assume command of your team or something, instead of following your orders.  When i say ""follow me"" they will say the same thing and go in the direction of the chasing and gunning enemy only to get killed and fail the mission. The only way to solve this was to take out all enemies before discovering the hostages and leading them to safety. When i am mounted on a vehicle, if i order the AI to move from point A to B, they tend to take the straight line path and get stuck at obstacles.

2. The enemy AI is predictable and always chickens out and falls prone to the ground if you fire near their heads/shoulders. And in all the fuss to get back up they are sitting ducks to my fire. I did encounter some instances in which the enemy fired from inside/behind a wall. There is no way they could see me coming.

3. There are a sht-load of problems with the buggy multiplayer.
3.1 You can see soldiers dead and stuck in the sky if you kill them during a helicopter ride.
3.2 You can shoot an enemy 15 times with a sniper rifle at 100m and he still won't die. But you can kill him with a vehicle mounted gun
3.3 Often gets disconnected from hosts
3.4 If host leaves, game ends. They should have learned from Cod4
3.5 Got kicked due to some unknown reason a few times. Was it the host player or was it because i shot at friendly AI players?
3.6 Mostly lagging players cause frictional jerky movement especially in vehicles.

Some of the ways to make this game better will be fixing the multiplayer issues. Also add a way to choose weapons in single and multi player as it adds a lot of re-playability. In addition, more maps/missions should be added as DLC for single and multi player. The single player was extremely short and there was no big war anywhere as every mission amounted to only a short skirmish.",-0.032878931111515436

Any game that says ""even better with kinect"" means it will be limited in actual kinect game play which is very sad.

I wish it wasn't a rail shooter but what it does on the rail it does well and keeps things fresh with different environments. It makes excellent use of weapons that are easily interchangable when playing with the kinect portion of the game. Though you are limited to just three interchangeable weapons (spells)per mini game it is still a blast to play for the five minutes each mini game lasts.

I just liked the way that you had to make our own paths and get the little people to bring all your things from one end of the map to the other.

You are Nick Kang, you're mother was killed as a child and your father disappeared, now you are a sarcastic and reckless adult.  You have an outstanding criminal record but you are the best person when it comes to clutch decisions.  The chief of a new branch of LAPD law enforcement recruits you to be the first field agent.  You then have to fight chinese and russian gangs and clean up the streets of LA.  Well I like the game's concept but they delivered it really poorly.  There are 3 main parts of the game, driving, shooting and fighting.  The driving is pretty cool because you get to ride and cruise around in a very well recreated LA. The shooting is ok although you don't run out of ammo, which in a way is a good thing for people who like the games to be easy.  The fighting is pretty cheesy though you only have 4 types of moves, the punchm low kick, jumping kick, and grapple moves.  Outside of the storyline you have petty street crimes to deal with.  I felt these to be kind've challenging, mainly because of the good cop bad cop thing.  If you beat the person unconscious and then handcuff them you get a good cop rating but if you kill them you get a bad cop rating.  I was trying to get a good cop rating by instead of deliberately kiling them I shot them in the leg to injure them or slow them down, well it did neither.  The person kept on running at the same speed or it took a bullet in the leg to kill them.

I didn't know that there wasn't an additional protective film on the back as there was on the front so when I peeled it apart I put my fingers all over it and got prints and dust stuck on the actual shield that you flip over to put on the screen.

I liken this situation to the contrast between Batman: Vengeance (which was great) to Rise of Sin Tzu (total flop.)

2260,3.0,Game is very cool and I love how it's a change from the normal Forza sims. Graphics are nice and the races to the top are for the most part on the easier side when on default-normal mode. About a quarter of the way through this game however I started realizing that the fastest car (Bugatti EB110 + engine swap and upgraded to the max = all 10's and 9.9 handling...kills everything) is revealed in one of the barn's. I played the game in a way perhaps many do not. I rarely bought any cars but rather I upgraded what I won from previous races or what I found from the hidden barns and progressed throughout the game without spending much. I bought really only the cars I needed for particular races that I did not have in my garage. I used the cars I won and upgraded those and won the races when I needed to. The problem is...when you have the fastest car early in the game you slowly begin to realize winning more credit money is pointless when you're dominating speed traps all around Colorado with what you currently have. Why then buy more fast cars when they're aren't quite as fast? Then when you get to the top and beat the top guy you pretty much win the entire game and win a ton of money I never ended up spending. The game served it's purpose but after you win it really has low replay value and it becomes an open boring world of well......driving around town. More races would have been nice but kudos for a short fun game! Buy it when it's under $30 and you'll have greater appreciation for it! Time for the next game...,0.07918553284844963

2262,3.0,"The Silent Hill series has been around for years, and despite being a fan of supernatural/horror games, I never got around to picking it up, after hearing that it was more focused on the psychological horror aspect, rather then normal, ""I'm going to tear your face off"" horror aspect.  Yet, after seeing the film adaptation of the series, I decided to dive in and try out the Silent Hill series, and ""Homecoming"" was my first visit to the infamous town.

""Homecoming"" follows Alex Shepard, a young soldier heading home to be back with his family after a stay in a rather unsettling hospital.  But once he arrives home, Alex finds that his hometown is now shrouded in fog, the town's residents are all but missing, his brother is missing, and oh yeah, demonic beasties roam the streets.  Now Alex has to not only find his brother, but also discover exactly what's going on, and if he can stop it.

Despite my initial hesitation about heavy psychological angst, ""Homecoming"" quickly drew me in with plenty of monsters to fight, lots of fog, dark caverns, and dilapidated buildings, which creates an excellent atmosphere that's a lot of fun to go through.  And to add icing to the atmosphere cake, ""Homecoming"" features a story that was genuinely interesting and kept my interest all the way through, including moments where you have to make some really personal choices that affect which of the five endings you'll get.  Fans of the film will be pleased to see a few elements make their way in, such as the nasty little bugs, the real time transitions between the real world and the bloody otherworld, and Pyramid Head himself; he doesn't show up often, but when he does, he easily steals the show.

However, while ""Homecoming"" may offer a great atmosphere and compelling story, it falls short in the combat department.  While ""Homecoming"" makes it a large selling point, citing Alex's military experience, the combat system relies on precise timing of attacks, rather then just bashing away at enemies with whatever weapon you have on hand (Ironically, the knife based weapons are the best, as you can attack very quickly, making it difficult for enemies to attack you back).  While you do have a dodge button that you MUST master if you want to beat the game, it only works about half the time, and because of that, you'll die a lot...every time I died while playing ""Homecoming,"" I felt like the game had been cheating on me, which made things frustrating very quickly, especially with those damn nurses.

Aside from the combat, there are a few other annoyances:  While Alex's brother, Josh, is a huge part of the story, he embraces the horror cliche of running away from you whenever you come across him, to the point where by the end, I wanted to shoot him in the legs just so the brat would stop running from me.  There's also a sewer stage that, despite the potential for a really creepy underground atmosphere, ends up being arguably the most tedious and boring sewer level I've ever played in a game, and I was very glad to see it end.

Still, despite the frustrating combat and a few little annoyances, ""Homecoming"" does offer a great atmosphere and a genuinely compelling story, along with some really memorable choices that you have to make (and a gripping quicktime sequence in the third act that I won't spoil).  Overall, ""Homecoming"" is an average game that's definitely worth checking out at least once for fans of the franchise, and newcomers like me will find it enjoyable, but a little frustrating along the way.",-0.018896445267335395

2268,3.0,"I have to say that the kids really loved playing this game. They are now Smurf fans some 30 years after I was. This games seems to be the typical spin-off you find out there upon a new movie release. You may know the games. They typically all seem to run off of a generic gameplay engine, feature some good clips from the movie, follow along or extend the movie's storyline, and are great fun till the newness wears off. Novelty games. This one is definitely fits that bill.

The gameplay is a side scroller that you can use different characters (surfs) which have different abilities to win different levels. You are expected and in fact required to re-visit levels with new un-locked smurfs to acquire all the hidden stars to un-lock new levels and characters. You collect the many surf-berries that are on each level. You can get hit by bad-guys and will only loose if you get hit while you don't have any berries. When you get hit and you have berries they are all knocked out of your character. As long as you grab a least one you will be able to get hit again and not loose a turn. This type of game play naturally challenges you to collect as many berries as possible and reach the finish line with all your collected berries, but I must say it is very frustrating to carefully navigate the level only to lose 400 berries right before the finish. You want to collect as many as possible and get more points but it really counts for not much in the end.

The game lost its appeal after several days and no one ever plays it now that the movie has been out for a while. I doubt this game will get played again except if a Smurfs 3 movie comes out and then at that time only for a little bit to play along side the Smurfs 3 game that will probably be released. Or if a kid comes over who hasn't played it and for some reason is really interested in Smurfs then maybe it will get played again.

2271,3.0,"I really have mixed feelings on that game. First, I tried the training mode. It took a while to do a good preload but I finally got it. Then I had to do tricks and I decided that the training was over and that I would try my chance at the championship. Surprisingly, on the easy setting, I won almost all the races and got the gold cup on all the tournaments.

I really liked the various kind of vehicles that I could drive. For me, the best race setting was the rally mode. However, it was annoying when I got off the track and then I had a three seconds warning to get back on the track and when I did so, the game restarted me anyway.

So I realized that to get the snowmobile tournament, I had to win some tournaments on pro level. Maybe it is just me but I found out that it was too much aggravation. So I had about 5 hours of fun with that game.

The graphics were very good and the music is also excellent. You can add or delete songs in the options menu. Also, cards are awarded after some winnings and you use those to get extra parts.

2275,3.0,"I really wanted to like this game, and it does a lot of things right, but unfortunately, once you get through the first couple of chapters, it also does a lot of things wrong.

The battle system has potential, but more often than not it boils down to the same basic tactics, with only a few battles breaking out of the mold.  That's okay though - most folks don't play JRPGs for the brilliant tactical combat.

Where this game really falls down, in my opinion, is the plot and the characters - no spoilers here, but the actual plot ends up being somewhere between dull and painful to watch.  All the interesting character related plot ends up being either irrelevant, or ""Boy, we sure could have wrapped this up sooner if anyone had actually asked people why they were doing this.""  The entire thing feels very contrived, and the characters in the party do painfully stupid things for no good reason, and generally don't develop at all after the first few chapters.  The biggest problem with the game though, is simply the pacing - it goes on and on and on with very little actually happening until you finally reach the last chapter and you get the somewhat lackluster finish.

I'd love to be able to recommend this game more strongly - it seems like they were really trying to make a good game, but somehow, it ends up feeling very formulaic and lacks a soul.  Out of seventy some odd hours sunk into this game, I think I felt any actual emotion at most twice during the entire adventure.  It's a shame, because JRPGs live or die by their characters - and while the four heroes of Bravely Default start out promising, they eventually just settle into a rut and become bland and difficult to empathize with.",-0.03435615205776496
2276,3.0,"It seems the trend is to critique this game based on it being a Silent Hill game and not on the actual merits of the game itself. Having played the game with very little in the way of expectations, I was very pleasantly surprised. As far as dungeon crawlers go, this is easily one of the more entertaining ones. The combat is sleek and doesn't have some of the clunky slowdown one might expect when there are many enemies on the screen. A caveat to this is that combat can get repetitive on some floors with minimal enemy variations. Character customization is excellent (you can create your character and dress it in a variety of things) and weapon variety is extensive. Again, another caveat is that weapons will wear down and break but each level has many weapons, so you'll probably never run out (I didn't). The music is, in a way, catchy, and very much fits with the dungeons. It's similar to some of Akira Yamaoka's later themes with Homecoming and Shattered Memories (emphasis on electric instruments rather than ambiance). Lastly, the graphics are outstanding and the entire dungeon crawling experience is made all the more creepy with a Silent Hill veneer.

To wrap this review up, this game shouldn't be compared to previous Silent Hill games but should stand on its own merits. The game was intentionally designed to be a dungeon crawler. On that aspect, the game succeeds, making an enjoyable Silent Hill outing on the Vita.",0.013581032967222224
2277,3.0,"Uncharted 4's majorly high level of technical quality and production values are obviously palpable, and it's all been noted here by the numerous awe-stricken fans.  I will say the game contains meticulously and explicitly thought-out things like level planning/design, architecture, scripted playable segments of action/adventure that hasn't really been accomplished unto a level like this.  I've played every Uncharted since the first came out in '07.  In all honesty, I think this one is overrated.
I began not having a good time with it by around chapter 10/11; the game has become more of a chore for me to get through than anything.  I'm now just rushing through it to try to end it and get it over with.  I know I'm a rare case here, but that's just my honest experience.  The third act is just simply a bore, I'm sorry.  The amount of climbing and jumping you do is absurd, and how many times can we have Nate jump to a ledge, have it snap, and him go, ""Oh crap!"".  I find the intermittent combat perfunctory and frustrating and not very fun; I feel it's almost a downgrade from the third one.  This may sound frivolous but I also didn't like how they made the general exterior-navigating camera length be considerably far away from Drake; I prefer a closer camera to my character.  And I know this is a video game and it's made to be fun, but when you have a narrative like this with such superb acting, graphics this realistic, replete with character movement that's pretty on the level, you have to suspend A LOT of disbelief playing this game.  How many of those physically impossible one-handed grab saves can characters make on each other? (Naughty Dog really seems to like that!) How many times can Drake fall 3-4 stories and grab onto a small ledge with one hand?  It's pretty absurd if you take notice of these moments.  I wish Drake and Ellena actually got scared and nervous and unsure of themselves at times (most people would panic if they got trapped in a cave and their light source went out, not cracking a joke and being all zen calm.  And the puzzles?  I never liked to have to think too much when playing a game, and whenever I'd suspect a puzzle sequence to ensue I'd let out an exasperated sigh.  They're just not fun.
People may think I'm crazy, but I had the most fun playing the first game, which I'd say is probably my favorite, followed by 3.

I have played all of the LEGO games except the Harry Potter series, and this is by far the WORST game. Even Batman 1 was better than this - and at the time, THAT was my least favorite.

UPDATE: The game has received an update since this review was written, see my comment below:

NEGATIVES: the introduction of talking characters - stupid. And it looks like the upcoming LOTR game is going to use the actual dialogue from the movies. I still don't know how I feel about that, but I liked it better the old way. Second, the cut scenes - long and boring. Third, the ""breaks"" between levels. After each level finishes your only option is to ""continue story"" you can't stop or go back to the ""batcave"" so even if you want to stop after a level - you can't.

Plus, when a story finishes, you have to run through Gotham to the next level. In other words, in the huge city you have to find it. Impossible for a little kid, next to impossible for me without any earlier instruction on how to read the HUD. Which brings me to - FOURTH, the HUD. There are like 6 symbols up there, I have no idea what any of them mean. Worthless.

Fifth - Vehicles. Are worthless. Do yourself a favor never jump in them. In Indiana Jones if they flipped over, you could flip them back, right side up -not here. They stay upside down forever. Also, you can get them stuck in lots of places. I drove the batcycle into a wall once and it stayed half in it. Which brings me to...

Sixth - glitches. Tons of them. My game froze at least 3x, and had characters stuck behind objects, or stuck INSIDE objects multiple times. I can't believe this game went through the same cross checks as the ones in the past.

Seventh - the game is SHORT. Probably a third the size of a normal LEGO game, here are the total levels:

  5A. Theatrical Pursuits
  5B. Harbouring a Criminal
  5C. Arkham Asylum Antics
  5D. Asylum Assignment
  5E. Chemical Crisis
  5F. Chemical Signature
  5G. Unwelcome Guests
  5H. Destination Metropolis
  5I. Research and Development
  5J. Down To Earth
  5K. Underground Retreat
  5L. The Next President
  5M. Core Instability
  5N. Tower Defiance
  5O. Heroes Unite

That's it. Your first time through, you've maybe solved 10% of the game. Now your job is to run all over GOTHAM (which is an enormous map) and ""find"" puzzles and extra characters so you can buy them (no store feature) so that you can go back into the game and finish the remaining 80%.

Eighth - GOTHAM is huge and ""same looking"" and there are no ""directions"" about where to go or what to solve. You just basically run around, get lost, keep checking the map to see where you've been and ""try"" to find things.

POSITIVE: the basic story of the game (once you're in it) is fun. But you can't ""finish"" any level unless you have LEX LUTHOR and his Deconstructor ray.

SPOILERS: Lex Luthor - District: Yacht Club Location: On top of the clubhouse itself. Battle: Punch him three times while avoiding his Deconstructor. Price: 250,000

Joker is in the District: Ace Chemicals, Location: On top of the main building, just above the terminal. Battle: Joker will grab you with his electric buzzer just like in the story  battle.  Switch to the other character and punch him three times. Price: 250,000

2282,3.0,"This game seems pretty polarizing among the reviewers. People either really love the game play or they hate it. Everyone basically agrees that the leveling system is pretty whack, which I would have to also agree. There is no way to check your progress toward new attributes - no exp bar, no status screen for your fighters, nothing. You basically ""awaken"" new abilities and stats based on the difficulty of the enemy. Sometimes you might up your attack three times on a specific enemy type, other times you won't upgrade anything at all. It is all luck of the draw. The randomness of the character progression has lead to me doing A LOT of grinding, which I don't mind too much.

My main gripes are as follows:

1. The town hub is basically useless. The inn is the only place you will routinely visit to save and rest, but the bar and item shop are garbage. Nothing worth hearing in the bar and the item shop usually carries some stuff that you out leveled or one thing you can never afford. The ship yard is pretty neat, but the items it brings back are most likely just to be vendored.

2. Enemies you could previously steam roll will suddenly have a new attack pattern you have never seen before that could potentially wipe your party. You see the same enemy you have destroyed countless times so you let your guard down, but then they do a huge AOE attack you have never seen before and your party nearly wipes. Thats great.

3. I have had HUGE frame rate drops during fights where multiple enemies are present. In the boiling see map you can have as many as 8 flying enemies and the game lags pretty badly. Even five enemies can make the game run noticeably slower.

I would probably lower the game one more star if I hadn't purchased the day one edition. The hardcover art book and soundtrack help to make up for some of the short comings this game has. Hopefully in the sequel they can address some of the issues.",-0.0058494246981089055
2283,3.0,"This keyboard is solidly built and is a good match for amateur/low-level PC gamers looking to add a lot of overly flashy stuff to their setup at a low cost. Gamers looking for more functionality however, should look elsewhere. For comparison, I am using a SteelSeries Apex.

Pros:
*The keys are very smooth and quieter than my Apex's keys.
*The backlighting is very bright and colorful, and is easy and quick to switch color and brightness. You can also change between constant and a breathing/pulsing mode. This is really cool personally because my Sentey Revolution mouse also has a LED breathing pattern, even if they aren't entirely in sync.

Cons:
*Although this is marketed as a pro on the box, the high keycaps are a negative for me. For fast reaction timing, you generally want lower keycaps to reduce the time between your input and your intended action.
*I am also not a fan of the angle that the keys are at. Ergonomically, your elbows should be at the same level as the base of your keyboard (Don't believe me? Look up eSports photos where this holds true for most pro gamers). The flatter angle of these keys along with their high keycaps means more finger contact with the keys below your intended key and thus a higher risk of hitting them. In comparison, my Apex is sloped just right with low keycaps so I can reliably hit any key without making contact with the keys below them.
*I also don't appreciate the sharp angle on the right side that juts out. Aesthetically it makes sense but functionally it is excessive. It got in the way of my mouse movements and frustrated me to the point that I had to switch back to my Apex. My Apex is actually longer on the Etekcity but the flat edge is peripherally visually easy to keep track of. In comparison, the jut on the Etekcity is on the lower half of the keyboard and harder to peripherally visually keep track of; my mouse kept running into it.

2289,3.0,"The game basically breaks down to American muscle car racing on oval city tracks (my least favorite), European technical tracks, including a 24 minute (representing 24 hours) race at La Mans at the conclusion of each ""season"", and Japanese tracks which are a combination of drift, tight cornering types of tracks, and head-to-head downhill/uphill racing. I found the Japanese tracks to be the funnest to race, the problem is that there were only a handful of tracks (just four different tracks on the Japanese side). The Yokohama docks & Shibuya tracks were my favorites though it definitely took some time getting used to the handling/mechanics of the cars. I really liked how you earn sponsors as you progress through the game and by the time you have a few hours of play time in and have won a few races the sponsorship money adds up fast and you can easily purchase other cars. Plus its fun to play around changing the sponsors whose decals appear on your cars.

However, after running through all of the Japanese tracks and events there really wasn't anything left to do because I had ran a few of the American and European tracks and found them quite boring. The selection of cars was kind of skimpy too. But the graphics and audio were solid and the mechanics and realism of driving pretty good, too.

2295,3.0,"Don't get me wrong, this game has a lot going for it... for about a week.  Obviously this is an arcade game, and as a result the long-term gameplay  suffers.  I had a lot of fun with the ""world"" mode, but after a  certain time period, the practice sessions were determined by dumb luck,  and the singles/doubles matches were just too unforgiving.  Leaving you  with a customizable, though pointless and boring exhibition mode, and an  arcade mode that simply lined up 8 matches against 8 players in 8 different  locales.  Though 2-player games are always fun.
The money system used in  the ""world"" mode is great, until you've bought  everyone/place/thing.  Then, it's merely an exercise in frustration with  random training courses, and impossible matches.  The graphics here are  superb, as is the control (mostly) especially since the computer often  cheats FOR you in order to get far away shots.  But the option of only 2  volley styles (standard & lob) makes any sort of strategy a moot point,  and games typically devolve into ragged run-fests.
My advice: by all  means rent this title, as I have had loads of fun with it, and I don't  believe a better tennis title (besides Mario Tennis) has been released  since Super Tennis on SNES or ATP Tennis on Genesis.

Good Options like custom/normal cursor; volume controls for music and two types of sounds; 'eye candy' on/off.

Graphics okay but Find screens are a bit muddy.
Often have to pass by hidden Find screens (with needed objects) several times before they appear/ become available.
Have to run back and forth many times to different areas.
As is common with these games, every found object leads to 2 or 3 more needed objects until it's hard to keep track of them all and where they should go.
Storyline and most characters are not compelling.

2299,3.0,"So what do you get for the 50-70 dollars more cash that you would spend to get the Razer Naga Epic Chroma over getting a classic Naga MMO mouse?

Honestly not much. It is wireless which is a big plus for some I am sure, however, the wireless comes with its own issues. The DPI overall is lower than the wired counterpart and the tracking can have a few issues making it over all less smooth. If you are used to a quality High DPI mouse you may find yourself disappointed with no options to fix it. While on the wired if you like it lower you can move it down in settings. Further the battery life is not overly amazing meaning you are probably going to end up plugging it in by wire if you play more than a couple hours a day.

You do get some interchangeable plastic side pieces to make it as comfortable in your hand as possible, but again this has a downside. They have the battery under there which has a habit of popping out if it is ever dropped and sending the plastic mold piece usually in a random direction.

Alright but you still get programmable keys at least? Well you do get the program that does allow custom macro's which can be a big selling point for some people. It just for me personally I can make the macro's without the program and I kinda assume anyone who is tech savvy enough to want a macro setup like that would probably do so as well.

So in conclusion This is a decent wireless mouse, but I just cannot justify recommending this to anyone at the price point it is selling at. Not when you can get the limited edition Naga for almost a full hundred dollars less at time of writing and a good seventy dollars less for the wired version of the mouse which has higher DPI and response and connectivity.

The graphics are good.  The sound effects are dead-on, and sound just like the movies.  You can play either from the first person perspective or third.  The controls are intuitive, although you will have to look at the manual to figure out how to perform some functions.

The single player story mode is just too quick.  I think most people should be able to beat it on the medium setting under four hours.  Mercifully, there's an instant action mode so you can play Hoth over and over and over again (or whatever your favorite battle happens to be).

X-box live is just unmanagable.  With more than two or three people to a room, the game lags to a crawl.

2304,3.0,"After hearing how great this game is, I bought it on the day of the release.  Yup, I have to admit that it was fun driving anywhere around the city (even subways and water) to pick up/drop off passengers.  The computer comments were pretty funny and there was no slowdown when number of items were on the screen at the same time.
But after about 2 hours of playing, I realized how disappointed I was with this game.  As others have eluded to, it gets old driving around the same city.  There was no drivers or cars to unlock.  This makes longevity of the game questionable.  Also the fact that there's no 2 player mode made me cringe.  I'm not sure if the 4 characters had any differences between them either (though I heard they're suppose to).
Though this was a fun game, I ended up returning it after few days.  If you're looking for a fun driving game, you might want to pass on this one and try Rumble Racing instead.

2306,3.0,"While you start off in a desert open map, the world eventually expands into an open field, forest area. The freedom is there, but there are clearly limits to your path, and things end up being fairly blocked off, so don't expect to climb any rocks or hills or mountains in the distance. In that sense, a lot of what you see in the distance cannot be traveled on. Even when you unlock the car jet much later, you can't land on the hills and mountains. So much real estate that isn't traveled. Overall though, until the later missions, you have a good amount of land to explore with limits.

Your part of 4 heroes control well on foot, but you only control Noct in the basic game. He can wear a few different costumes, but nothing drastic. You can select your swords and choose the load out for your companions too. The game's day/night cycle is way too fast, so expect to be hassled to rest by your party quite often. When walking or running, they'll often break into the camera frame, then fall back out, then break back into frame, and it gets visually distracting, unlike other 4 party member games, where the other characters remain several meters back, so this is never a factor there. But here it is a minor distraction.

The biggest problem is the real time combat camera, which is fine outdoors, but once you get inside a building, the camera is literally all over the place, oftentimes not even on your character, so you have no idea what is happening as the camera sits looking at a wall as Noct is getting beaten to a pulp. You try to position it on him, but you're against a tight wall, so it bounces all over again. Not good at all for a AAA team regarding camera control. In this day and age, solutions are available if the team is skilled enough to find creative solutions to controlling the camera while indoors. This is not the case here. For combat, it's nice to have real time combat, but in this game, you'll often revert to the same exact attacks over and over unless you get creative and use different weapons and styles. The enemies attack and can almost instantly wipe out your character if you're under leveled. So grinding and leveling up is recommended though not necessary to complete the game.

The car controls are not very good either unless you don't mind having the game do most of the controlling for you. So if you want to steer offroad in the default game, not possible. If you want to weave around and do a reverse 180 spin, not possible. The car controls very stiffly and is not fun to drive, but primarily a means of transport and sight seeing.

Graphically, the game looks good, but when looking at the trees in the forest for example, everything tends to have a muddy appearance, as if the graphics were upgraded from a PS2 source. It's not bad but it's more like 720p, while the characters and foreground tend to be 1080p. That does put a damper on the beauty of the game, of which this game otherwise excels with the character designs of creatures and people.

The story was well told and generally good, and the game was mostly enjoyable despite the major flaws like the camera problem and clunky car controls.",0.007088950642159112

There are a ton of trailers, previews, sneak peaks, and gameplay that did not make it into the game or aren't in the game. With that said this is a decent game depending on what you want. That's the most important part. What type of game do you want? If you want a good Final Fantasy game or are a Final Fantasy fan you will not love this game.

- Good graphics.
- Good music.
- The food looks good and makes you hungry.

Cons:
- Horrible camera system that often times kill the great battle system.
- A lot of bugs and glitches (even with the patch) that will kill some of your progress, waste your time, or forces you to restart or reload.
- Very short. The actual game is less than 20hrs long.
- Little or no story. The game is only about seven chapters. The rest is mainly there for you to explore the world.
- No character development, explanations, lore, backstory, or buildup. Things kind of just 'happen' as you go along.
- The skill and magic usage is very watered down and simplified.
- Pacing is one of the worst in any game. Most chapters or scenes feel either dragged out or cut too short. Not a good balance.

I've gotten stuck inside a wall and yet a titan still manages to eat me. The titans themselves, every now and then get stuck inside a building, making it impossible to kill it. The titans occasionally bunch together in a huge group, making it incredibly hard, if not impossible to save a comrade. OH and one of my personal favorites, whenever a titan grabs an ally and you save them, the ""s.o.s."" indicator doesn't dissappear even though you saved your ally. If a titan jumps up in the air to try to land on you, they will twist their bodies in the most hilarious ways.
KoeiTechmo clearly did not test this game enough before release. It feels like they just pushed it out to meet a deadline with ZERO respect for the licence. Don't buy this game. It's worth a rental AT BEST!

2314,3.0,"K&L, started off pretty cool. The opening action scene was a lot of fun. Two prisoners being transported to another place, and then BAM, an escape occurs. You have cops and baddies blasting everywhere. You start off in a daze from the crash and you can barely move. Then you get your head straight and start booking it with Lynch and his members. You find a pistol inside a garage that gets swarmed with cop cars outside. All you can do is start blasting your way out. You finally get to another spot that gets swarmed also, but with a lot more cops. Your guys start screaming to just run for the building across from you. You have to run through a haze of bullets into a tiny doughnut shop which also gets surrounded and blasted at with windows getting shot out... and all you can do is wait for your get away driver.

Talk about fun.

Then there are even some more good missions after that, like a bank heist which ends up a lot like the movie 'Heat'. I was having a lot of fun.

But then after a few missions the story and scenarios just got...well..way off track. I mean seriously...you end up in a jungle for pete's sake.

Let me tell ya some goods and bad that I thought of this game.

Good:

1. The beginning missions. Lots of fun and made you feel like a bad guy. A transport escape, bank heist, running down some main streets shooting and trying to run from cops, a car chase scenario, and a few more.

2. The talking. Kane is a little more level headed, while Lynch is a little nutso. It was funny listening to Kane scream ""WHAT THE (enter a bad word here) WERE YOU THINKING...YOU CANT JUST KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE LIKE THAT!!!"" and then have Lynch respond pretty calmly with ""Oh relax...we got out of there didn't we?"", well...it fit just right for these two guys. Even though there was a lot of cursing (and I mean a LOT), it went well with supposedly two very bad men. Sometimes a little to much...even for a person with a sailors mouth.

3. The graphics weren't extremely bad. Sometimes it felt like PS2 graphics..then sometimes it looked much better. It never really did bother me.

Now for the bad:

1. The story. Wasnt hard to understand, but it just felt...really bland. It's like they wanted to do more with it than what they did. Felt really rushed.

2. The later missions. Even though they weren't...bad...they just felt incredibly out of place. I mean, come on...a jungle? And one time I even felt like I was in Iraq or something. Just wierd.

3. No sneaky sneaky. For instance, one time in the jungle I had to sneak up on a guy and tackle/kill him instead of shoot him. Well the guy would walk right up on me and not notice me. Or I could be in the same spot doing the exact same thing...and then he WOULD notice me. Also why in the heck would you give me a pistol with a silencer on it, but not make it where no one would hear it. I would silently shoot the guy and an army of men some 100 yards away would start blazing me down with fire. It made no sense.

4. The game is extremely to short and easy. I beat the game in 6 hours. SERIOUSLY. 6 hours. And I was playing on the second hardest difficulty. Sure I could try it on the hardest now, but I just don't want to.

5. Replay value. Maybe the first couple of levels are replay worthy, but after that...yeah...not really. Maybe if they had an option to play Lynch the second time through, I could see that being a huge boost for it...but sadly..there isn't that option.

6. The two endings. Hahahahaha. What a joke. At least I'll give them this. If you decide to take the ending where you can save some of your guys, you get to play another level.

And then the SO/SO:

1. The AI. Sometimes it was pretty good. You would have 20 cops just destroying everything around you trying to kill you. A haze of bullets everywhere. That was nice. But then, I could be running somewhere and out of nowhere I'd turn a corner and two cops would be standing there and never look at me. Just shooting at my buddies. That would make me roll my eyes.

2. Sorry...I had one more thing, and just cant think of it right now. Maybe I'll remember and edit this.

Also one last thing. I haven't played online (my router is jacked right now) and I haven't played Co-Op. So I'm not reviewing this portion.

So in the end, I would definitely recommend renting the game for a few bucks. It is not NEARLY as bad as some people are saying. When this came out, Assassins Creed and COD4 just came out a fews before it. Plus Bioshock was still a hot item. Buying is a no no though.

However I brought it back up to a 3 due to the amazing graphics, The V.A.T.S system, ease of the PIP Boy function and the card game Caravan.

The V.A.T.S system is a great feature for the not so advanced shooter. This feature pauses your enemy and indicates your chances of hitting certain body parts. Once you select the part you want to attack the rest is done before your eyes.

The PIP Boy which seems a little daunting at first is really intuitive and fun to use once you have the hang of. The PIP has your maps, weapons, apparel, game stats, etc.

Now one to my favorite feature.. Caravan, I love Caravan! Its a duel battle style card game. During the course of the game you run into characters who challenge you to play some Caravan. Good chance to stock up on currency once you mastered the art. Basically your #d cards are the cards worth points and the Face cards have special features. You have three spots on the boards to create a Caravan which is reaching your total to 21-26. If you look on Fallout Wiki pages there are a lot of good tutorials floating around.

***** Also a tip for anyone starting the game.. In the beginning of the game where you go and choose your stats for your character boost up your repair and your luck.

If you boost your luck you can basically clean house at the casinos playing max bets with Black Jack.

So summing things up its not a bad pick up considering you can probably pick this title up for under 5$ now.

My suggestion is that before you buy it brand new, go and rent it. In hindsight, that's what I wish I had done. Then I would have either bought a used copy for less, or just not bothered to buy it at all.",0.031046365914786964

I really don't see how people could give it a 5/5 unless all they really play is CS: Go and don't mind the heavy weight.

The display on this mouse just feels like when Logitech first added a display on a keyboard (Logitech G19) where it never really took off - hoping developers would add game stats on it.

I think looking down on the tiny display - on a side of a mouse - is like fiddling with your phone while you're driving; it doesn't really make sense unless you want to risk dying! (Every split second counts!) Sure, aesthetically, it is unique and definitely stands out from the market, especially if you want to personalize it more with your logo or you just really really want Nicolas Cage spinning on the side of the mouse.... Haha what?

However, I think it's pretty gimmicky when manufactures use the term ""OLED"" (kind of like saying it's ""HD"" sunglasses!) when it really doesn't matter when the display is basically monochrome and low resolution.

""For best results, images should be 128px x 36px and in black and white. Animations will play back at 10 frames per second."" There is also an option to invert the ""color"". Unless you really follow the specs, you really won't be able to make out your uploaded image. If you think you could upload a photo of your girlfriend (ahem, imaginary girlfriend?) on there, guess again... unless she's a dotmatrix character (no.. not dominatrix, dotmatrix) or something.

I think the real biggest selling point, and less gimmicky, is the haptic vibration feedback where it makes this mouse unique and gives a new gaming experience. Although the full potential of the vibration is very very limited in the amount of games (like barely any?), you are still able to assign vibration to the any mouse clicks/buttons each time you press it. If you just want it to vibrate every time you press right click, you can do that. It would have been nice if they were able to mimic game controller vibrations to the mouse and support a wide range of games.

It comes with a braided and unbraided microUSB cable that you connect on the bottom of the mouse (I much prefer Logitech G900's convenient method of connecting the USB). There is a button you must push down before you unplug the cord, but it's rather very difficult.

This is an optical mouse, but you could swap for a laser sensor that costs about $25.

The RGB glow is on the scroll wheel and SteelSeries logo only; it would have been nice if the forward/back button arrows lit up too.

This mouse has 7 programmable buttons: right/left click, scroll wheel, button below the scroll wheel, forward/back button, and thumb button between the LCD and forward button.

Pros:
- Haptic vibration; you can set each button to vibrate differently on every button press
- If you play CS: Go or other supported games (like maybe two others?!), you can have an enhanced feedback for more advantage uses.
- Put a spinning Nicolas Cage on the side of your mouse.... or personalize it your own way.
- Quiet mouse clicks (Logitech G900 has loud clicks) and doesn't feel cheap.

Cons:
- Although the palm plate is supposed to be interchangeable, and the plate that's already attached looks quite nice, you don't get any spares included! (I thought it would at least come with one) The top covers have to be purchased separately ($15), which I think is pretty lame.
- Barely any games that currently support its vibration feedback
- Don't expect much from the display; it is monochrome and 128x36 animated gif at max 10 FPS.
- The software should just include some cool animation selection
- Not for users who dislike heavy mouse weight
- There is one button right next to the LCD display that many people miss (assigned as Button 6), which is disabled by default, is actually hard to reach and you really have to extend your thumb forward; this mouse is made for palm grip users.
- The side buttons do not light up.
- Never a fan of SteelSerie's software; difficult to assign things. I tried to assign an OS shortcut on one of the buttons, like ""Show Desktop"" but it doesn't seem to work at all (Yes, I did click SAVE).

For me, I find the Logitech G900 to be really well-designed, precise, light - even wireless - and is a much superior mouse (of course, it costs a lot more). The SteelSeries Rival 700, on the other hand, just currently feels a bit gimmicky. It is certainly too soon to tell, but I don't really think the LCD would get much support, like the days of Logitech G19, and it really is rather gimmicky, especially with the limited monochrome low resolution display; it is something that's never been done before, so it does stand out from the market. However, I can see the haptic feedback to be a cool feature, as long the support can be achieved. If you don't like heavy mouse, this is definitely not for you. I'm sure this mouse would attract more buyers if it fully supported the game Overwatch that many people seem to be playing these days. I like to see more options to take advantage of the LCD screen, at least like it did on the Logitech G19, such as display clock/date/countdown/cpu memory or something useful like that!",0.008342437083998547

I got the PTO Expansion, the ETO Expansion, the MAW Expansion, the Korean Theater Construction Set - all the freebies. Everything but OFF, Firepower, and D-Day. And I loved it.
Now out of the box, it isn't quite worth it. The flight models are not very accurate, its way too easy to stall, you're enemies (the ai) always have the advantage, then do something stupid. For the most part, they're predictable. It wasn't too bad (I was still a novice at flight sims), but it wasn't too realistic. The best thing to do was to go as a gunner...an autopilot flies the plane better than you could.
Out of the box, when compared to IL-2, IL-2 is much better - better graphics, flight models, damage models, etc.

One thing that I did not know about and my major gripe with the game... It is absolutley linear in nature. Yes you can go all out guns or stealth around but the premise is that you get your mission and start at point A and go to point B. The mission ends then and there an you go back to headquarters for your next mission. AI is weak to say the least and stealthy approaches are laughable in how the computer handles it.

While it does offer you more approaches than say HL2 or other plain FPS games it still boils down to pure linear missions. Role playing amounts to leveling points in melee/small guns/large guns/lockpicking/electronics/etc. Nothing really special here and there is essentially no selling and/or buying items (a random walking npc will offer to sell 2 ammo clips here and there, plain vanilla stuff)

2336,3.0,"If you were considering whether to get Sims2 or Sims2 Pets for the PSP without a doubt I'd buy the Sims2.

This is more like the original Sims - no storyline and you just progress learning more skills and geting better careers and houses.

BUT it is far less entertaining than the PS2 versions I've played mostly because the lack of locations - your house and one park with a few shops.

The pets are annoying - they takes ages to train and wander off mid training session. You don't get that with learning skills at least the bookcases etc stay in one place. They are not fun pets either. All they seem to do is wander around leaving puddles. You are supposed to be able to scold them and train them but they wander off before you have time to deal with them.
There is a limit on how much you can furnish your house with even on the 3rd out of 4 house size layout. This limit is incredibly small and frustrating. You can't even leave many toys out for the pets to play with. If you exceed this level your Sims possesions catch on fire and you end up with a pile of ashes unless you sell the items in time.

You don't seem to need any skill to play it. I've been leaving it on overnight and the Sims seem to do better by themselves. I just carry on from where they've left off. If you get the skill level up they can get the money, careers and friendship levels up by themselves.

I do like it but it's the least entertaining Sims version I've played.

The good points are its the Sims who are a brilliant concept and it is a good game, there don't seem to be any major glitches - you don't get stuck behind furniture which spoiled a lot of the sims2 psp version. You can control and move around with your Sim in real time mode or in old style control mode line up a series of actions for them.

There are a few fun items - the benches in the park require investigation but overall it seems a little slow and boring with very little gain or progression for achieving anything.

I'd still recommend it if you like the Sims. If you don't have a PSP Sims game buy the Sims2 without the Pets. At least you can wander around lots of different locations and houses. Here it's a bit like Groundhog day.",0.03066680499699188
2337,3.0,"I am reviewing the APEX M750. It appears the reviews are mixed together with the APEX 800, so I wanted to clarify which I am reviewing.

Update to my original review:  After thinking my USB port was going bad, this keyboard finally died.  I've never had a keyboard die on me, normally I buy a new one when they are worn out.  Corsair keyboards normally last and last, so I will be going back to them.  Although I loved this keyboard..it's very expensive considering it doesn't last.

Original review:
Changing the lights was frustrating in the beginning because there is software available but I had to ask customer support for a link because the manual says nothing about software only the keystrokes with the SPECIAL key.  With the software, you can change the color, make it wave or not, and dim the lighting, etc.  Its great.  Lots of variations.

Customer support was fast and helpful.  They have chat on their website and they responded immediately when I hit the enter key.

The keyboard also has a firmware update as of 10/25/17.

I keep missing keys because I type relatively fast.  And each keystroke makes a fairly loud clicking noise, so it could be annoying to other people.  Also for some reason, I am hitting some key sequence that opens up a multitude of different windows, which is also frustrating.

My other keyboard was a Corsair Gaming K30 keyboard and I did not like the keys at first but I grew to love that keyboard.  The keys on this keyboard seem uncomfortable to type on toobut maybe with time I will like them too.

My Corsair keyboard has really accumulated dirt and crumbs under the keys and Im in the process of figuring out how to clean that as it looks to be a very tedious task and this one looks to be the same.",0.039515500857779

2339,3.0,"Wolfenstein continues to try to juggle the various beaten-to-death knives of WWII shooter, occult storyline, and ""interactive"" NPC's, and amazingly, does all three with only a handful of cuts and dropped pieces. Up front I'll say this is only for single player, as for some reason I can't even access multiplayer.

Wolfenstein continues to follow the occult-riddled Nazi escapades of agent B.J. Blazkowicz. Agent BJ (which an alarmingly large number of people call him without getting shot in the face) is dropped into Germany after sinking a German cruiser and finding a medallion that can both ward off bullets and flense thirty men down to the bone. Upon arriving, you discover a similar medallion, just prior to being given a briefing by a member of the Golden Dawn (Alister Crowley makes no appearances to my knowledge) and are tasked with preventing General Zetta from opening a portal to the realm of the Black Sun and stealing the power of the Thules. While so much of this seems hackneyed and dried out, not too mention rather over the top, considering that amount of story gets rammed down your throat in the first ten to twenty minutes, its delivered in such a way that it doesn't seem like the same ol thing.

Interactions are a bit strange. Some NPC's are interactive, and will calmly hold a discussion while a German platoon is attempting to fill you with lead. You purchase upgrades through the black market by finding bags and bars of gold(because cash is apparently for sissies), though after finding five dozen bags or so, I'd probably have absconded to buy a Hawaiian island. The finding quests are actually worthwhile, finding blueprints to unlock new weapon upgrades and inject some nice side pieces of backstory, but while being in plain sight, rather than being buried under boxes or tucked behind impossible to spot hidden doors, they require you to scour every square centimeter of every level, since we know most people leave a bag of gold on the sidewalk tucked between two crates, where no one will ever find it, as opposed to in a safe. Searching is rather neat, a simple button hold that actually shows going through the motions of searching cabinets or threading bombs, but its surprisingly rarely used.

Combat manages to be exciting and annoying in turns. Most of your eyes have telescopic night vision, able to spot and alert to your presence when they appear as a speck in the distance even on high end TV's. the sorcerers you encounter are rather overpowered, and can soak up almost as many bullets as you can. Health is ridiculous, and reminiscent of the Getaway, basically hide long enough for the blood around your screen edge to fade, making this a cake walk even on Uber difficulty assuming that there's decent cover available. Several of the effects, namely the anti-gravity which allows you to pick off soldiers like slow flying skeet are entertaining.

Overall, this game is okay. Not great by any stretch, as they lock you out of too many neat bits and spoon feed you too much story too soon, but not as disappointing as I'd been led to believe. After all, who doesn't like a good Nazi shoot? A decent plot and some entertaining asides that manages to stop just short of being grindy make this a solid rent-to-own, though emphasis is on rent. And if your looking for MP Wolfenstein, I'd just as soon stick to the online freeware.",0.019876656883232688
2340,3.0,"So, anyone remeber the Spiderman game on N64? Yeah, this has graphics comparable to that. The circles are clearly not circular but like squares/triangles formed to make a circle just like old spiderman. But, boy did I love that spiderman game. This Hulk game is interesting. Its got pretty much nothing to do with the Incredible Hulk, except the name IMO....This guy can run along buildings and up them as easiilly as he can walk on earth. The cover of the case is exactly what to expecty but with better graphics, its like a green monster that looks nothing like the Hulk I know. Its hard for me to get into a game like that, because every second I'm reminded about it. But, I still play it, becasue its decent enough. I thought I'd be able to do more destruction though, becasue I can't blow up buildings like I wanted. I just wanted to punch them to dust. This game should not reflect the actual Hulk in my mind though, as this is more like a really big green monster. I did notice that some rare cutscenes have ""gorgeous""(on-par by todays standards) grpahics, but then other cutscenese go back to crap. For instance, in the beginning, theres this cutscene where you are looking into Bruce Banners log cabin in beautiful woods scenscape, and they are closeup on a bird and its like Hitman Blood Money cutscene graphics, Intense. Then it ""slowly fades"" to next cutscene, and its trying to say the cabin your looking at is the same cabin, but now its it the middle of the desert with one or two trees near it, and the graphics turn to crap. I can play with bad graphics but don't piss on my leg then tell me its raining. If you have bad graphics, make all cutscenese as bad. That way, I don't get any expectations I shouldn't get, and I also won't get thrown in and out of two compeletey different, ones a forest ones a dessert universes and have someone tell me its the same thing. no.... one was clealry in the desert and one clearly in the woods.

2341,3.0,"Call of Juarez: BiB is a great game for anyone who enjoys single-player first person shooters on the 360. It took me about eight hours to play through this game.

The environments looks fantastic and, if not anything else, are a great change of pace from most current FPS games. Most of the voice acting and dialog is pretty good (except for some from the Native American characters and a few lines of laugh-out-loud sexually-oriented dialog). The story is interesting and the McCall brothers are well developed characters (for a video game). Using some of the placed weaponry (canons, Gatling guns) is a lot of fun.

As someone who games quite a bit, I noticed that there are a couple of minor things that hold the game back a bit..

The quick-draw mechanic can be infuriating. Basically, your character stands on-screen for what seems like an eternity while you wait for a bell to ring, at which point you flick the right analog stick and fire, hoping to hit your opponent before he hits you. The main problem with this is that if you screw up, you reload the fight and end up standing there again for what seems like another eternity as you wait for the bell to ring. Another problem (which could easily just be me) is that by the time I got to the second quick-draw, I couldn't remember what controls to use because I'd been through a good 1.5 hours of additional regular FPS shooting and the game didn't bother to remind me in any way after I'd managed to lose the draw about ten times in a row.

Another issue is that auto-aim and sticky-aim can be turned on/off, but cannot be set to a specific sensitivity. Further, these settings seem to behave quite differently depending on which playable character is being controlled. I personally prefer to have little or no auto-aim, but it does help on some console shooters. This game either has it on full blast or not at all.

Lastly (and this is an issue in Call of Duty too), the computer players have better throwing AI than the NFL quarterbacks in Madden because they can practically throw dynamite into your lap from twenty to forty yards away without much trouble.

So, I would recommend that you buy this game for PC (if you are a hard-core gamer who prefers no auto-aim), or buy it for 360 once the price comes down to about $35.

However, the plot is told just at screens or in your ship, it's not so well-written. A lot of the levels don't feel too STAR WARS-esque, I think they should have introduced some SW Prequel dogfights into this, along with those ships. The codes are really cool, you can get all sorts of different ships, but they should be easier to input and save so you don't have to do it all the time. I love how the time adjusts in-game to the time that your Gamecube has, so if you're playing at dusk, Tatooine is at dusk also, and that's great. It makes it seem at least somewhat fresh, though they have you do some of the same exact things you did last time out, like race Wedge through the canyon and some missions are nearly the same as well. Voice talent is first rate, they got the actual Wedge and a reliable Mark Hamill impersonator. Ultimately, I feel RS1 was more interesting, more fun, just more exciting, RS2 seems like it should be more fun, and it isn't quite, maybe it was seeing the landscapes of RS1 being done on the N64... At any rate, some levels are great, just like the movies, others are made up and it's not fun to play the made-up levels (or levels from SW books), they aren't distinct as something from STAR WARS, it's like playing any other sci-fi shooter, maybe character interaction is key. I prefer to do what I've seen done in the films, maybe those few fights should have been concentrated on, given a few levels based on one scene, so the graphics could be even better and the gameplay could be more epic.

2359,3.0,"First off, let me say that I am an avid Tekken Tag player. It is probably my fav game of all time and I have spent much time mastering it. With that said: on to VF4. Everything about this game is is pretty good. The graphics are good (although I think they could be a little better) and the sound is good as well. The real winner here is the many technical moves and combos you can pull off with the characters. The shaolin monk and the drunk are the coolest characters to ever enter the fighting genre (with the exception of Lei from Tekken) The main problem I had with the game and the reason I only gave it 3 stars. (actually more like 3 1/2) is the button config./combo system. This is a real pain in... The fact that you have to hit an actual button to guard (instead of just holding back) is more of a pain than you can possibly imagine. And the combo system is very very very complicated and annoying.
So, if you can get past the annoying and complicated button config. then you got a fun game to play. It's a little to annoying for me, but I'm gonna keep playing it for a while and see if I can pick up on the config. a little better.
Good luck!",0.10065061912488382

Second, it's only good for fighting games. You can't play any other type of game using this controller, not just shouldn't...can't. And finally, the controls just aren't intuitive.

I guess I just don't have the patience for that, or maybe I am just not far enough into fighting games to want to invest the time.

PROs:

1) The keyboard itself looks really great, its well made, and the ligthing is very cool. It is brushed aluminum which is very easy to clean.
2)The keyboard has a mouse cord holder which is very nice, as well as a mic and mouse pass-through.
3) Brown Switches
4) The keys themselves are very responsive and easy to press...The whole thing is completely programmable, macro programming through recorder can be manually updated, there's different profiles for games and ext....it has a very solid construction with an excellent wrist pad.
5) The looks are not completely over the top and could potentially be used in a business environment (more so for developers) if set up correctly. But most likely... this is for at home
6) Can be programmed for lefties.

Really, the hardware of this keyboard is something anyone could hope for.

CONs:
1) Software...most horrendous experience ever at this point.
2) This keyboard fails on the customizable RGB lighting & programmable keys just because the software just isn't ready for prime time.
3) A lot of people I have talked to have also had issues getting the software to run in Windows, they had to reboot and delete all drivers multiple times... mine worked fine though.
4) The pass-through has not worked for numerous Logitech mouses.... I have a Logitech mouse that didn't pass through (USB not connected)... but mostly use my anchor mouse anyway and it works.
5) There is also potential for reboots of your computer to screw up your profile... so good luck with that

OVERALL: Amazing keyboard with the worst software ever. I would recommend waiting at this point to see if they can get all the glitches/etc fixed and more options added.

True fans of the IP will have fun, I guess, and it won't look as dated on the Vita (for better or worse) but I moved on to the similar and modern Tokyo Mirage Sessions after a few hours.

2367,3.0,"WWE 12 was the 13th game to be made as a part of the major WWE gaming series but was the first game to exclude any reference to Smackdown or Smackdown vs Raw, simply being referred to as WWE 12.

WWE 12 had many different things revamped and overhauled. For starters the weak/strong grapple was removed and replaced with a system where characters perform moves based on their physical state. For the first time since Raw 2, moves and Royal Rumble eliminations could be interrupted with a simple strike. The pin system also got majorly revamped as well. No longer would your controller have to take abuse from all the thumb mashing. Nope. Instead, there was a pin bar that was installed for players to use. When you get pinned, the pin bar will be presented to you with a smaller blue/red bar within the bigger pin bar. You must hold down the A or X button and successfully get the meter to stop in either the blue or red bar to kick out. The more damage you take in the match, the harder it will be to successfully kick out.

More new features included the comeback feature. You've seen it dozens of times on television since the 80s. After a superstar--usually the babyface, has taken a great amount of punishment during a match, they miraculously find enough strength in them to make a comeback that will potentially win them the match. Developers inserted that into WWE 12.  After a superstar takes enough damage, they will be eligible for a comeback that will be initiated with the press of a Y or triangle button. As you perform the comeback, you will be shown what buttons to push in order to successfully hit each move. If you don't push a button on time or push the wrong one, your opponent will reverse your comeback and your momentum will be ruined. The comeback feature can only be used once a match, so make sure you use it when you really need to. It also needs to be noted that not every superstar will have a comeback, but only select stars like John Cena, Edge, Undertaker, Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels, etc. Another new feature was the Breaking Point submission system--replacing the struggle submission system. Now whenever you place your opponent in a submission hold, the words ""breaking point"" will appear on the screen. You will have to button mash the controller to prevent your superstar or diva from tapping out to your opponent's hold. Should you be unable to escape your opponent's submission, the breaking point meter will fill up with red and then shatter, resembling you tapping out and losing the match. These were all cool features that made WWE 12 a lot of fun to play during matches.

WWE Universe Mode returned for a second year with a bit more added to it this time around. For starters, there's a 2 week draft event that takes place after Wrestlemania on Raw and Smackdown. Just like TV, draft picks are determined on what superstar wins a match--based on what respective brand they're a part of. For example, if Cody Rhodes; part of the Smackdown brand beats Daniel Bryan; part of the Raw brand, Cody will win Smackdown a draft pick. Draft picks--also like television are completely random and could result in anyone being drafted to an opposing brand from Eve Torres to The Undertaker. Championship matches could also be could also be played on any show, rather than just exclusively being reserved for PPVs. More cutscenes were also added to this mode.

Road To Wrestlemania returned for its 4th and final year. In this installation of RTWM, the story was split into 3 different sections for Villain, Outside, and Hero. The Villain story consists of you playing as Sheamus, the Outside story as Triple H, and the Hero story as a CAW named Jacob Cass. You no longer have the option of playing each story separately as they're all connected to each other, as one pours into the next. In the Villain story, you'll portray Sheamus as you slowly form a stable with William Regal, Drew McIntyre, Wade Barrett, and yourself--titled The United Kingdom. Upon the stable being formed, the 4 of you will work together to destroy the WWE and have ownership of every championship. Triple H's Outsider story starts at Wrestlemania 27 after Sheamus has managed to beat his UK members to claim ownership of every championship. HHH shows up and beats Sheamus to win the WWE Championship. In the Outsider story, you'll begin a feud with The Miz, who's looking to extinguish HHH from WWE at the upcoming King of the Ring tournament and be known as the only King of Kings in WWE. Eventually Miz will injure HHH's repaired quads with a chair, putting him out of action until the next year's Wrestlemania. When you return, you will have to work to put The Miz and his group of Mizfits--Cody Rhodes, Kane, Jack Swagger, Dolph Ziggler, and R-Truth out of commission before they put you on the shelf--this time for good. In the Hero story, you'll create a wrestler who'll go on to be named Jacob Cass. Things start out normal, but once Kevin Nash becomes the new general manager, things start to get hectic. Eventually it's revealed that Nash as GM was a ploy to bring back WCW and put WWE out of commission. Along the way, several WCW alumni such as Vader, Rey Mysterio, Booker T, Arn Anderson, Big Show, and Road Warrior Animal will step up to help Nash in his campaign to bring back WCW. It will eventually all lead to 6 vs 6 Elimination Tag Team Hell In A Cell match at Starrcade in a battle for supremacy. WWE vs WCW all over again.

Honestly, I did not enjoy WWE 12's rendition of Road To Wrestlemania. For many years prior to WWE 12, fans wanted to see backstage fights get brought back to games and in season mode. Well developers gave fans their wish, but the problem is that they overdid it. There's a backstage fight of some sort at least every week. Triple H's story was the worst, as more than half of your objectives involve you having to beat up people in backstage fights. On top of that, most matches are won through cutscenes and not you actually winning on your own. It was overkill and the developers fed it to players so much to the point it was boring rather than fun. WWE 12's RTWM is undoubtedly the worst RTWM story mode out of all games that had it. Luckily it was the last game that would feature Road To Wrestlemania as a story. Jacob Cass' story was probably the funnest to play--but only to an extent. I thought it was very silly at how they threw in a bag of random WCW names like Vader, Arn Anderson, and Animal to be a part of Team WCW. While they undoubtedly were a big part of WCW back in the late 80s and early 90s, they weren't really involved with it that much when the Monday Night Wars were going on. I think some other names that played a big part in the Monday Night Wars like Scott Steiner, Goldberg, and Scott Hall would've been better options than Vader, Arn, and Animal.

The roster included stars like Alberto Del Rio, Brodus Clay, Husky Harris, Alex Riley, Sin Cara, Michael McGillicutty, Heath Slater, Mason Ryan, Kharma, Ax & Smash of Demolition, and Arn Anderson all being playable characters for the very first time. In addition, DLC featured Kharma and J.R as first time playable characters. Brock Lesnar was also thrown in as a surprise playable character, making his first WWE game appearance for the first time since 2003's Smackdown Here Comes The Pain. The graphics were extremely good for their time and was the best they had ever looked during that time. The wrestlers, divas, and even arenas looked glossy, vibrant, and had a nice HD tone to them.

Overall: WWE 12 was a standard video game to put it mildly. Gameplay was fun to play, the roster was fairly wide, and I found myself more engaged with Universe Mode than I was the previous year with Smackdown vs Raw 2011. The only part of this game that really sucked the life out of it was the dreadful Road To Wrestlemania. Because RTWM was a major part of this game and ultimately the game's season mode, it should've been fun to play all the way throughout. Instead, you get faced with having to endure repeat backstage fights and repeat matches with repeat opponents. No wonder RTWM hasn't been in a WWE game since then. Overall, WWE 12 wasn't that bad but I've still seen better WWE video games made",0.006001665233682155

- Repetitive
- Controlling Iron Man is kind of clumsy.

- Ultimately boss fights are won by firing repulsors and missiles, and hiding behind large buildings to avoid getting hit - the game does not take advantage of the decently sized environments.
- Game also freezes after completion of the second-last mission- even with latest firmware update. Restarting and replaying that mission seems to solve the problem.

The only good things about this game would be its eye popping graphics, terrific sound, and realistic gameplay.  All of these things could have combined into a seriously good game, but it's limited by strange choices by the creators.

I don't understand why certain objectives are so far away from eachother.  It's realistic to drive a few miles in real life, why would I want to do it in a video game?  This is realism overboard.  The AI is also a sharp shooter with a machine gun and a lot of the objectives are timed.  I remember taking my time trying to set up the perfect attack in the first Flashpoint.  That's practically impossible now.  Lastly, and most annoying, is how you can't move your head when you drive.  You are stuck facing ahead.  You don't drive in real life like that, why do they make you do it in the game?  It makes no sense and makes it incredibly difficult to drive because you aren't aware of anything going on around you.

If you didn't watch the show you would not understand any of this game. But if you didn't watch the show I'm not sure why you'd play it. The game is very basic, completely linear and not very long. My biggest criticism is that if they took the time and the budget they could have made this a really great game. The framework is there but effort was not. It was a quick development to cash in on the show's popularity. If they made a sequel, which they never will at this point, there are so many concepts they could explore. You could choose a path, like to join the others, or you could remain with the crashed crew. Or you could have two paths at the start: start the game as an other, or start the game as a survivor.

2383,3.0,"I'm scanning this board reading the reviews, and I realize half the people haven't taken the time to figure out the things that are bothering them about the game before coming online and smearing it.  Are there flaws?  Yes.  Not as bad as what's being reported though.

There's plenty of game modes, but they're all fairly similiar.  Franchise and GM have all the same options with the exception of four or five manageable goals if you enter GM mode.  Completing goals raises your GM grade and increases budget.  The other negligable difference is that Franchise mode allows you to force trades through with the computer controlled teams, GM mode makes you use the ""Fair Trade"" system.  Which is hardly ever fair, even if you're trying to deal outside of your rival teams.  Both GM and franchise allow you to look at team pulse and measure team chemistry, which can make players better or worse.  You can call team meetings and choose your appropriate response to your teams recent play (note: It's not a good idea to make fun of all your player's mothers on the first day of the season, but the option is there).  Depending on the meeting and player, his morale will go up or down.  In both Franchise and GM mode, you can buy scouting reports on players/teams for a chunk of money. Depending on the team, it can get pricey.  There's also a home-run derby you can play, a manager mode (which consists of watching a screen, picking how you'd manage the game in a drop-down menu, and watching the results...zzz...), and a situation game.  Want to put your guy up in the bottom of the ninth with two men out, the bases juiced, and a full count?  Here's your shot.

There's a LOT of detail in this game, however they were very sloppy about several details.  A home opener in Milwaukee has the chance of rain.  This is all and well, except Miller Park has a retractable roof.  Maybe I'm nitpicking.  Players fall over if they collide on-field or into the walls.  This is extremely frustrating when you run down a ball in center field only to fall over from hitting the wall, even though it never would've happened in the majors.  Players overlap first, and get thrown out on a late relay.  If there's a runner safe on third, and you have the ball at home, a simple throw to third will get the computer to try for home 50-60% of the time.  Easy out, but very unrealistic.

Batting is an improvement, the swing stick makes hitting the ball easier than ever.  The L-stick is your hitters eye, line it up with where you think the pitch is going and if the pitch goes there, it helps you out when you swing.  If you pick the wrong area, everyone in the stadium laughs at you.  You pull back on the R-stick when the pitcher releases and let go for contact.  If you're a purist you can choose to push or pull the ball by going left/right on the R-stick.  Pushing all the way forward is a power swing.  You can choose to use all of this, or use none of it and have X be your swing button.  Be warned, the game will also freeze periodically during the pitch.  That tenth of a second is enough to really mess up the timing.  It is rare, but it does happen (especially online).

Baserunning frustrated me to no end until I realized in 2K's quest to simplify everything, they made it more complex.  Directional pad left tells all your runners to advance one base, DP right is to return.  The computer will tell your runners what to do if you do not.  You do not want this to happen.  I recommend selecting each runner individually with X, O, triangle, and square and use L1 to advance them ahead, or R1 to retreat them back.  This is still highly irregular and nowhere near the perfection of the MVP series.

Pitching is the most accurate part of the game.  You have to set a breaking point for your pitches with movement in order to compensate for the break of the ball.  After two strikes, or in a pitching jam, you're given the option of throwing a payoff pitch.  If you hit the target that's lit up on the screen, the pitch rating increases the rest of the game.  You do not want to miss it, though.

The thing that single most bothers me about the game, however, is the player rating system.  ESPN prides the game on being based on three years of statisics, then does injustices to each player in it by insulting them with their rating system.  It's obvious they're playing favorites with a team like the Yankees, and throwing guesses to the rest of the teams around the league.  Before you play, you might want to readjust the attributes to everyone on your team.  I wish I was kidding.

This is the price of one companies monopoly on sports licensing.  You get inferior products because they know you can't buy anything else.  I'm not going to say it's a great game, but it's not horrible either.  With outside competition, however, it would've been a lot better.  3/5",-0.018657894222110803
2384,3.0,I admit I was biased when I picked this title up because I was already immersed in Grand Theft Auto 3 and Gran Turismo 3 at the time.  I was not expecting this game to be anything like GTA3 but I did expect the quality to be similar.  Graphic wise Midnight club came up well short of the visuals in GTA3.  The city is bland and choppy.  Not convincing for a PS2 title.  The racing is ok but nothing spectacular.  Car physics are a tad sluggish and finding your way around can be a tedious chore.  Car selection is also very limited at the beginning of the game.  The difficulty is also a tad high but not too hard if you get into it.  Unfortunately I was not impressed since this was one of the first titles I owned for the PS2 and it just bored me.  GT3 is a far superb racing game and GTA3 is Rockstar's classic with GTA4 out now.  If you are thinking about picking this title up because of it's bargain price I would suggest you skip it and hit GT3 for the same tag.  Also Midnight Club 2 is comming out and it seems to have really beefed up the game so try the new version as this edition was just boring.,-0.0054194009879628595

This game doesn't feature double jump, charge shots, nor wall climb so after playing the X series, this feels really toned down. Besides the dashing mechanic, this game is more like the older NES version Megaman.  Its high difficulty level and basic run, shoot, jump really throws players for a loop since the character design makes it seem like it's meant for kids under 10.  I find myself yelling out loud at the screen when the first boss I encountered threw out an instant death move midway through the fight.

First boss I fought was Pyro. The road leading to him was full of insta-death moments and annoying fireballs, so getting through all that was a big relief.  During the fight his pattern isn't all that difficult, but it took some time figuring it out since you need to pay attention to visual cues.  I made the mistake of using audio queues (he would say something depending on the move he's about to do) but mid way through the fight, there's some dialogue that blocked out the boss's audio cues and I got grabbed for an instant death.  So after dying a few times I had to start the level over.  This was pretty frustrating.  After getting there again I started looking at his animations instead of listening, and that helped out a lot!  After this, every boss I fought, I noticed it's way better to use visuals to help you since midway through the fight a dialogue box would pop up those audio cues will not play.

2391,3.0,"As a PS3 owner and long-time gamer I've got more than a few Bluetooth headsets that I've used with my console. I started out with using a Motorola BT headset that I primarily used with my Motorola RAZR (that's how far back I've been using my PS3... whoa!). Graduated to a dedicated Logitech Wireless Vantage headset and finally settled on a wired Turtle Beach PX-21 most recently. I've also had experience in using Jabra, Plantronics, and Sony's official PS3 BT headset.

--------------------
SETUP:

Anyone who has ever paired a BT headset knows the routine - turn on your device you wish to pair to (PS3), go to Settings > Devices > BT devices > Scan. Then turn on the Gioteck EX03 and the device will appear as 'found' on-screen. Select the device, enter the pin: 0000 and the devices will pair. If you have any other audio input devices paired with your PS3 be sure to select the EX03 as you active input and output device. In simpler terms setup is as easy as any other BT device that I've used.

--------------------
DESIGN:

The EX03 looks like an adolescents BT headset. I don't mean that as a snipe or a bad thing, the device has a type of cool factor, though I wouldn't wear this on my ear in public. The EX03 is quite a bit larger than standard BT headsets that have tried to somewhat become as small as feasibly possible. The size can be attributed to both the ear look, the mic boom, and the actual earpiece/receiver. The design as I interpret it is more function over form.

The design of an over the ear loop and adjustable boom in my experience make this headset a bit more comfortable than traditional BT headsets, particularly those that don't have any type of over the ear support. This is particularly important during long gaming sessions. The boom is designed to adjust though within a very small tolerance. This is still important to anyone with a smaller or larger than average head. Additionally Gioteck includes a number of in-ear pieces so there options for comfort there as well.

Personally I found the headset to be comfortable for about an two hours before my ear really started to ache and bother me.

--------------------
USE:

In-game audio quality is a mixed bag. For certain this is a mono headset which is fine for communication with other players online, however, I found the audio quality sounded quite muffled. Especially compared to my PX-21 headset but even compared to my Plantronics BT headset that I primarily use with my smartphone.

Friends that I played with online had no complaints about my voice, background noise, or static.

--------------------
CONCLUSION:

This is a decent entry level headset. I'm hesitant to slam or praise this product as it does perform just not impressively so. If you can spare about ten more dollars I would recommend Sony's own PlayStation branded BT headset that in my opinion performs considerably better.

Notes:
There seems to be some confusion over what this headset will and won't let you hear. This is a headset for in-game communication with other players when playing online with your PS3. This headset cannot play back in-game audio or sound-effects.",0.062909336603545

2393,3.0,"Having heard good things about the first CRYSIS game, I was eager to give CRYSIS 2 a spin to see what the hype was all about. While I can certainly see why this series commands such a following, at the same time I was a bit underwhelmed with what was presented. . .

STORY: Absolutely throwaway. Right from the get-go I had no clue what was going on. So New York is under attack by aliens and patrolled by soldiers. What else is new? I would even say that the story felt a bit like Pac-Man in that I was basically chasing dots (the blue destination dots) just going from point to point.

CHARACTERS: Not very interesting. Let's see, I play the role of a mute maniac with a machine gun and yes, there's the scientist guy with Tourette's syndrome.

GRAPHICS: Pretty good, but I felt that a lot of the environments were too dark and drab to really appreciate it. I specifically remember towards the beginning of the game where I saw this brass-colored blob on the ground next to a mounted machine gun. Guess what it was? Probably the ugliest-looking bullet casings I have ever seen in a game.

GAMEPLAY: This is where the game gets some points in its favor . . .
--Headshots to every soldier in sight while cloaked is definitely entertaining.
--Holding your ground with armor activated and blasting everything to bits is also entertaining.
--I also liked the ability to modify weapons on the go, everything from sights to firing modes to secondary weapons.
--Some fairly interesting scripted sequences.
--IR mode makes you feel like Predator.
--A little bit of freedom in how you get to your destination.

. . . but still, all is not rosy and peachy. . .

--The main premise of CRYSIS is that you have a really powerful suit . . . but you start the game with almost all of your abilities locked in the name of ""holding your hand"" tutorial-style.

--I was absolutely baffled by the following: You can throw a bottle or bag of trash across the room. You can turn a computer on, work the printer and water cooler . . . but God forbid that you be able to do something useful like turn on a light-switch, pull the fire alarm for a diversion or interact with some of those infected people. I don't understand why a programmer would dedicate lines of code to allow my character to do something that is basically meaningless.

--Absolutely horrific AI. I stood on the second level of a building. At my feet was a hole in the floor where I was looking down on the heads of a bunch of soldiers. Do you think they ever bothered to look up? Even after bodies started heaping up in full view? Nope. They just walked around like the oblivious idiots they were. If you want to see some reactive AI, play F.E.A.R.

--Okay, so I've already told you that the AI is stupid. So why am I still dying? It's because one of the few good things about this game is that damage is somewhat realistic. Despite your Nano-suit, if you try and go Gung-Ho into the midst of battle, you're not going to last long.

--Unimpressive upgrades. I was really looking forward to upgrading my Nano-Suit. Let's see, there's bullet tracking, which sounds pointless because I'm cloaked almost the whole time and kill everyone before they even get a shot out. There's a bonus for ledge-grabbing and sprinting . . . also pointless because again, I stay cloaked most of the time and move slowly to make the most of it.
I basically unlocked the first two rows of upgrades for my suit and didn't find a single one that seemed worthwhile, considering the rarity of finding aliens to kill to be able to afford them.

OVERALL: I probably played a good 5-6 hours worth of this game (I got as far as finding the Hive), but in all that time the only upgrades available were pretty much worthless, which basically reduced this game to something that was half FPS and half Metal Gear. The lack of enemies was disappointing (nameless soldiers and chthonic aliens . . . again) and made even more disappointing given how stupid their AI was. Toss in a dark and drab environment and an absolutely uninspired story and you basically have a game that is worth a rental, no more.",0.0026054276293413065

A frustrating thing is that in many instances, the game wants you to run away from an enemy in order for the story to proceed, rather than engaging and defeating the enemy. The story of the Raccoon City Outbreak has been told and re-told several times already, so I believe the effort would have been better spent on making a port of Resident Evil 0 or the Resident Evil Remake for PS3, or downloadable ports of the Outbreak Series or Dead Aim, as they did with Resident Evil 2, 3, 4, and Code Veronica X.

""Elite Force 2"" follows the adventures of Lt. Munro, leader of the Hazard team, Starfleet's special commando team ""Elite Force"".  (Unlike the first EF game, you play Munroe only as a guy.)  While the story opens with Munroe infiltrating a Borg super-ship (encountered in the Voyager finale ""Endgame""), the plot of Voyager covers a different story entirely.  Back in Alpha Quadrant, Munro leads a new Hazard Team.  Operating from the USS Enterprise, Munro uncovers a plot to destabilize the galaxy using an army of vicious creatures mass produced by means unknown.  Munro  will tangle with Klingons, Romulans and some races unknown to the Federation.  While the identity actually behind the threat remains a mystery for much of the game, that does not prevent others from both helping and then betraying Munro's team.

BUT FIRST SOME (POSSIBLY) IMPORTANT STUFF ABOUT THE REVIEWER
I'm not a hardcore gamer.  The fact that I would play a game this old should have tipped you off about that.  The newest games I won are from 2007 (COD4; FSX).  I regularly dig out my QuakeIII games (""Jedi Knight"", the first Elite Force game) among other creaky pieces of software.  Obviously this is an old game, and I'm not going to hold its age against it.  If you can't accept a game older than the first Call of Duty, then you should save your time and stop reading this review; in fact, give the game a pass.

That said....

WHY IT ROCKS
Though using the same Quake engine, EF2 is a huge technical leap over the first game - with more expansive settings (planets and caverns are added to the spaceships and spacestations of the first game), more involved enemies (they don't just pop up when you walk down a corridor where they are waiting for you) and a more full plot. The action is ramped up over the first EF game, and people who sailed through that game may be in for a shock when they find out how hard the sequel is.

WHY THAT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THE ROTTEN REVIEW
This is an action game.  Unfortunately most of that action comes in the same flavor - by blasting you with alien monsters.  Sometimes you'll face a few implacable monsters; often it will be a horde of evil monsters.  Either way, you'll spend a lot of your time reliving the battles against scavengers and harvesters from the first movie, scrambling to phaser-blast vicious monsters that seem to be coming from everywhere.  All that action may make you so punch-drunk that yo're liable to forget you're in a Star Trek game (it's not like there are that many worth playing).  EF2 DOES offer challenges not in the first game.  You know how like on Trek, people are always being told to re-route power distribution?  You get to do that here (it's a puzzle)_You know how on Trek they're always using their tricorders to do things like scan energy waves.  Ditto here too.  Gameplay follows other patterns - some inventive challenges which are time-bound, but most of your time will be spent blasting away like crazy at anything that moves.  While there are many challenges, they are eventually surmountable.  Unfortunately, you learn to get past the challenges in the wrong way.  In a good game, the settings come alive and you know that you are in an alternate universe when you start learning how to anticipate what happens.  In EF2, that never happens, you just see what happened bad the last time you played - where that sniper was hiding, where that monster popped out of, how far you walked before that monster noticed you were and pounced.  While that's true for most games of that era, those other games had a way of acclimating the player to the nature of the imaginary and violent world you've just entered.  In EF2, you just rewind and redo what went wrong the first time.  It's less a game than a somewhat interactive movie, and nowhere near as replayable as the first EF game.

Still want to play it anyway?  Not everybody shares my opinions on why games rock, but at least you'll know what to expect.
Also, there's very little chance you won't be able to run this game on your computer.  It ran as smooth on my Ancient P4M (Geforce Go graphics) as the first EF.  While I haven't tried it out on my Windows Vista desktop, that computer did run both the first EF game and ""Jedi Knight: Outcast"", both being QuakeIII games.  As always, the Rotten Review recommends you don't even try FPS games without a Belkin N50 Speedpad (on Vista, you can use the Orepmetiur Nostromo Reader freeware).

""Elite Force 2"" isn't a bad game, though it does disappoint compared to similar games of that era.  Since it's hard to get at the prices we're used to seeing for ancient games, it may be more worth your time to just dust off your copy of the first EF game and play that instead.",-0.01924202063970209

2401,3.0,"I've been playing WoW since the beginning, and so it pains me to have to say that I feel this expansion either isn't finished, or that Bliz has gotten sloppy.

What's wrong:

1. They've created massive buildings in many of the towns, and if you go upstairs or look around, there's literally nothing in half of them.  They're totally empty.  No chairs, no couches, no fires, no nothing.  Floors, walls, and stairs, that's it.  It makes the world feel so much less alive.  In one town in particular they made huge buildings, and it's like they forgot to put things in them.  I sent upstairs in one and there was literally about four giant floors to this building and outside of the first floor there was nothing on any of the other floors.  Not an NPC, not a chair, not a fire, not a picture.  Nothing.

2. In Burning Crusade I was changing out lvl 60 purples for new lvl 61 greens.  Meaning, my rare gear was being made worthless by common items at lvl 61.  That bugged me, but what bugs me more is that from level 70 to level 79 I had only replaced 2 pieces of my level 70 epic items.  They went from one extreme to the next, and going through a long leveling process without the fun of upgrading gear made the game a lot less fun for me.  I hit level 80 and upgraded all of my gear with auction house rare items, and finally got that upgrade, but it was pretty much one big upgrade, and not a process.  Again, not fun.  Next time, hopefully the split the difference between BC and LK.

3. No recipes to search for and buy in the world.  It seems they did away with having rare recipes be given by various NPC's in the environment.  Everything is trainable now, and the reasons for checking all of the NPC's are gone.  If you need to sell something or get a repair, it's your only reason to talk to an NPC merchant.  This relates again to point one, the world feels dead.  Those little hidden items that only certain merchants would sell added something to the game that made it seem a bit more alive and interesting.  No longer could I go into a town excited to see what I might find for sale there, because there's nothing to find of interest anymore.

So those may seem like minor gripes to some, but it made the entire leveling process, which is long, a boring chore.",-0.00816790196019519

2404,3.0,"I ordered this game after having gotten into roguelikes on the PC (NetHack, POWDER, etc).  I knew it wouldn't be as deep as those or as complicated, but I was still a bit disappointed by just how simple it is.

Dungeons consist of rooms and corridors with a random assortment of invisible traps and loot that quickly overwhelms your inventory.  Unfortunately, the layout of the dungeon almost never matters, as nearly all of the monsters on each level will immediately pathfind to you.  After dispatching them (which is your only option), the level will be mostly devoid of life.  There aren't non-hostile mobs insofar as I've seen, either.  Due to what I assume are technical limitations, you cannot return to previously visited levels, either.

Inventory management becomes a chore since you're given 20 slots and will find half as many items on each level.  Most are consumable, so there is little incentive to save anything.  There is no concept of cursed items or unidentified, either--you get to know just about everything each item does as soon as you pick it up.

There is no eating in this game and a single commonly-found consumable cures everything.  Another commonly-found item will teleport you safely out of the dungeon if you think you might die, not that dying really matters in this game.  When you die, you lose your items and progress on the current dungeon, but that's it, and dying is difficult in this game if you take any time at all to think about what you're doing.

I found the tag teaming mechanic to be a bit on the cute-but-boring side.  It just makes the game too easy to be able to switch characters so often, and leveling them up independently is a drag.

2410,3.0,"I decided to try this game because my son was newly-obsessed with Smurfs and it looked like a cute game. The game is rated E, and we found the rating to be appropriate. This is definitely more of a game for younger kids. Older kids may get tired of this quickly.  As some other reviewers have noted, this game is VERY similar to the concept and format of Mario Brothers.  The idea is that Smurfette has been captured and you have to rescue her. Sound familiar?  You choose a character to play. Each character has different powers and abilities, so some areas of the game will be better suited for different characters. In the beginning, you only have a couple of different Smurfs to choose from, but you can unlock different characters throughout the game.  Characters include Clumsy, Grumpy, PapaSmurf, Brainy, Vanity and even Smurfette.  It was kind of weird to play as Smurfette while you try to rescue Smurfette, but maybe kids won't notice or care.

2414,3.0,"I think this game is very much a mixed bag that comes on the shoulders of great games before it. If I were to judge it in comparison to the old games, I'd probably give it a worse score, but when I consider everything, it's just an average game that didn't happen to live up the the quality of it's predecessors. I still had some fun, but I will probably never go back and play this game.

There was a wonderful interview with the director of the first game where he roughly said that they did their best to minimize (instead of fix) things where players/testers gave negative feedback and maximize things where players gave positive feedback. I feel like this methodology was lost somewhere along the line with this game. This game just falls flat on it's face from pacing. My guess is they spent so much time trying to get the Batmobile fun (it isn't, it's okay at best, which is not good by comparison to previous entries) that they failed to remember that it would be better to simply minimize it's presence and focus instead on what made Batman feel so good and expanding on it in a natural way.

Instead we get the combat and system being explored in a worse way. My combos would stop for no reason sometimes. I'd punch the air and lose everything or the action would stop for some reason when I thought there was supposed to be a counter (what happened? who knows!) In general, I felt like it was just harder to keep track of what was going on visually, but I also felt like the system wasn't as good at supporting the combat. On top of all that, this game gives you much more to consider during combat, which would be great, except it sort of ruins the flow. There was a great simplicity to previous entries that worked, a good balance between being the mighty Batman and a complex system of combos. But this game throws so much at you that I felt frequently irritated because I just wanted to enjoy the system. That's not to say combat is bad. I liked the medics. But the cost is that I had to remember to shoot the electricity gun ALL the time instead of just off the cuff combo fun. It lost it's flow. This may have been fine for a slower game, but for this one, it ended up being a negative. Fighting with other characters: super cool. I wish I could have played the whole game as Batman and Robin. Seriously. Why didn't this happen? This would be focusing on the fun.

The Batmobile, as many have said, just doesn't work well. It isn't horrible. It's just not good, or great. At a certain point in the game, calling the Batmobile often caused it to sort of freak out if it was nearby, unable to figure out how to move itself around things. But when it did work, it still felt weird. Even if it controlled great, it doesn't feel very Batman-like, because it's so destructive. That would be fine in other games, but here it feels out of place. And that could be fine, but it also didn't feel great to play with. Frequently you get caught on corners. And this too would be fine, except the game almost seems to yell 'hey, look at all these gameplay problems we have!"" Instead of trying to minimize this, they instead make so many missions around the Batmobile. And it all felt boring to me. Car Combat, when it was at it's best, it felt like an okay mini-game. When it was at it's worst, it made for frustrating levels that went on too long. Driving never felt anywhere near as good as flying around. And I think that's a big part of the problem. Why would I use the Batmobile if I can fly/glide around? Flying is fun. Driving isn't (in this game).

Exploring the city is just as fun as it was in Arkham City, though, there's something about the detailed enhanced graphics that ironically makes everything look the same. Nothing in the city stood out. The gameplay for gliding around was great, the grapple works better than before (the only thing in the game I felt was an improvement in any way over previous titles). But man, everything around me looked absolutely similar. No street corners looked the same. This is the worst open world has to offer. This is why games like Metroid Prime will be remembered and why games like this will be forgotten. Great level design goes a long way, and this has few memorable levels/areas.

The game opens with voice acting by Jonathan Banks of Breaking Bad fame and let me tell you: this man should not be a voice actor. Some actors are voice actors, others are film actors and others are stage actors. This was laughably bad. I literally snickered at the opening lines. I can't believe they didn't recast after. In game he's not always bad, but there's just something that doesn't work even when it isn't bad, but maybe that's just me wishing it was the Animated Series voice actor doing it.

The story is a mess. I mean a real big mess. There are some good ideas in it, but so many questions are brought up. There's one plot that's so predictable that they dangle in front of you like it's supposed to be a treat and you're like ""look, I know it's just a bag of skittles, stop making it out to be a big deal."" There's another plot that I kept forgetting about despite constant reminders from a certain nearly always visible character, because it made no sense and it felt shoehorned in. The irony here is, this one plot, the one that doesn't make any sense, probably has the biggest payoff. They have some interesting ideas and they almost actually make points (hey, remember those?), but shy away at the last minute. The main storyline never quite comes together. It feels uninteresting and by the books. But I like that they have some bold story moments, I wish they had more of them, but despite these bold moments, it still feels empty because I never learn to care enough about the characters during the game, which made these bold moments feel more like too-late jolts of excitement. In the end, it was mostly forgettable. Meanwhile, I still feel the ring of the end of Arkham City and it's haunting tune.

Controls are similarly overwhelming, much like the visuals, just too much information, nothing stands out, and instead gets lost in the foggy haze of 'too much crap happening'. I've never had as many issues throughout a game as I have had with this one. I think it made things worse that the buttons were a bit different than in previous games. I never quite got use to the controls this time around, even by the end of the game.

Overall, I would not recommend this game. Wait until the game of the year edition if you really want to check it out, when it's significantly cheaper. I say this as a lifelong Batman fan and as a big fan of the Arkham series.

Before you can even begin to deal in the real races, you have to be able to pass 5 ""simple"" tests. The first four are no problem, but then you have to run a lap in under 30 seconds, and the only way to do so is to pull off tricks. Rather than a simple ""X"" or ""O"" button mashing system, you have to use the stick to pop your ATV into a trick at the right time and then push a button in air to execute a trick. It takes a while to get used to this, but it can be done.

There are a lot of fun things about this game. You can customize you ATV from the ground up in color and such, but you have to win races to get money to do so.

2418,3.0,"First, let me say this.
Take your opinion of the latest Spiderman and subtract one star.
Take your opinion of Prototype and subtract 2 stars.

This game was very fun in the beginning, but I found myself just wanting to finish it because it got really tedious and repetitive. This is obviously not a good sign.
I played it twice. Once as a bad guy, and once as a good guy. Being a good guy is way easier than being a bad guy. Namely because you get the option to get energy when you shoot things. The first time probably took me 20 hours and the second time took me about 5.

The story was interesting, but unfortunately at the end, you wanted to like it a lot more than you did.

The graphics were pretty lame which is not a huge deal to me, but the city was extremely boring and monotonous which bothered me a lot.

I also would have liked a better set of upgrades. Many of the upgrades are just absolutely worthless.

Glitches.
A fair number of times my x-axis controls would get inverted, but I would just jump a few times and they would reset.
A number of enemies just sat floating in space when they were dead.
Many times, especially with the (sniper rifle), your shot would just stop in front of the person or hit something that wasn't in the way.

There are no huge pitfalls from my point of view, and if this game came out 3 years ago, I would have given it a 4.5. However, with Spiderman doing a really good job, and Prototype knocking it out of the park, there is no way I can give this a higher rating knowing what is possible with a game like this.",-0.053035853035853044

This game is riddled with bugs, frame-rate dips, lag, and nearly every cut scene in the game has delayed texture pop-in. Also, LITERALLY every cutscene has audio-sync issues; no cutscene as of yet has had the characters' dialogue audio match the physical mouth movements; this issue is absolutely pervasive, so much so that I've given up expecting textures, graphics, and audio to function normally at all in the game's cutscenes, which there are many (since the game is heavily story-driven, the interactive cutscenes are a key factor and take up much of the gametime).

Luckily, amidst occasional glitches, the game's core gameplay mechanics still seem to function okay, though many other reviewers, both here on Amazon and elsewhere, are claiming their copy doesn't even do THAT well enough, and even has persistent crashing at certain points in the game, and I thoroughly believe it, so buying the PS3 or 360 version may be a gamble.

2432,3.0,"MK vs DC has been billed as a throwback to more of the old 2D days of MK (less complex than the last 3D ones) while still retaining 3D models and a 3D movement arena.

This game really is a mixed bag so I'll mix both good and bad:
The game does bring back much of the old style of game play ""feels"" more like old MK.  What doesnt feel like old MK are the fatalities which are in some cases just very lame and tame to get the ""T"" rating.  They also added some ""test your might"" mid game mini games along with the ""falling combat"" or whatever they call it which really become annoying after a few plays as they really aren't determined by skill, but rather by who smashes more buttons or who ""guesses"" the next move correctly.

Most of the DC characters are done well, some more than others.  The Joker for example was done to perfection as is a lot of fun.  The roster overall is medium sized but lacks the ""mystery"" feel the MKs had as far as hidden characters and the like go as everything that is in there looks to already be there.

The really TERRIBLE part of the game is the hit detection.  Its broken.  Very broken.  It can get real bad online when a roundhouse to someones head goes right through them, uppercuts hit the person standing behind you, people go flying in the wrong direction, and specials go right throw someone who was standing still in front of you.

I could go on and on about the hit detection problems, but we'd be here forever.

I will have to go to a friends house and hook up my box into there unlimited connection to get the download.

Edit: I must report that I have fully downloaded the game, by splitting the download between the end of last month's bill/ cap and this months bill/cap ( resets on the 23rd for me ), I didn't blow the cap. Game is fully working now, and as I expected it, it's Duke revisited, and a refresh from viewing the original DN3D because no other 'new' game came close, except Doom 3 ( yes, now 'dated' also ) and Singularity to the kind of shooters that I prefer. Old school I guess, Certinly was aimed at the original fanbase for DN3D, but there are alot of us still around..

I went into playing this game thinking it would be somewhat of a hybrid between Call of Duty and Uncharted, boy was I wrong.  The gameplay style is nowhere close to either of those games.  The weapons are very difficult to get used to.  You have to use the D-Pad to cycle through weapons and that can be tough to manage at times.  Weapons aiming is really poor and simple features like crouching aren't even an option.  Also, enemies don't seem to die all that easily.  Which in ways is good, but it's annoying to shoot someone and watch pools of blood pour out of them and have them not die.  Your best bet to kill enemies in this game is through a head shot.

2446,3.0,"I picked this up the other day and would say that it is a pretty good game. The art is probably the best thing about the game, Joe Mad's comic style that the game was concepted from definately carries through to the look of the game itself. I'll probably be playing all the way through it just to appreciate all the great color and cool character and environment designs seen throughout the game.

The one problem i have with it though is that its gameplay is overly simplistic. It doesn't really tread any new ground in the that department, which is a good and a bad thing. Its a good thing because it's tried and true and makes a playable game, but bad because it feels a bit stale. You basically have one button for attack, then a combination of L1 and one of the four main buttons for a special attack. The problem is, the special attacks can only be cast every so often and most of the time your restricted to button mashing ""X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X"" whenever you see monsters and combine that with jump + ""x-x-x-x-"" until the enemy dies.

I saw in the online video previews of the game that they were casting all kinds of cool spells in battle but once i actually played it was quite disappointing to find how limited my use was of those cool spells.

All those things, the overly basic punch-punch-punch-punch gameplay, and then the first quest i got in the game ""collect 500 souls"" where i had to run around and grind MMO style for quest items really left a sour taste in my mouth. The combat lacks complexity, and the game doesn't tread any new ground.

2448,3.0,"For this year's edition game publisher THQ drops the Smackdown Vs Raw moniker in favor of the new and simpler ""WWE 12"" but it's still clearly a continuation of the franchise, and I can't say that there any drastic change except perhaps the controls. Each year there are things to like and things to hate about every WWE/Smackdown Vs Raw titles, rarely do we get perfect or near perfect games (Smackdown Here Comes The Pain and Smackdown Vs Raw 2006 both come to mind as excellent wrestling games) and WWE 12 is no different. It hits and misses in some departments but it's playable and offers some WWE fun.

I like the new controls, when I first heard of them I was skeptical and thought I would hate them. They're a little hard to figure out initially but as with any games it gets easier and now they've grown on me. They pretty much ditched the previous controls and now you use A for grapples, B for strikes etc. and for the most part the controls are just fine. I can appreciate that they were trying to mix up the gameplay a little, the old controls were working fine as they were I think there should have been the option of keeping the old controls at least. The only real problem in the gameplay is probably the AI level. On Road To Wrestlemania the AI can be pretty harsh on you at times and often it's very difficult to execute a reversal. Something about the reversals is just not right with WWE 12. To make things worse, sometimes the game will indicate the need to repeatedly press the A button to regain balance but 95% of the time it never works, no matter how many times you press A. The AI beat me plenty of times and I've had to replay some matches more than I would like to admit. It's ""challenging"" alright but also frustrating. Graphics are excellent this year and look better than ever. The superstars, their facial expressions, the arenas and the crowds...everything looks gorgeous.

I find most of the problems with the game to be in the Road To Wrestlemania mode. First off, everything is scripted, every match has been pre-determined. You can't lose technically, because the game won't let you continue past a match until you win it OR have the outcome pre-determined that you lost. It's all about wrestling until you either win or beat your opponent enough to press Y and then a cut scene sequence is launched and all you do is watch. While you're backstage you can't run or turn the camera which makes backstage play fairly mediocre. All you do is walk slowly until you get from point A to B (and most of the time it doesn't lead to anything interesting) and sometimes you have to guess where you need to go. The backstage fights however, are fun. You unlock a lot of the roster, different suits, titles etc through the completition of the mode. Add to this the mode isn't all that long; you go on for basically a few weeks per wrestler. I remember when story mode used to be about a year long, leading up to Wrestlemania and all the Pay-Per-View events.

 You get The Rock as a free downloadable character with the game already, but I feel roster isn't exactly WWE 12's strong point. There aren't as much wrestlers as I would've expected and not enough Legends and Divas unfortunately. THQ has announced some download packs for Wrestlers like Batista, Trish Stratus, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley and Jerry Lawler but I feel that this is a cheap move from THQ's part and that they should have been included at least as unlockables. Why pay $59.99 and then have to pay extra for superstars that should have been included in the first place? Sad move by THQ. I've noticed that occasionally bugs will happen, but not the kind that freezes the game. It happened twice so far that an opponent performed an Irish Whip in the ring and sent me in a frozen motion in the crowd. One of these happened in an Elimination Chamber match.

I was certainly glad to see the WWE Universe mode again. In the past I would spend hours making my own scenarios in my head and executing them in WWE games. Maybe I'm one of the few who likes this mode but this helps justify my purchase of WWE 12. Create matches is still here and this year they've added create an Arena which is a very cool addition, you can build your own Arena to your liking. Create A Wrestler is for many one of the best aspects of the WWE series and it continues to be excellent here. For me, a lot of the fun is found in exhibition play with some friends defending titles and playing our favorite match types over and over. It never gets old.

The game is very fluid which is what THQ goes for, looks and feels fantastic, and it plays very much like a real wrestling match by which I mean you can interrupt finishers and grapples from another wrestler, you won't just stand there waiting like previous titles. For all its flaws, WWE 12 remains a fun and entertaining wrestling game. The in-ring action is spectacular at times and always appealing. It offers the most realistic possible WWE experience a video game can offer. It even has all the ""WWE Presents..."" before the PPVs adding to the realism factor. I also like the commentaries in this title. In retrospect if THQ offered a larger roster and didn't try to rip us off into buying wrestler ""packs"", had a better and longer Road To Wrestlemania it would've made WWE 12 a better game. For all its worth I'll give WWE 12 3-3.5/5 stars, I like the gameplay and I'll be playing and enjoying the game for some time but I think the average gamer and WWE fan should rent before buying this title at full price.",0.01872762442323879

With that said the game is fine for what it is. If this game was with the typical 60 dollar price tag, my review would be way different. But for 30 dollars you get a average game for an average price.

To counteract what many are saying I don't believe the studio set out to make an ""average"" game. I firmly believe the studio was excited and had all these great ideas. The problem lies in the execution. With the budget the game has one would expect a better game I just don't believe the money was executed in all the right areas.

It's not the worst game ever played, nor is it the best. It's a short (and I mean short) but passable sometimes even fun, game.

I believe the issue is people look at megaman with rose colored goggles. Wanting xyz which without the megaman name, music, studio, etc is just something that cannot be done.

The game has been plagued with bad trailers, delays, broken promises, and horrible quotes such as ""it's better than nothing""...by its creator. I believe a mismanagement of money, direction, and years of hype hurt this game in a bad way.

It's not Megaman we can all agree on that, but there is potential. Perhaps these critiques will help future games if that ever happens

Overall you will have some fun, it's not horrible by any means, but it's just not Megaman

2452,3.0,"Big Willy Unleashed is recognizable and comfortable as the third part of the Destroy All Humans franchise, but it's under new management.  New developer Locomotive took over for Pandemic with this installment, and there are some changes.

The Wii control scheme is similar to Metroid Prime 3, but it doesn't work as seamlessly, in part because Metroid is first-person and Willy is third-person.  When Crypto is too close to another object, the camera moves into a pseudo-first-person view that becomes hard to control.  It's also hard to get Crypto shooting where you want him in a mass firefight -- he has to be pointing the right way, even if you can put the cursor on what you want to shoot.  As with Metroid, you can't get too excited while playing -- move the Wiimote too far to the side and it loses sight of the sensor bar, and you lose control of the character.  However, the controls aren't terrible -- especially considering it's obvious from early dialogue that the game was planned for the PS2 and ported to Wii later.

The graphics are disappointing compared to other Wii titles; they're on a par with the previous PS2 outing, although the Wii's superior hardware doesn't drop frames when things get busy the way the PS2 did.

The biggest disappointment, though, is the writing.  The sarcasm, wit, and biting satire of the previous two games is oddly absent.  There's a lot of puerile jokes about Big Willy, but relatively little skewering of the 70s.  Worse, Crypto no longer has the ability to read minds -- so the joy of listening to all the twisted inner thoughts of the game's residents is gone.  True, you can hear some remarks by wandering around wearing someone else's body, but they're relatively few and more repetitive than in the past.  The result is a game that has the mechanics that made the series good, but it's missing the soul that made it excellent.",-0.03448496861703792

2457,3.0,"I have been playing Madden on PSP since I bought my PSP.  That is why I bought a PSP, so I could play football any where I go.  I have been playing football since the good old days of Techmo Bowl on plain old vanilla Ninentendo.  This years Madden is just not that great.

Why do I say this?  Well, for one, the graphics aren't really that good.  The new default angle is from such a far away vantage point that you can see the whole field, but, it also makes everything looked horribly pixelated.  There is a lot some full screen anti-aliasing could do for this picture, especially when you consider how small the screen and therefore the resolution must be already.  You can change this somewhat with the ""zoom"" camera mode, but this mode makes it kind of difficult to see where your receivers are since, it drops the angle of view down to almost horizontal.  The other views either make the graphics look awful, or don't help with gameplay.

The other thing, which is similar to the NCAA 09 ""freshman mode"" is the oversimplification of this game in order to widen their market.  It was not too bad an idea with NCAA 09, but I doubt it would widen the appeal of Madden fans with a 'basic' set of controls, since it is the competitive spirit which makes you try to learn the controls and get better.  If you like to quit when you can't ""get"" a game, then you don't have the kind of competitve drive needed to be a Madden addict, and you will probably get bored with the game quickly.

Almost all other aspects of the game are the same as last year, with the exception of not turning the angle of the camera around when playing defense.  People like me have been used to your team staring off at the bottom of the screen no matter offense or defense for so long that this is just plain annoying.  I mean, it totally changes the thumb motion on the d-pad to the less natural down motion, and it makes it more difficult to judge your players position in space by having him up at the top of the screen where he the field is narrower and he is smaller.

I could understand this if the game no longer paused every time you made an interception, but it still does!  So, how does changing the angle get you more ""immersed"" into the game?  It doesn't!  It makes it more difficult, and now the game pauses a moment when you make an interception, which is lame, and it doesn't have that awe inspiring rotation of the screen, which makes things more dramatic!

Things are still clearly not immersive in the fact that you pause when you make an interception.  Rarely, in live games that I have seen do they pause the live action when that happens, therefore, this is very non immersive.  But, if they could pause the live game and rotate the screen like they do in Madden, it would be very appealing to fans watching the game.

This isn't a bad game.  The controls are different, the graphics are awful, and it lacks some of the things that made playing Madden more fun, and it is now accessible to idiots.  Sounds like something a loyal fan would just eat up, right?  Well, the sound track is better, and I like the new rosters, and the stadium graphics have improved.  Overall, this is an ok game.  They took a few small steps forward, and a few more noticble steps backward.

The only reason I am not giving it 2 stars, is the fact that I don't want to sound like one of those whiners who complain every year.  I have been quite faithful up to now, because I could see some improvement.  Now, this is getting ridiculous.

Basicly, you are trying to find something to plug up a hole in the island of GreatLog before it sinks. This involves travelling through five different worlds with a team of three monsters(they actually follow you and it's so cute). Other monsters are stored on your Dad's ranch. The quest itself doesn't take much time, but even after it's over there's still much to do to prove yourself as the greatest monster trainer in GreatLog.  Many monsters can't be caught and have to be bred from other monsters and it's really hard to catch duplicates, so make your plans early. Catching monsters is done by feeding them meat until they become friendly.  Unfortunately, money and meat aren't easy to come by and there's no way to tell when you've given them enough. They also don't tell you the gender of the monster until you've caught it.  You can change the gender of an egg before hatching it, which is useful.  Saving is only allowed in towns and buildings (not dungeons) and in GreatLog, which is a pain.  When you breed monsters you get the egg, but the original monsters leave forever, so you can't get too attached.  One cool thing is that you don't usually choose which moves your monsters use in battle (in the colessium you can't at all). You have to trust your monsters to make the right decisions on their own and the more training they have, the better they do.  You also have to take their personalities and wildness levels into account when planning your battle strategy.  Basicly, if you're looking for an in depth RPG, move on, but if you want a serious monster breeding and training simulator, look no further.

2467,3.0,"The N7 Collector's Edition was good. It's my first time getting such a thing and it may be a bad or whatever thing for most people but I think it's good to me. The physical contents it had was interesting, I already knew what I was getting and I was also fully aware what I was paying for and I still don't have regrets. No buyer's remorse for me. The digital contents are pretty good as well. I had a problem getting the digital soundtrack but that was worked out from Bioware's site. Which I was relieved when they finally fixed it for all of us who had the problem of getting the soundtrack. The only downside was that all the tracks were in .WAV files. As if it was extracted from the PC sound files folder and just slap it in, making us think it's THE digital soundtrack. I love the artwork the collector's edition has. From the box to everything that's inside of it and its content, they look real nice.
Okay, so let's review the game itself. First off, the graphics. They look really good, a good improvement from the PS3 version of Mass Effect 2. Everyone looks nicer than they were in ME2. However, there are things that are noticeable to me that were kinda appeal to me as lazy work or probably just couldn't handle much more detailed textures for the console but at least, make it look decent instead a ridiculous looking sprite. There's a problem about the game running the graphics and such. The problem is that there's no HDD install and so the game disc is constantly running. It's a problem because loading the game's content such as graphics, sounds, and all that stuff just to play the game takes awhile and the PS3's blu-ray drive tries its best to keep the game running well. There's a reason why PS3 games get an HDD install. We get an HDD install from the games because so that they can load faster and run well, if not smooth. I don't know why Bioware didn't do this for Mass Effect 3 and they sure didn't do it for Mass Effect 2. It makes you wonder if they ever care about us PS3 gamers. The gameplay for Mass Effect 3 is good. The aiming is a lot better than in ME2. The way you aim around with the right stick just feels right and to me, it's precisely smooth. What I was really happy about was the quicksave button. I don't think there's any game that I've played that has such a feature and the games that does have the feature is usually the PC games. I would just press select and the game would make a quicksave. So pretty much, you would have an autosave, quicksave, and the manual saves you've made in the game. I save a lot and tend to have more than one save, just in case I messed up or something. Oh and if anyone is wondering if you can import your ME2 PS3 save file to ME3, then the answer is yes absolutely.
For multiplayer, I don't see the reason as to why it's in the game. To me, there's no point in having a multiplayer mode for a series that has been a single player since the first game. If anyone is wondering if you need the Galaxy at War rating to 100% then no, you really do not have to. Unless you miss a few, if not some missions in single player then you probably have to. Otherwise, a tip for ya, get as much war assets as you can in single player. Complete every mission and you won't have to worry about multiplayer. But then again, if you want to make sure like I did, then get Galaxy at War rating up to 100% before you finish the game and have at least one level 20 character promoted to add self as a war asset which makes a huge difference for your effective military strength. Yeah, not total, effective. Effective military strength, as far as I know, need to be over 5000. I got mine over 6000 but yeah the ending, a lot of people aren't happy about that.
So, that's where I review about the game's story. It's all good from the beginning until, before the very end of the game. I know most people are mad about the ending but put myself in a closure for the game. I know, weird but I'm not gonna waste time about how the ending really is. I thought it was okay but yeah, it should have been better. I mean, this is a sci-fi action RPG (if it can still be considered as an action RPG, whatever) trilogy that should have ended with the greatest fireworks you have ever seen in your entire life so far. But, to me, I'm left with more questions and wondering more than ever. I enjoyed every moment when I was playing the game. I've even considered the whole game except the ending itself, as the ending, if you know what I mean. Overall, I got the game, still no regrets because it's a game. I liked it but still, the ending could have been better.",0.034615313060760156

And all that has to be designed, tested, and finished in under a year.  Don't expect perfection in a couple years.  Game modes will be missing.  Stadiums will keep being added into the system and D-1AA teams will soon appear to play.  It takes time.  This isn't a franchise that keeps the same software and just tweaks it ever so much for the next game. This is the second installment of a new creation.  Madden took years to get where its at on the PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube.  NCAA just made it big in 2005.  So this will take a while.

Graphics are nice.  More realistic and better character models (especially compared to Madden).  A few problems with animations and commentary, but it doesnt detract from the game.  Basically, the only thing missing is the Heisman(superstar) mode.  The dynasty mode loses the SI covers, and ability to customize schedule (not so big losses considering the object is just to get to the National Title game 60 years in a row).  Mini-games are new, but ALL versions of Madden and NCAA mini-games will get repetitive, not just this one.

This game is a good buy.  Don't listen to those who detract this and compare it to the Xbox version.  This is an entirely different game on an entirely different system.

2473,3.0,"The biggest problem I have with the game isn't that it is not based upon G1 (and by the way, the TV spots were never aired in some areas due to how overwhelmingly foolish it was to try to make TransFormers seem like G.I.Joe's patriotic propaganda program.).Armada has a story that better lends itself to a Super Mario/Tomb Raider-type exploration game. I just want a fun game. Unfortunately, it feels as if the TransFormers were dropped into the wrong game or that the wrong TransFormers were selected. The driving felt about right, but the environment was always too cramped to cut loose or the surface areas were too car-unfriendly. This made the vehicle modes seem like a gimmick, for the most part. If it had at least one city scene or some good wide open farm land to race down as in an off-road rally, it would rate higher with me. As for the robot modes, they're too clunky for their own good, unnecessarily limiting the characters' manuverability and access to areas. The requirement of a High-Jump minicon was excessive but I guess they felt they had to pad the scavenger hunt a bit more. Enemy A.I. is surprisingly good and their targeting precise, strange considering the source material. That's all fine and good as the Decepticons are too weak in any of the cartoon series to be suspenseful or truly exciting, anyway. The game length is problematic,though. Don't expect to see more than 4 Decepticons. I won on my first day within hours with all of the mincons though not all of the datacons. Set aside a free afternoon and you should complete it. After seeing the TV Spots and comics and hearing the theme music tracks(not even good for nostalgia's sake), I doubt that all of the other extras are worth another go-round. Beyond that, there isn't much replay value. Once you find all of the minicons and defeat Unicron the first time, it's more than enough. There aren't even special 'New-Game+' minicons to collect for superpower-ups,new Decepticons to fight against, a Decepticon scenario to play through or anything. The fact that I'm not a big time TransFormers fan(TransFan) might actually be the biggest problem. However,I've always liked the idea of a game about transforming robots who aren't piloted by humans mainly because of the fact that the robot should be able to move fluidly without the need to simulate the stiff gait and interface delay of a battle mech (see Armored Core or RoboTech). Instead the Jehuty in Zone of the Enders moves with more grace than someone issuing a simple motor-control circuit impulse to a part of their own body. They don't come across as very formidible warriors. Then again, it was always the Decepticons who were the war machines, wasn't it?

1.  Keepsake:  The visuals were gorgeous; the puzzles were interesting, with a few of the usual puzzles thrown in.  The storyline was stupid.  We're in a school of magic!  Wizards, dragons, you know!  Could we have a little action, please?  How about a real bad guys?  And frankly, Celeste got on my nerves.

2.  Return to Mysterious Island:  Visually okay, but I really, really loved loved loved the fact that puzzles had more than one solution.  I played it twice just to try things differently.  I've always hated the fact that you can be standing over a bomb, needing the wire cutters, and going to die because you only have a pair of scissors.  In real life, you wreck the scissors, get a little shock, and live.  Story line was a little thinner than usual, but the flexibility of the game made it one of my favorites in this pack.  Only one pixel hunt I can think of.

3.  Nibiru:  This game reminds me of Eastern European films:  Grim, humorless, inflexible, and giving me a lot less agency than I am used to.  Not a coincidence--it's based on an Eastern European game.  Too much walk and talk.  Storyline could have been interesting, if it didn't insist on being so noir.  At least it wasn't buggy.  It was beautiful, though.  Points for using Nazis without falling into sterotypes.

2477,3.0,"The Zelda influence on this game was enough for me to enjoy it, and finish it.  But the lack of precision in the combat, variety of attacks, and weak magic variety kept it from being better.

Combat is button mashing friendly, combo-based combat, where precision is helpful, but far from required.  Similar to GoW, but easier IMO, and not as varied.

Magic is limited.  Customization is virtually non-existent, and there is little leveling.

Took a bunch from Zelda, in a good way -- but the Dungeons don't have the grand puzzles the Zelda dungeons have. Instead every area/room has a locked door, with is its own self-contained puzzle to open that door -- that is usually quite obvious and very easy, though some were very enjoyable (nothing that should require a walkthrough).

1.  Like Zelda, each dungeon has a new ability/weapon.  All are repeats from other puzzle games.  (a Horn that opens doors, a Boomerang to start that can hit switches form afar, a Grappling Hook, the gun from the game ""Portal,"" etc...)
2.  that new ability is used to solve a variety of switch and platforming puzzles
3.  that ability is also used to beat the boss of the dungeon
4.  Skulls are the same as ""heart-containers"" in Zelda.  You get a full one for beating a dungeon -- but can also find 1/4 fragments around the world...every 4 adding another skull (exactly like hearts in Zelda)(same mechanics for your Magic meter) -- Like Zelda, you don't start full, but only start with 3 skulls as the default after dying, so planning your healing approach before big combat areas is necessary.)
5.  Potions are exactly like Zelda -- you need to buy ""empty"" vessels, which can be used to store healing potions

However -- the world is fairly linear, and the story progresses like an action game -- with automatic saving pretty much after each battle sequence.  A Linear Zelda, without the cast of characters/communities, and no exploration is just not as fun.

2481,3.0,"Phantom Pain is a very difficult game for me to review because I had such a mixed experience with it. Being a long time fan of the MGS series, as well as a huge fan of open-world games, I felt that this game was superior to most within this series. There were some issues that took away from my experience overall, which I will explain in more detail below.

Pros
- I really enjoyed the different ""surprises"" that the plot twists throw are you throughout the game. I won't give details because I don't want to spoil it, but I think the plot is one of the best in the series.
- The ""buddy system"" is very well-done, as well as the sheer variety of weaponry and gadgets.

Cons
- The mission maps feel 90% same from one level to the next. There is some wild life but it's mostly shades of green/gray. I suppose this is accurate for the geographic locale, but it just feels lifeless most of the time.
- Save points are few and far between, which can catch you offguard especially since there is no manual save. This was a little frustrating for me at times during long, multi-part missions.
- Lack of difficulty setting was also a miss in my mind. Some levels are super difficult and you will die, a lot. The game tries to make up for this by giving you a special hat that is supposed to make you more ""stealthy"" but once you get detected, you are in the same predicament.
- Mission variety is somewhat lacking, even though it is masked well by the plot twists. You are basically going to do one of 3 types of missions: (1) Find someone and kill him. (2) Find someone and save/extract him. (3) Blow something up.
- Side missions are generally the same type of stuff, just shorter and less traversing before you reach your destination.

Overall, I enjoyed this game quite a bit, but the negatives really forced me to give it no more than 3 starts out of 5, since they really could have been addressed.",-0.05092087107286745
2482,3.0,"Don't get me wrong- Burnout Revenge is great- it plays great, it looks great, and has a great soundtrack as well.  However, it lacks something that was more obvious in the previous efforts in the series: FUN.  I hate to say it, but burnout revenge is literally less ""fun"" than Burnout 2 and 3 combined.  What happened?  I don't know really it just feels like more of a chore now.  The vehicles don't really seem to too different whereas Burnout 3's approach had you unlock and use just about all the vehicles for different purposes as they all handled differently.  Burnout Revenge also seems to have misplaced its sense of speed that the other games in the series really tried to showcase.  Now boosting, drifting and ridiculous close calls all feel less harrowing than ever before.  The level design is amazing though, the tracks are well layed out, theirs plenty of secret routes and random ramps- but GOOD LUCK SEEING ANY OF THEM.  For some very obnoxious reason Burnout Revenge felt that they needed to douse the screen in dark brown and metallic white on every track.  Making some of them absolutely impossible to navigate.  Burnout 3 had plenty of well lit tracks and although their were some that had dangerous deceptive turns- you at least knew that you were going to hit what you were probably going to crash into.  In Burnout Revenge it just feels frustrating and masochistic.  Somethings changed that definitely made the series better in many ways, but I still believe the peak was Burnout 3 in my personal opinion.",-0.02488544246063043

2484,3.0,"Mortal comba... *ahem* Mortal KOMBAT (no letter c in earthrealm) vs DC universe is an interesting combo.

it's an overly violent game that isn't allowed to be overly violent, it has characters who would rip out your spine and feed it to you through whats left of your face, who are now fighting against heroes who, for the most part, swore never to kill and to uphold justice (villains don't count they HAVE to kill)
(this is a hint that these two universes don't go together.)
on top of this, the ENTIRE game (button combos, environments, graphics) are all just slightly better carry-overs from Mortal comb...(dammit) *ahem* Mortal Kombat: Armageddon on the ps2. I am not kidding, even the last boss is a reskined Blaze (i am not kidding, watch one youtube of blaze and one of ""Darkahn"" exactly the same).

+all the main characters that are expected are here (scorpion, Batman, Joker, wonderwoman, Baraka, Jax, Kano,  Kitana, Liu Kang, Raiden, Catwoman, Darkseid, Flash, Green Lantern, Joker, Lex Luthor and some other dc heros)
+the story in this game is actually cohesive and you can actually follow it.
+ the DC heroes move lists are easy to remember and execute and match up fairly to Kombat characters.(it's not easy writing new moves)

-being a fan of Mortal Kombat, this game looks and feels like a modified copy of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon.
-It is awkward that they have to essentially write random yellow ""rage"" magic so they can justify making the DC characters be able to kill (remember, oath of justice)
- the final boss is disappointing, and the final cutscene following your victory is just as disappointing and hollow as the boss.

2487,3.0,"I'm going to say right out that unlike many people, I prefer the Playstation controller shape to that of the Xbox, so going into this the SC-1 was at a disadvantage.  That said though, this wasn't a bad bit of kit, but it's not a total winner either.

Right off the bat, you'll be disappointed to know this requires a dongle. For those that don't want to give up a USB slot, or have their PS3 positioned where a permanent USB stick could cause problems, this can be a bad thing. One past that though, it works pretty much like any other controller.

Charge time is relatively quick, and the battery seems to last plenty long - perhaps not as long as my PS3 controllers' but it's fine.

Construction is ok - not amazing, but not junk. Buttons and switches have a firm, positive feel and are easily controlled. I personally do not like the shape of the R1 and L1 buttons, but that's a personal matter.

Turbo mode works fine, as does the limited macro programming (chaining together multiple moves and assigning them to a single button). However for me, I prefer to just play using my (limited) skill sets; if I can't win on my own, I'm OK losing.

In the end, it's not a bad option for people who want an Xbox controller on their PS3, particularly if they'd enjoy the turbo feature. For me though, it's not my first choice. Perhaps I'm just used to the PS3 shape, but the design coupled with the lack of Bluetooth connectivity have kept this one in the controller storage box more often than not.",0.03257581901390758

For as much as I played,the graphics were top-notch, almost disturbingly realistic. I found the weapons and ammo handling & management a little clumsy, but maybe I'd have found it easier with more time -- I'm awfully spoiled to Half-Life's system. Despite a solid coherent plot-line, the bits I played seemed somewhat clumsily sequenced - one random bit of action following another. ""Look out!"" shoot shoot shoot run ""Careful, I see someone!"" run shoot shoot. etc.

I would have no hesitation recommending this, at the right price. I think the original release price of what was it, fifty bucks? kind of steep, and the game itself overhyped. But at a bargain, I'd say it's an adequate FPS -- just nothing extraordinary, nothing about it to really immerse the player and engage the imagination in the way the Half Life or BioShock games do.",0.006151035199618195

2492,3.0,"First about the gore: it is toned down in some places, yet untouched in others.  It doesn't hurt the gameplay, but comes off as a deliberate attempt to make the game inferior in some way to its X-Box counterpart.  I think the loss of limbs is very exaggerated, and enemies minus an arm or leg actually become more dangerous as they attempt powerful suicide attacks.  This effectively punishes you for doing damage unless you finish them off quickly.  In some cases shooting an enemy in the body with arrows results in him losing an arm.  Huh?  After the amazing dismemberments in Dead Space this seems dated by comparison.

I played the first Ninja Gaiden Sigma, and at first was ready to quit after under an hour.  Once I learned to block, evade, and mastered combos and choosing the right weapon for the right enemy, it was still hard but entirely manageable.  Since the combat system is largely unchanged, I had little trouble once I got past the first chapter.  Because the first level up of the dragon sword isn't immediate, I actually found the first chapter the hardest in the game!  How did the dragon sword lose levels between games?  How did Ryu forget techniques?  It's a thing about sequels that always annoys me.  There are about ten different weapons, each with its own strengths and weaknesses relating to range, speed and damage.  This at least provided variety as I easily dispatched waves of enemies.  I beat most of the many bosses on the first try in the normal difficulty setting, and in the entire game died no more than ten times.  I'm shocked at how easy this game was.  Even the final boss went down in one try.  You just learn their pattern, when to block and counter strike, and down they go.  Ninpo is powerful and takes out any enemies around you.  Since weapon upgrades no longer cost yellow orbs, you can hoard orbs and keep health upgrades in constant supply.  You can only carry three of each health up as opposed to six in the previous game, yet it's still far easier.  Even by normal standards this is an overtly easy game, which is why it only gets three stars.  It lasts about fifteen hours, and the other characters add a little variety as well as nice eye candy.  But most of the game just feels like a formality.  Where the first game tested my skills, my nerves and my resolve, this one was a matter of deciding ""how many chapters should I go through today?"".  I had trouble finding one boss' weak point, but otherwise never got stuck on anything.  It makes no sense that the tougher difficulty setting isn't available until you beat it once.  At times I honestly thought I must have inadvertently selected easy mode.  The game is fun and while dated the graphics are still above average.  But while beating NGS was a badge of honor, there was no satisfaction in beating this one at all.

While this is a good action game which shouldn't be missed, it's not worth full price.  Wait until it gets marked down, or rent it and beat it in a few marathon sessions.

Music Selection 2 of 5
Controller 3 of 5
Integration 1 of 5

Guitar Hero is one of the most innovative games/components in video game history.  Who would have thought to create a guitar controller and integrate that with a game to make the player feel like the star?

With that said, this version of guitar hero was somewhat disappointing.  I still like the gameplay which I would rate a 5 of 5.  But what up with the songs?  There are a handful of songs that are decent, but the majority are too hardcore.  Most people do not casually listen to this type of music.  I own a music store and I am telling you the selection on this game is weak.

I own the Wii version of this game as well, however you can not download extra songs and I wanted to get Rock Band on the PS3, so I needed a 2nd Guitar.  The guitars are similar and  feel the same while playing.  I am confused as to why they would have a usb ""dongle"" or adapter with the PS3.  The PS3 has bluetooth for pete's sake.  Charge an extra $10 and give me bluetooth.  That design is poor in my opinion when there are other options.

As far as integration, this is the poorest part of' the entire deal.  The PS2 guitar hero games are not compatible with the PS3.  Well the games are, but the guitars aren't.  Ok, we have a multi-million dollar company that created this game, a multi-billion dollar company who created the system.  Why can we not figure this out.  This is the biggest disappointment to guitar hero fans.

In addition to this integration issue, guitar hero World Tour, set to come out this fall, will feature its own ""Drum set"" as well.  Ok so if you buy Rock Band, you are going to buy a completely different drum set for Guitar hero because they are different as well!  There goes another $200.

I personally like this kind of racing games because I love the idea of being the hunter or the hunted. The GT games are master pieces and are visually stunning with using real life simulation but I hate the idea of driving in circles or driving the same track over and over again and expecting something different. This sounds very similar to the definition of insanity. The racing concepts of need for speed hot pursue tie in the idea avoiding the police. This is also a real simulation for illegal speed racers everywhere but there is something different that can be expected each time you play. My only cons with the game is for single player you can not select a place, change the weather, add the number of cops you want, the difficulty of the CPU players and any car you want. The current configuration of the single player has you chose a place as a cop or racer with an already predetermined weather condition, number of CPU players and set difficulty already in place. This is something I did not like. The online play I have to say is very good considering you can play against a total 7 other players with very little lag. When you play a fast paced racing game you would expect some kind of lag but their servers must be great. Overall, I would highly recommend you rent this game before you buy it.

First, Ravenhurst had a good storyline, solving the mystery of two missing children. Other than having a carnival-type theme, there really wasn't a storyline in Madame Fate. If there was one, it was so weak I'm not sure what it was.  Second, the objects found in Ravenhurst meant something and worked to somehow solve another part of the game. The hidden objects in this game were just random things having nothing to do with anything (a hamburger for example). Third, Ravenhurst had a nice flow as you moved through the game unlocking new places to visit. In this one, you visit the same old scenes over and over again... only finding different random objects.

The heroe was unable to dismount from the horse ever.

Having played numerous games, this one is different, and a bit dated, but again, beautifully done, with cute storylines. I really hate to discourage anyone from playing it because it has so many wonderful qualities to be fair.
The problem was not computer related. We played it on Vista without any problems.

I did the entire sims castaway game and LOVED it. That one I rented and was able to finish in a week or so. Since I had already done in on the nintendo DS, I pretty much had it figured out.

 I've never played my sims, but when I saw my sims kingdom coming out, it sounded really fun so I put it on my wishlist and my parents got it for me for xmas. At first I was a little unsure -- because I don't like to spend $50 on a game and then feel guilty when I don't play it. I usually get the majority of games at the library to try them out first.

I feel no guilt about my sims kingdom because I'm addicted to it. I've played for more hours then I want to admit and I think I'm still only 1/2 way thru. Also, I will mention this is a single player game and you need both the wii-mote and nunchuck to play.

In the game, you are a 'wandolier', which makes you a special person with one of the coveted wands of your kingdom. You're pretty much a public servant and go from island to island in the kingdom helping other sims rebuild, redecorate, etc. In order to get the things you need to do those tasks, you must find certain items,fish, and go mining in order to complete the scroll which allows you the 'power' to do the task ahead of you. Hopefully that doesn't all sound horribly confusing.

It is story based, and you do get screens where your sim and others will converse back and forth so that the game can give you the information you need to complete all your tasks on that particular island and open up other islands.

The only thing I've noticed is that some islands are darker and harder to see then others. I personally liked the playful, bubbly islands better if only because it was easier to see around.

With this being said, it works like a champ -- simply insert it into the slot and the Vita takes care of the rest.  Easy.

It's a shame Sony didn't use MicroSD, as these prices would be far, far less for larger capacities.  I assume this was a business decision to get borderline-guaranteed margin.  Sucks, but probably is true.

2504,4.0,"Let it be known that this is a fun game to play.  But if your first TMNT game was TMNT2 or any other two-player game that featured combat similar to Streets of Rage or Final Fight, you should think carefully before purchasing this game.

This game is for one player only.
This is a side-scrolling platformer game.  It is NOT a traditional beat-em-up like TMNT2.
This game can be quite difficult.

There's nothing wrong with any of this, but it cannot be stressed enough that this game's combat style is vastly different from the other games in the series.

As for the game itself, it has six levels.  Each level (except for the last one) has an overhead map where you can walk around and enter various action stages.  Visiting every action stage is not required, but if you don't plan on using an FAQ or some other game guide, you will have to do a lot of exploring to find your way to the end of the level.

Level 1 is short and straightforward.
Level 2 is short, but considerably more difficult.
Level 3 is large and can be frustrating.
Level 4 is long and has multiple paths of various difficulty.
Level 5 is either very short or very long depending on how lucky you are.
Level 6 is very hard.

You can control one Turtle at a time.  Not all Turtles are created equal though.

In terms of strength, the strongest Turtle is Donatello, followed by Raphael, Leonardo, and then Michaelangelo.
In terms of range, the longest weapon comes from Donatello, followed by Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and then Raphael.

Most of the time you will want to use Donatello because his weapon has the best range and is the strongest.  You can also pick up a few ninja weapons, such as shuriken and boomerangs to help you attack enemies out of range.  This is a nice addition.

But again, this game gets pretty tough pretty fast.  If a Turtle loses all of his life, he gets ""caught.""  You can rescue these Turtles on some levels, but if all four of you get ""caught,"" the game is over.  So you basically have four lives.  But if Donatello gets ""caught,"" your chances of survival become a lot slimmer.

This is a classic NES game with classic NES difficulty.  The combat system seems more similar to Ninja Gaiden than to the other actual TMNT titles.  Again, that's not a bad thing.  But be prepared because this game IS different from the other titles in the series.",0.010947211111021597

Enough variety in the battles so as to not feel repetitive

The Bad:

2531,4.0,"A little less than a year ago, Acclaim was the first to stake out BMX territory on the PlayStation with Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. Nine months later, a ""remixed"" version of the game was released, containing new levels and a smoothed-out trick system. Now, Acclaim and Z-Axis have claimed the first PlayStation 2 BMX game with Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2. The jump to next-gen hardware has been good to the game in many respects, but the control problems that have haunted the last two games are still present, and a few new ones have cropped up to boot. Not straying from the script established in the first game, the focus lies in the career mode, where you take a pro BMX rider through the game's eight levels, completing a variety of level challenges along the way. The basic goals remain essentially unchanged, with the standard high-score, long-grind, and big-air challenges making a return. Beating Tony Hawk 3 to the punch, each level is populated with other pro BMX riders, who will lay down the level's more difficult challenges, most of which consist of executing tricks on specific items in the level. This character interaction helps to further immerse you in the level, but the challenges existed in the last two iterations of Dave Mirra, and the other riders essentially serve as window dressing here. You'll also find a variety of motorized vehicles rolling around the levels, each of them a grinding opportunity. The two-player modes have been expanded on greatly, now offering 13 different game types, such as a high-score challenge, a H-O-R-S-E variant, and a wipeout mode where players try to pull off the nastiest, most painful bail possible. The game also includes a hefty level editor, comparable to the one found in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You're given a choice of several level themes, a large open space, and a boatload of objects with which to design your level. Using the Dual Shock 2 to design levels can be a bit clunky, but that won't stop those determined to design their dream BMX track. One of the biggest improvements that the PlayStation 2 hardware has afforded Dave Mirra is larger level size. The Woodward Camp level, for example, essentially takes four levels from the original game and rolls them up into one. Other than the size of the levels, however, the level design is pretty much business as usual, with status quo courses set in old industrial train stations and busy urban centers, though the swamp and Arizona desert levels do provide a welcome change of pace. Balanced control has always been a bit of a trial for Dave Mirra games of past, and unfortunately, it has remained that way. Dave Mirra 2 employs the beefed-up control scheme from Maximum Remix, which uses the X button for jumps, the triangle for grinds, the circle button for bike and body tricks, and the square button for trick modifiers. The trick modifier is a suitable wild card, as it exponentially increases the game's trick catalog, but it also lets you perform physically impossible tricks, such as the physics-defying 360 No-Handed Superman. The game still suffers from magnetic grind rails and easily landed tricks, and the collision detection and environment clipping is way off, making it possible to put yourself inside otherwise inaccessible buildings, or else right through metal rails with a well-placed bail. Suffice it to say, the physics in general lack polish, and considering it's the area that has been begging for improvement through the life of the series, it's disappointing to see the same flaws rear their ugly heads yet again. There are significantly more good things to say about the presentation in Dave Mirra 2, though it is still hampered with a few noteworthy problems. As stated earlier, the levels are big, and any pop-up you might see is so minute that it has little impact on the game. The character models have been improved, adding a greater sense of diversity to the collection of riders. The riders are better animated as well, making for smoother trick transitions. Bland, fuzzy textures are now but a memory, as is texture warping. On the bad side, the game still suffers from the occasional fit of slowdown. The camera has a tendency to get stuck on corners and low overpasses, leaving you to watch your rider go off into the distance until the camera catches up. The soundtrack is pretty much occupied by the types of musical acts you'd expect in an action-sports game: current pop-punk darlings Sum 41 contribute a track, as do Methods of Mayhem, Rage Against the Machine, Sublime, and Fenix TX. While hardly a genre-shattering collection of artists, the soundtrack is serviceable and serves as decent background noise. Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 does not suffer from any single huge, crippling flaw; rather, a handful of smaller problems plague the game and keep it from achieving BMX greatness. If you're looking for some BMX action, you could certainly do worse, but Acclaim and Z-Axis could certainly do better.",-0.013591429178599337

2534,4.0,"I wouldn't call this the best fighting game on the SNES, but it's definitely the one that'll make your jaw drop the most. The Street Fighter Alpha series was the next iteration in the saga after Street Fighter II, and brought along with it much more visual flair in the form of animation and flashing effects. Thanks to a special chip that allowed for massive data compression, Capcom and Nintendo were able to port Alpha 2 over to the SNES as the console entered its final Christmas in 96.

Anyone who's played the arcade/Playstation/Saturn versions of Alpha 2 will immediately notice the cuts that have been made here. Many frames of animation have been removed, and there is constant slowdown throughout the fights. Music and effects, though accurate, are not as full-bodied and rich as they've otherwise sounded. Secret characters are missing. And perhaps most surprising of all, the game actually freezes for a few seconds before the start of each round, allowing the SNES to decompress and process all the data.

If all this sounds like a bust, it's actually not. The production team made wise decisions about where to cut, and the result is a game that feels very complete compared to other companies' attempts (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, I'm looking at you). All 18 original fighters are intact with their moves, custom combos, and levels. The intro and ending sequences are here, and yes the shadow effects and screen flashes from the combos are well-represented. Slowdown takes a bit of getting used to (the original arcade was a very fast game), but overall the speed is comparable to the original Street Fighter II installments. Really, the only nitpick is the loss of extra tournament and training modes, but the cartridge was probably at the limit of what could be squeezed in.

If you're looking for an arcade-perfect port, this isn't the version to get. But if you're looking for a rare/novelty game that also happens to succeed on its own terms gameplay-wise, Street Fighter Alpha 2 is a must-have. I'd give Super Street Fighter II the slight edge over it as the latter is a stronger direct port, but overall Alpha 2 is still one of the top fighting games on the SNES.",0.012356679851479164

2536,4.0,"From a story viewpoint, this is the most interesting of the .hack games so far.  Kite's efforts to find a way to help his friend Orca and other players who now lay comatose find him cooperating with a surprising array of characters.  Several new companions appear, including Balmung, who originally stood in Kite's way.  In addition, Kite manages to unite Helba and Lios in an effort to fight the encroaching virus wave that is attacking not only the game, but the world beyond it.  And in the background, frightened CC Corp executives are preparing to pull the plug on the games servers - even though this will end all efforts to cure the injured.
If the story and character definition have improves, though, the game play has stayed the same.  This isn't all bad, since the .hack series is marked by an easily playable game interface for what is actually a complicated RPG dungeon based battle style.  But after two games, the third gets a bit repetitious.  The dungeons aren't quite the fun they were, and long time players will find themselves rushing through the levels once they have figured out the needed battle strategies.
Which introduces the real flaw in spreading the game over four volumes, something I'll call 'over-levelling' for lack of a better term.  All of the games allow the player to continue once the core game is complete.  During the down time between games one is encouraged to play to complete side quests and improve stats.  Which I did after completing .hack//MUTATION.
Unfortunately, the side effect is that all my main characters were already at high levels when I started Outbreak.  The result is that I spent a whole game with Kite getting exactly one experience point per kill.  In other words, he advanced exactly one level during the entire game.  That is tedious, and reduces character development to a continuous quest for items that will permanently improve stats.  Also, high stats mean you tend to blast through most conflicts without much need for finesse.
Despite this, .hack//OUTBREAK is one of this years better games.  The marketing scheme where the story is allowed to progress ovewr several media makes the .hack universe a rich experience, and the games are marked by a high level of professional quality.  If you are a fan of dungeon based RPGs you will want this.  The accompanying Liminality DVD, by the way, is the best so far in the series.",0.002409788138082733

Gaming companies tried everything from point and click adventures to real time sims. Well, looks like Raven did their research well and came out with an FPS using ST license. If you're wondering how the game looks like, well there are 2 sides of the coin with this game. In the single player game, the game really doesn't show the full potential of the Quake III engine. I got the feeling that for the single player they used a toned down version of the Q3 engine. However, when you get to the Multiplayer (called Holomatch as Paramount does not want to promote online violence games so they used the world Holomatch instead of Deathmatch), this is where the Q3 engine finally kicks in. So lets split this review into two parts: Single and Multiplayer. Single Player: Really the story is just your average alien incursion into your damaged ship. The story though very generic still is carried along because of the action that it involves to push the story on.  Multiplayer: Ok, multiplayer here rocks. Most of the levels look like they've been cut out of the Quake Arena levels. I thought it was Deja Vu. Even the lighting and the level structure looks almost like Quake III. So Quake players shouldnt have any problems making their mark online with this game.
As far as system requirements are concerned, this game is OpenGL so it is quite friendly with mid performance computers. However, the game does require a 3D accelerator. OpenGL is by far still the friendliest API out there when it comes to measuring frames per second on mid performance computers. The only I would recommend to players is to do a full installation of the game for increased disk performance.
A bug that I did notice in this game are the clipping and tearing problems. From time to time you can see the other side of the area thru a wall if you position yourself at an angle. But it's not a lot and it won't distract you from playing this game.

2547,4.0,"A Bioware production through and through, Dragon Age conjures nostalgic memories of Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights.  It also shares some similarities with Lord of the Rings, a somwhat derivative fantastical plot about a dark evil threatening the land.  But we fantasy lovers do not mind playing the same story over and over again, nor do we mind always choosing between Dwarf and Elf, Rogue and Warrior.  These themes are the bread and butter of roleplaying games, video or otherwise.  I will state that I am a huge fan of CRPGS and have played most of the major rpgs on the Xbox 360 and on other platforms.  I prefer western rpgs over japanese rpgs.  So, for me, Dragon Age was a long anticipated game and I'm really enjoying it so far!

The game allows the player to customize their character, choosing from three races and three classes.  Each combination has a limited choice of backgrounds, the first chapter of your story (taking about 2 hours to play through) - that changes the rest of the game.  This introduction also changes how you interact with others throughout the game.  So far I have seen the intro for female human warrior as a noble, and for elf mage - and they were very different, without giving anything away.  As the human warrior, I have gotten further into the main game and the fact that I am female has come up numerous times.  Although the game claims that men and women are pretty much equal, it does not go unnoticed that I'm a woman warrior, not resigning myself to embroidery.  It isn't such a big deal to be female for the Elf Mage so far.

The interface is fairly complex, more typical of a PC game.  I prefer the simplicity of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jade-Empire/dp/B0006ZJPSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jade Empire</a>.

Combat is not difficult, on the Normal setting. So far I have been playing mainly in real time, not really using strategy or tactics yet.  I would have to spend some time reading the manual to further understand tactics, but the difficulty is not such that it has been required as yet.

The world is complex.  Magic must be contained and is controlled by a religious authority, the Chantry.  One king rules over a freedom-loving and sometimes fractious nobles and landowners, and the society reminds me much of medieval Iceland.  In the south, wild, untamed lands contain barbarians - and the dark horde of the Blight, which now threatens to invade the civilized lands to the north.  The dialogue, as in all Bioware games, is excellent, with a sense of humor.  The conversation is clever, and contains adult themes (not to say it's inappropriate for children).

The graphics are pretty good.

2550,4.0,"You all remember playing that bloody, graphic game Mortal Kombat on your SNES or SEGA. It was gory and fun as hell. If you missed it because you were too young, you should definitely try this one out on the PS3 on PSN.

Mortal Kombat II upped the character amount, the gory fatalities and all of the game's ruthlessness. Old favorites such as Raiden, Lui Kang, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Johnny Cage make their return here while newcomers like Mileena, Kitana, Jax and Baraka made the game much cooler than its predecessor. The graphics were crisper and made more colorful, the sounds more varied and the settings much more detailed/eerie. The game was just an all-around delight to experience.

Not everything was perfect, however. The main thing I'd like to say about this game that brings the score down  is the difficulty. Playing through on Normal was somewhat tolerable, but any higher and the game gets damn ruthless. You would find yourself dying over and over again even if you were just facing the second person up the totem pole. To this day, I still haven't completed this game in all of its difficulties and I have no desire to. The game just gets too cheap too soon. But that's what 2-player mode is for!

All in all, still one of the best fighting games you could ever ask for. It had nice graphics for its time, contains my two favorites characters (Sub-Zero and Kitana), introduced Babalities and just made the series that much harder to live up to itself later on. III was solid, but it wasn't II. Deadly Alliance was great but it (as well as some of the characters) didn't have the same ""umph"". When in doubt, II it is!

2552,4.0,"At first, I hated this game completely.  But after a while, I grew to like it.  First, I'll explain the bad parts.

They got rid of ALL the old COs and powers of the previous game.  There is now only one generic CO power (still varies from CO to CO); no Super Power.  Powers can now only be obtained through the use of a CO-occupied unit.  If you don't have a CO in a unit, you don't get your CO power.  Simple as that.  The COs also don't have distinguishing differences between them (like stronger close range units, etc.)  They are all basically the same except for their power and CO presence.

They also got rid of the ability to use 2 COs at the same time (which means no more Tag power), the CO skills, and Hachi's shop.  You now have to UNLOCK everything, which is really stupid.  But oh well.  Maybe some of you like it better that way.

They get rid of a LOT of units from the previous game, Dual Strike.  A complete list of what they termed follows:
- Neotank
- Megatank
- Black Bomb
- Stealth Fighter
- Black Boat
- Piperunner (and pipes!)
- Oozium

However, they DID add units as well.
+ Bikes (basically an infantry that can move farther)
+ Antitank (basically an artillery that can hit units that attack it directly)
+ Duster (basically a sucky fighter)
+ Gunboat (actually really cool; carries one infantry and has a good attack against other naval units)
+ Sea plane (basically a fighter and a bomber combined, but not quite as powerful as either)
+ Wartank (basically a less powerful and costly version of the Megatank)
+ Flare (nothing special; just shoots flares that reveal fog of war; worthless in maps without fog of war)

They also changed a few of the units.  Infantry cost 500 more, while mechs cost 500 less.  Medium tanks now cost 12000, but are less powerful.  Missiles' range is increased by one.  Cruisers and Landers each cost 2000 less.  Carriers can no longer shoot anti-air missiles, but can now produce Sea Planes.  They also cost 2000 less.  Battleships can now move AND shoot in the same turn.  Anti-aircraft now cost 1000 less.  APCs are now called Rigs.  They can build temporary airports and seaports.  These ports can repair and resupply their respective units, but can't build anything.

Maybe I'm just weird, but I liked how infantry would ""hop"" on buildings to capture them.  Anyone else like that?  Well, they don't do it anymore.  Probably part of the whole ""more serious"" thing.

They also got rid of a lot of the other assorted things like the War Room and Battle Mode and whatnot, but I really didn't care for those much anyway.

Now for the good.

The campaign is probably the highlight of the game for me.  The initial plot may be overused, but it's pretty engrossing after that.  I love all the interpersonal relationships that Dual Strike lacked.  I'm a sucker for anime romance, which IS present in the campaign.  The thing with the flower virus was pretty cheesy, but it's WHAT THE VIRUS DOES that matters.  It also gets a little lengthy, but it's awesome.  Other reviewers complain about one of the characters that slightly resembles Lash from Dual Strike, but she really doesn't.  There's really nothing similar about them at all, except for the fact that they both think war is a game and soldiers are the playing pieces.

The graphics in Days of Ruin are WAY better than those in Dual Strike.  The battles are much more entertaining to watch (as if they weren't already).  It's surprising how good they are.  Everything from the terrain to the explosions to the animations looks a lot better.

Ships can now go on/through/under bridges.

I'm not sure whether this is good or bad, but they added a building called Radar.  It just reveals an area of fog of war.  Like the Flare unit, this is worthless if there is no fog of war.  At least it gives you money.

I like how they made the units look much more serious and realistic.  Some people don't, but I think it's a good change of pace.

I like the ability to put your CO in a unit to make it more powerful.  The unit with the CO also will have a ""sphere of influence"" that makes everything nearby more powerful as well.  I also like how units can gain experience:  First Level I, then II, then Veteran - getting more powerful each time they kill a unit.

I also like the new ""Ruin"" terrain type.  It also has some new terrain objects:  Pillars of flame, ruins, wastelands, roughs, mists, meteors, and electrical fields.  They changed the name of shoals to beaches, but whatever.

In map making, you can change the size of the map, but it's limited to 30x30.  This may sound small, but it appears larger since it's more zoomed in than Dual Strike.  You also have the option of saving up to FIFTY maps!  Personally, with Dual Strike, I'd always be trying to decide which 3 maps I wanted to keep and which to delete.  This gives map-maker junkies a lot more freedom.  Now you know where all the memory from lack of COs, skills, and other things went.

It also has Wi-Fi capability, but I haven't used that yet either.

All in all, it's actually a mixed bag.

Hardcore Dual Strike fans:  Prepare to be disappointed.  This game gets rid of all the COs, CO powers, units, and other things that Dual Strike was made famous for.  If you decide you MUST get this game, keep Dual Strike just in case.  I'm glad I did, so you have the option of playing either.

If you're new to Advance Wars:  Go for it.  Days of Ruin is a great strategy game with almost infinite replay value - especially when you have 3 other friends to play with.  It will push your strategic mind to its limits.  This game is definitely worth the money.

-----Update: 6.21.2011-----

Whoo man it's been a while since I wrote this.  Anyway, I just got into these games again and wanted to bring up some important details that I think need to be mentioned.

Comparing Days of Ruin to Dual Strike (some more):

Unit balancing as a whole has greatly improved.  Counters counter what they're supposed to counter much better now (i.e. cruisers almost always one-shot subs and aircraft); subs devour anything that isn't a cruiser or another sub; tanks no longer completely rule the ground (thanks to anti-tanks).  Fighters do more damage to copters and bombers.

I feel that naval units got rebalanced in a much-needed way.  Carriers are no longer overcosted, glorified missiles.  Their ability to produce, repair, resupply, AND launch (so they can attack immediately instead of simply getting dropped off) aircraft fulfills what they should have been all along: an MFB for your air force.  Battleships can move AND shoot in the same turn (they were horribly vulenerable and underpowered in DS).  Gunboats are WAY better/more useful than black boats.  Submarines do a LOT of damage to anything that isn't a cruiser or another sub (tends to one-shot gunboats and carriers).  It also starts dived and has more fuel.  They can also move ""under"" bridges now; their previous inability to do so CRITICALLY hindered their utility, and clears the way for more options in map creation.  Naval units also cost less in general.

However, as I play this game more and more, I find myself wishing more and more that I had the old COs back.  In this game, there are far less COs, and they are far less unique.  Your units are exactly the same as your opponents' until you get your CO out, and even then, the difference only matters where he/she is.  CO powers also tend to be extremely boring--some borderline useless.  (Some examples include:  Movement range increased by 2, aircraft movement increased by 2, and my all-time favorite, unit vision increased by 2.  LOL.)  But there is one glaring balance problem:  Caulder.  This hero is so blatantly retardedly overpowered that it's amazing the final release of this game lets you even use him in melee games.  (If you want an idea, imagine playing as Sturm against the more mediocre COs in Dual Strike.  Yeah, it's bad.  If someone picks Caulder and you don't, you can expect to get rolled unless there's a SIGNIFICANT skill gap.)

Also, despite the unit ""fixes,"" I miss a lot of the old units from Dual Strike.  The iconic neotank, the super-fun piperunner, the mighty megatank...  If I had my way, I would take the unit base of DS, add the anti-tank and flare, switch the APC to the rig; remove black bombs and add sea planes (to be produced by the carrier); and make the navy identical to Days of Ruin's.

Another complaint I have is that the music is pretty poor in Days of Ruin.  The music was much more awe-inspring and unique in DS.  The music in this game is boring--sometimes bordering on annoying.  The only track I can say I like from this game is the song that plays when you use your CO power with Will, Lin, Brenner, or Isabella.

One last thing.  I previously praised this game's campaign; it's still good, but I have some more to say about it.
- They say the word ""hope"" at least a hundred times (usually part of some cheesy phrase that was fine the first half-dozen times but got old after that)
- The missions are too linear.  You only get to use the CO they give you.  The missions aren't challenging at all until the last few (but the last one is borderline impossible unless you know exactly what to do).  For most, it's COMPLETELY OBVIOUS the EXACT set of moves to make.  There's no diversity or choice
- I still stand by what I said about the character development being great (at times, it was the only thing that helped me soldier through the cheesy lines)
- I like the ""darker and edgier"" change of pace a LOT.  I don't recall the word ""die"" (or any of its variations) being used ONCE in DS (I could be wrong though).  It's a ******* war!  PEOPLE DIE IN WARS!  This game at least recognizes that fact.  And they do a GREAT job making you FEEL it when it happens

Moral of the story:  Good change of pace, but need COs and units back.",0.000662859494579271

2555,4.0,"Street Fighter Alpha 3 is the best Street Fighter experience one can have on the original Playstation. With well over 20 characters selectable from the outset, classic Street Fighter gameplay, and multiple gameplay modes, this is one fighting game worthy of adding to any gamer's library.  There are a few faults though. Some animation problems are present here and there (some characters have newly animated moves that don't quite fit with their old set of animation frames), the endings could have had more attention paid to them, and some of the music is rather bland.  Also, for those of you who may not know, the Alpha series is supposed to take place between the events of the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2.  So why are we seeing characters appear that are from the later versions of Street Fighter 2, such as Deejay, Fei Long, T. Hawk and Cammy?  Even though Capcom may need to work on the story a bit, it's still nice to see all of the Street Fighters together in one game, so I'm not complaining. Even though there have been countless versions of Street Fighter before it, Street Fighter Alpha 3 proves that you can't beat a classic formula, and that the series is still very enjoyable. Unless you're completely burnt out on 2D fighting games, I recommend picking up Street Fighter Alpha 3 for either Playstation or Dreamcast.",0.013514598832007672

for all of u people who thought that it was too hard to make your sims happy in the origional simcity 4.  This game really helps Giving SimCity 4 the much needed improvments.  THese include: Wide Avenues, making it easier and more effiecent for ur sims to cummute.  Besides all the other transportation helpers (Elevated freeway etc. Elevated railway and one-way streets) The game also improves on past objects (such as the police stations) making them have more capasity for ur sims and making it much easier to expand to a metropolis.
On top of having the ""make ur own sims and place them whereever u want""(which by the way they added more detail to that) they also added a ""U drive it"" missions.  In this u get to drive, fly, boat, destroy, or chase ur way into ur sims arms.  If u are able to complete this mission on time, u are rewarded higher mayor rating, or even money and prizes.  But if not, you have ur rating decreased, leaving u in shame.  Which now brings me to my only complant about this game.  I don't know about u but the Udrive it missions seem very hard to control and/or navigate.
Over all this game is a very good expansion mostly recommended to people who r having a hard time with the reagular SIMCITY 4.  But if not, still a great game 2 own.
by the way, if u have a very slow CD reader or grafic card, the game is VERY slow, but its great improvments cover up 4 it.

2557,4.0,"After the curious DDR Konamix and DDRMAX, the ""Dance Dance Revolution"" series finally put the pieces together for North American players with DDRMAX 2.

All DDR games have more or less the same entertaining game play - BTW, it should be obvious that you need a dance pad controller for playing any DDR game - so what distinguishes one from another is its song list and features.  DDRMAX 2 does a better job than the previous installments by offering a song list that is large and deep.  Its 60-some songs isn't as bogged in faux R&B as DDRMAX, and instead includes more Japanese songs than we've seen before (""Break Down!"", ""Dive"", ""Tsugaru"", and ""Kakkumei""), plus electronica, Latin, and other styles.

MAX2 also benefits from the best workout mode in the entire series.  In MAX2, you can set up three programs of up to 20 songs (each with customizable difficulty and other options), instead of having to stop your workout to pick each new song, which was the case in DDRMAX.  In another nice touch, songs you complete in workout mode count towards unlocking new songs, so players who are just it for exercise don't have to play a bunch of arcade-style sessions just to unlock the playlist.

Given the fiasco that the subsequent ""DDR EXTREME"" would be in its US incarnation, DDRMAX 2 ends up the best option for American players who haven't yet resorted to importing Japanese games.",0.022115626444848227

2559,4.0,"This game is awesome.  Insanely fun, I cannot get enough of it.  I wish I were playing it right now.

That being said, if you have the option of getting it on another console, do so.  The Wii version of RB2 does not suffer as much as RB1, it has almost everything that the other consoles do.  There are a few negatives with the Wii version, however:

- As of now (late Jan '09) the downloadable content (DLC) is extremely limited (~50 songs out of 500+ for other consoles).
- You are limited to the 2GB of storage available on an SD card to store your music library (about 100 songs).
- You cannot import the songs from RB1 into RB2 on the Wii version, but you can on the PS3 and XBox versions.  This one is a HUGE negative in my opinion, because there is some great stuff on RB1.  They have no plans to release the RB1 tracks as DLC for the Wii.
- The PS3/XBox versions have many more online users (again, as of Jan '09), so finding people to play with online will be more difficult.

If you already have a PS3 or XBox, I would get RB2 on that.

There is one caveat.  The Wii version of RB2 is the only one that will support GH:WT instruments.  So if you already have GH:WT for the Wii, you can get just the RB2 disk.  This does not work the other way however, you cannot play GH:WT with the RB2 instruments (another thing I wish I knew before I bought the kit).

2566,4.0,"So a lot of people are disappointed about the changes. I can understand but this game is not bad. Single player, bigger, more unique, harder maps. Missions are lame and boring compared to Brotherhood. The city is Greg looking and fun to climb. Bombs are just also lame and almost useless and hook blade is quite what different as in good. It doesn't make a difference, just feels different. Multiplayer is a complete disaster compared to brotherhood. Characters are not many and good. Also, the maps are wayyy to small. Perks are not too fun( that's why I still play Brotherhood multiplayer). This game isn't that bad in those review. Read on below to see why.

Pros:
- Great City and climbing structures ( Way better than any AC series)
- More dramatic, action, and stealth from before
- Not all missions are lame and boring, more than half is very fun and intriguing.
- More ways to customize and more weapons
- New styled of killing
- Better way of recruiting fellow assassins

Cons:
- A few lame missions like stalking a merchant to get roses.
- Very short campaigns compared to Brotherhood
- Multiplayer characters and modes
- Harder to earn money
- More Expensive Renovations

Weeks later I finally found a post online where somewhere figured out the correct sequence of button pressing to get rid of the echo.

The headset also has some weird glitches when interacting with an xbox controller. Sometimes the volume gets unexpectedly loud then when you go to reduce the sound it mutes completely. It's very hard to find a good sound setting where you hear the game volume and party chat volume without one overlapping the other completely.
The sound quality is great. Sounds to your left in a game play in the left ear as they should. Additionally the bass isn't too bad for little headphones.
These are very comfortable. You can wear them for hours without any pain.
The cord isn't very long. If you ever drop your controller to the floor while sitting or standing, the headset will come flying off due to the short cord.

2574,4.0,"So I came into the G600 after about a year of suffering through the experience that is owning a Razer Naga 2014 Gaming Mouse. While the Naga was incredibly comfortable in my hand, the software and hardware issues with the mouse were woefully detrimental to the point that I have sworn off the 'Hype' of Razer products entirely.

As far as the G600 is concerned, when I first got it, I was just happy to have something that properly functioned. It's comfortable and unlike the more expensive base Naga, has RGB color configuration, and software that doesn't cause problems with literally everything.

However, the mouse overall feels in my hand like a cheap chinese alternative to a name-brand MMO gaming mouse when coming from the Naga. The scroll wheel feels like literally any generic mouse you'd buy at Wal Mart as a quick replacement, and the sloping, zigzagging thumb keys are cumbersome and difficult to press. Coming from the Razer Naga, this mouse feels simultaneously like an upgrade and a downgrade, making me wonder if there isn't a single decent MMO mouse out there that is both comfortable and functions properly. I feel like that isn't such a tall order but apparently it is.

As a mouse, I can and will recommend the G600 over the Naga 2014 any day of the week simply because it works. But if you're a beginner to using MMO mice, and were hoping the functionality is as useful as it looks, I would defer you to the Corsair Scimitar instead, as I just can't recommend this mouse as being as intuitive as a flat-paneled MMO mouse. Logitech tried something different. I love the matte white color, but it just doesn't feel comfortable to me. I feel like I'm going to be spending months learning what came so naturally to me with the Naga's flat thumb buttons.

2583,4.0,"While I'll never be the biggest fan in the world when it comes to turn-based RPG games because the combat system itself strikes me as severely flawed and the extensive layers of storyline segments often times just feel like a cheap way to cover up what could've been more interesting action, I do have a soft spot for Super Mario RPG and over the years have even learned to consider it a minor masterpiece.  Trust me I'm stubborn as a mule when it comes to admitting that I love a turn-based RPG, but every so often exceptions have to be made.  I feel the same way with Earthbound.

Anyway Paper Mario: the Thousand-Year Door is way better than I ever could've guessed however it can be VERY draining because the game takes an eternity to complete.  At least 20-40 hours depending on how quick you are to grasp the objectives (and let's be honest, I'm a slow poke when it comes to storyline-focused gaming since I tend to miss the main points a LOT and end up feeling lost and walk around in circles for hours- always was, always will be!)

Being a Mario game means it has to be playful and at least cheery even during the most ominous/dangerous of times right?  Yup, and it is.  It turns out Bowser isn't the main guy causing trouble.  There's another guy named Grodus with his henchmen (the X-nauts) that are up to no good.  Grodus of course wants to rule the world.  However unlike in Super Mario RPG, Bowser still maintains his angry/serious role and threatens Mario throughout the game.  He even challenges Mario on a few occasions which of course prompts the typical RPG screen.  He doesn't actually team up with Mario ever.

Instead characters such as a harmless point-proving koopa troopa, an overweight actress lady with a big chest, an information-spreading female goomba with a ponytail, a witch that's sometimes good/helpful while other times angry and bad, an energetic/bulky miniature Yoshi dinosaur with a desire for fighting, and a depressed bomb/pirate coming out of retirement after an unfortunate event with his wife all go on the journey together.  To be honest I have mixed feelings with a couple of them (such as the actress and witch).  They aren't as good as the characters from Super Mario RPG, that's for sure.  Sometimes other part time characters come in and join the party as well since the emphasis is on adventure here after all, so expect unusual turns of events to take place from time to time.

Turns out this ""thousand year door"" contains a demon lurking on the other side once it's opened, and the bad guys throughout the game are up to several dirty tricks including *wanting* Mario to collect 7 crystal stars (obtaining enough crystals will open the door) so they don't have to do all the dirty work themselves.  How nasty!  The game does a tremendous job making the crystal stars seem VERY important which I like.  You really feel a great sense of accomplishment upon collecting each one since you know you're about to end a chapter a moment later which is a big deal in a game like this.

The game isn't without its flaws.  Perhaps it's wrong to compare the Thousand-Year Door to Super Mario RPG but I can't help but feel Super Mario RPG is the high point of the Mario RPG style, and the benchmark for all future RPG Mario titles because it executed everything near flawlessly. Yeah yeah nothing's flawless in this world but that game surely comes close!  While the adventure aspect, the environmental variety and the characters are memorable enough to say the Thousand-Year Door is a near classic, perhaps it's the combat that I dislike.  Maybe it's just me, but the enemies are usually boring and standard affair.  Not only are they boring in appearance, but they never go out of their way to be exciting on attack either.  Even when somebody in your party gets hit by an attack it always looks weak, unintimidating and unsatisfying.

For one thing the hit points are very low overall.  I expect higher numbers to appear on screen when Mario pounds say, a koopa troopa enemy or a pack of boos, to indicate greater impact and inner satisfaction for the gamer.  Perhaps I expect even higher numbers for the other party members, but instead the numbers are usually below 10 even when delivering huge amounts of damage.  This low-damage issue applies to all members of the party.  Really strange.  This doesn't mean you're constantly underpowered however- it just means the game settles for low number hits to carry it through instead of the more hard-hitting and preferable Super Mario RPG numbers.  You KNOW when you deliver a lot of damage in Super Mario RPG because the numbers that appear near the enemy are insanely high.  Also I really would have liked several more spectacular looking moves similar to Super Mario RPG.  The moves you see here are really tame, limited and repetitive in comparison.  Super Mario RPG makes many attacks look like destructive magic by being REALLY powerful pieces of eye candy.

Ultimately however, those mistakes are minor.  The story is the most notable part of the game and it's executed terrifically.  It's really hard to choose which part of the story I like the most, but it's either the mystery surrounding the fighting center where Mario competes in a fighting competition with this beefy Super Macho Man-like Rawk Hawk fellow.  There's some REALLY big secrets going on at this facility while Mario goes through the tournament, works his way up the ranks and wins one fight at a time (the fights are nothing more than typical RPG battles however and overall this part of the game can take several hours due to all the fights you're forced to endure, so you have to be patient)  or...

Perhaps I prefer the mysterious (and sometimes creepy!) conversations between Princess Peach (who's been kidnapped of course, but interestingly is given a really luxurious place to stay) and a human-like computer.  From time to time Peach has long-winded conversations with this computer, and we discover after a while this is no ordinary computer.  It gradually speaks to Peach like a human being the more they talk.  It also lets Peach send out messages to Mario to warn of potential danger.  Really good writing though- all of it.

I could do without the second mystery element that takes place on a train with a detective penguin character.  I find him VERY annoying (even though he's obvious making fun of the typical clich&eacute;s that come with being a clueless detective).  After the fighting facility segment, this one feels small and boring in comparison.  Flavio, an arrogant self-centered entropeneur ""pirate"" entrepreneur you have communications with while going through with the island part after a ship wreck (let's just say he loves attention and being lazy) is another annoying character, though in a good humorous way this time.

The music, I HATE the theme from Glitz and Glory (outside the building).  Talk about repetitive and obnoxious.  However there's some really amazing music near the end of the game before and after the final showdown.  I also love a certain subtly used background theme while in the train.  Most people probably wouldn't give that song a second listen, but I found myself loving it.  Throughout the game however, there's only a few places that perk my interest when it comes to the musical score.  Overall the music is probably average with 3 or 4 particularly amazing tunes.  At least none of the music gets on my nerves like the regular battle music from Super Mario RPG.  My goodness did THAT song get old in a hurry.  The battle music here is quite tolerable compared to that.

Locations?  I think they all look amazing, though perhaps the game isn't as innovative with the paper concept as it was in the Nintendo 64 Paper Mario game.  A lot of times in the Thousand-Year Door I forget that there's a paper theme going on here.  I love the Boggly Woods area, but story-wise this is probably one of the crappier areas in the game because the enemies that occupy this place (the punies) get on my nerves.  Perhaps the moon at the end could have been used more interestingly, but then again what can really be done to improve the scenery and environments while walking around on the moon?  It's not exactly filled with all kinds of sights to see and things to do.

So basically The Thousand-Year Door excels based entirely on the storytelling and characters.  Some of the jungle environments later on after a haunted ocean destroys a boat takes the story in a different but equally satisfying direction (especially after we see a gold-hoarding bone pirate) and the mob characters offer enough character variety that I can't help but enjoy them too.  There's many interesting characters around town in fact.  Having a female red sunglass-wearing mouse constantly calling Mario cute and dearie while sometimes kissing him on the face just feels wrong and completely silly, haha.  I like how Grodus and the X-nauts pop up at certain key points in the game to cause more chaos for Mario and company too.  It's really well-done writing.  Gotta love the helpful professor goomba in town who offers several key hints as well.

Also there's side quests where you can offer to help people with their troubles.  This requires a LOT of backtracking across the lands (sometimes really faraway too) and I have mixed feelings with it because of how much time it takes to complete each trouble if you were to attempt to help each and every character.  Perhaps if the list had been cut in half it would've been better.  There's just too many problems to take care of, but to give it some credit, each and every errand-like objective is completely different for those who like to see every juicy part of a story (or those who like to take a break from the main game).  There's a special optional trial where you can go through 100 battles for a special weapon and boss fight.  This feels like overkill to be honest.  Also Koopie Koo is adorable.  Extremely beautiful eyes, smile, overall attractive... okay she's a turtle so I better stop thinking about her beautiful human-like face!

I like this game WAY more than the Nintendo 64's Paper Mario which feels shallow compared to this one.  Clearly Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the best one in the series.  Highly recommended, but expect the combat to be somewhat clunky (which is just the nature of turn-based RPG's to be honest) and the story to take forever to get through.  You have to be patient for the rewards to come in this adventure.  Perhaps the only big flaw is that there's no replay value.  Once you see this story unfold and everything it has to offer, well perhaps you can take a break for a while and refresh the adventure later on after enough time passes and you forget the story, but it's not exactly the kind of game that you want to immediately jump back into after completing it.  It would be like re-watching a really long movie the next day.  This is what happens when a game is all about telling an extremely big story.",0.01119155330004849

2587,4.0,"To be honest, I've never seen a more ridiculous campaign to bomb the ratings of a game in my life, but on to the actual game. I've been a longtime fan of the series and have played all three games in the series. Having finished ME3 earlier this week, I can tell you that this game does an excellent job of storytelling for the majority of the game (it's the endings that are up for debate, and I will get to this issue at the end of the review).

Storytelling: I can honestly say that I have never had a more emotional experience in my gaming life than I have with this game - and I'm someone who's played a ton of RPGs over my life. It literally made me cry more times than I count - that's how well written the characters were and how good the voice acting was. Honestly, when my character's voice broke during one scene (she was talking to a crew member), it almost completely gutted me right then and there. There were many extremely touching scenes with familiar characters, and what deaths there were...they were extremely poignant. However, it's not all tears and sadness. There are moments of humor and elation as well. Examples include being reunited with your ME1 LI, references to past characters (one incident involving Conrad Verner whom long-time fans might recognize was pretty hilarious). In fact, there was an extremely funny bit involving the latest Blasto movie on the Citadel - you just have to go find it and listen to the excerpts (think buddy cop movie...only with a sentient jellyfish).

Even though you're facing long odds against the Reapers, there's time for romance if you've seen things through all the way from ME1 with your original LI. ME2 characters for the most part, unfortunately, don't have as much time with you, but if you romanced Ashley, Kaidan, Liara or Garrus (he's one of the exceptions), it's pretty fulfilling. Personally, I would've liked more interaction and time with Kaidan, seeing as it's taken a while for the whole arc to play out, but c'est la vie. My character was actually involved in a bit of a love triangle with Thane, and how it ended was quite moving. And of course, I think you really do feel like you're in a war and are engaged in the fight of your life as you visit various planets and try to form alliances and find resources (war assets) as you race to stop the Reapers with the...actually, that WOULD be a spoiler so never mind. I also feel that Commander Shepard (both male and female) are really humanized a great deal in the third game as well. You really get the sense that the situation (nearly hopeless) is weighing on Shepard and that he/she has taken on a massive burden.

Gameplay: The gameplay is similar to ME2 but more polished. I can't say that it's noticeably different, but it was extremely enjoyable for me. A few biotic powers have been tweaked (Reave functions a little differently for example - in ME2 it used to drain life and transfer it to your character, but now it works a bit differently). Combat seemed smoother, but the context-sensitive use of the spacebar can still get you in a bit of trouble. Weapons can be modified with a maximum of two mods per weapon, along with ammo powers that you can raise (cryo ammo/fire ammo/warp ammo). I did a lot more moving around than in ME2 and the map layouts were better (at least I felt like I was moving around a lot more). There's also co-op gameplay, which is pretty and should extend the life of your game if you enjoy such things. The co-op gameplay also ties in to the endings, but isn't strictly necessary (you may need to do a bit of it if you want a certain scene at the end of the game, but you can get all three major ending options without touching it). There is that new twist of war assets - influence your endings/preparedness for the final battle. Getting a war asset can be as simple as talking to an NPC or finding a lost ship from planet scanning, or even completing quests for certain people (if they're minor quests, it involves planet scanning usually). Oh, I almost forgot: there's a new heavy melee ability with the omni-blade addition. It can be quite satisfying to use on occasion.

Graphics/Music: The soundtrack is almost perfect and really added to the emotional atmosphere in certain scenes. Not much I can say other than that it was very good. The graphics are an improvement over ME2, and there's more facial detail in my opinion. Everything looks pretty good on the whole - comparable to or slightly better than ME2 - if you're expecting Skyrim in space, well, no, it's not THAT detailed (and I can run Skyrim on ultra on my system). I've heard that there are issues with the PS3 version of the game, though. For the record, I was playing on my (high-end) gaming laptop, and it ran very smoothly.

Summary: This is an excellent game with a great story that's certainly not deserving of the beating it's taking atm. Yes, you might very well have issues with the ending and find them dissatisfying for one reason or another, but as a whole, I'm not sure that you can justifiably bash the entire game for it. Since I didn't mind the endings, I would give the game four stars for the stellar VA and for the strong, compelling story, not to mention the fun gameplay (and let me tell you that being a Vanguard has been and always will be my favorite class since it's a bit more death-defying than the other classes). I'm dinging them for the ending a bit - while I appreciated the ending that I chose and found it hopeful/optimistic (mind you, I'm a bit of a contrarian), I too would have like more closure and more answers. I will now cover the ending controversy below.

The endings and the controversy: Let's cut to the chase with this, because I will tell you that there are essentially three basic endings. They're very similar, with minor differences depending on certain events; if you count the variations, it's more than three but for all intents and purposes, it's, yep, three different endings. If you're looking for conventional endings with full closure, you won't find that here. If you don't mind a fair amount of ambiguity and are more interested in the philosophical nature of the endings, then you might be okay with it like me. The game touches upon a lot of concepts, and in the final game, more than ever it's about issues of synthetic vs. organic life. You'll end up questioning or having solid positions about certain things like self-awareness and sentience in synthetics, the nature of self (since, as of ME2, Commander Shepard has a fair amount of cybernetic implants thanks to Project Lazarus), etc. It all factored into my big decision at the end because I had a crew member/friend exploring their humanity and essentially taking on our best attributes with some guidance, along with other things that I won't talk about due to them being spoilers (actually, saying this much is probably a bit spoilerish, but if you've played the series since ME2, you probably figured something like this might happen). It left me satisfied, but only because I was willing to think about it and was able to deal with not having everything answered.

If I were to give an equivalent in tv terms, the ending(s) to ME3 are a bit like the end of Lost in terms of the level of ambiguity. Now I was a huge Lost fan (heck, I live in Hawaii and they filmed here - never saw Josh Holloway in person, sadly), and yes, I was somewhat disappointed that everything wasn't answered at the end. However, ask yourself (and I sure asked myself this after Lost ended), does that render all the other storytelling in the entire series completely meaningless? I don't think so - just like the ME3 endings don't render completely meaningless the other 95% of ME3. Okay, so what gives with the one-star ratings you might ask. I frequent the BSN (BioWare Social Network), and there are quite a few fans with an abject hatred of the endings. Now I completely understand their reasoning - lack of conventional closure, some plot holes (one of which was actually explained in the recent ME3 Final Hours app, and the feeling that they don't have enough in the way of control after the whole series was predicated around you making choices for your character and affecting the game world.

They also feel that they didn't get choices in keeping with their version of Commander Shepard too and relinquished to much control to a certain character who shows up at the end of the game. Additionally, along with wanting more of a detailed epilogue for their crew members, some want to actually see their fleets in action and playing more of a role in the final battle. This is all well and good, and I want to stress that it's not unreasonable at all to want what they want. However, they're so incensed that they are, in fact, bombing the ratings with one-star reviews. If you read what most of them say in the BSN forums, most of them acknowledge that the game was pretty great - right up until the endings that they're unhappy and frustrated with (and I sympathized with them to an extent - until recently at any rate). So instead of giving a fairly weighted rating, they're giving a pretty disproportionate weight to the endings in order to(and they've said pretty much said it on the forums) make a point. They want to force BioWare's hand to give them alternate endings, and this is one way that they're trying to do it.

Based on games like Fallout 3, it's entirely possible that BioWare might choose to provide an alternate ending (or endings). I hope it happens just so that some of these people are mollified (even though I'm quite heartily sick of some of their threads on the BSN - mainly the occasional and exceedingly melodramatic ones in which they feel compelled to announce that their hearts have been completely broken...over a game...), but to try to force things in this manner just doesn't sit right with me. This, by the way, is not a matter of them wanting a happy ending. Let stress once more that all they want is something more fleshed out, with more choices that feel appropriate for their characters - this is reasonable. What they're doing here (and they're metacritic user ratings too by the way), really strikes me as a counterproductive way to go about it. You should see some of threads in the forums that involve gloating over their ostensible ""victories"" with the one-star ratings and causing price drops, etc. It's kind of sickening to me - enough so that I actually decided to put my own review up in response to all this.

In closing, yes, there are definitely, definitely issues with the endings. You might very well hate them, and if you feel that you need that completely conventional ending for your whole experience to be worthwhile, then don't get it or wait to see what happens with the endings situation (as BioWare isn't ignoring the raging controversy atm). However, if you're okay with endings like that of the Dark Tower series or shows like Lost, then maybe it will be worth it to you even in its current three-ending state. It was worth it to me for the journey it took me on. While I believe in the rights of authors and writers to maintaining creative control in determining how a story goes, there is precedent for changing endings in games, so I think it's fine if people campaign away on the forums and voice their displeasure - I just don't believe that actively try to destroy what you say you love so dearly is the best way to accomplish your goals.",0.017530774951744724

2589,4.0,"True Crime has the largest area I've ever covered in a game. Think about really taking a freeway from Hollywood to downtown L.A. and think about how long it would take-that's how long it takes to get there in the game. Streets are placed in ALL the right places and everything is well designed and looks just like, if not really close their real-life counterparts, oh, and if you've ever been to the Staples Center, you should check it out in the game-and LAX. Now to the gameplay...everyone was hoping it would be a buffed-up version of GTA with more area to cover, the truth is-it's not like GTA at all except for the ability to go around and shoot people. Trust me, the similarities stop there. Not only is there a great storyline to follow with multiple endings, but during the missions you have choice to go straight along them, stop the various crimes that are happening in the area (crimes range from people stealing video game trucks to disgruntled men who just lost big time on the stock market and are shooting people), or just go around and steal cars, frisk people, or shoot helpless innocents. Also, there is various facilities around the 240 square miles of L.A. that you can visit that offer training, new moves, new cars, new weapons, health, and more. The shooting, driving, and fighting engine really beat the hell out of GTA's. Especially the driving and fighting. The fighting engine is on par (and in some cases beats) with the best fighting games. This game is seriously fun, and if you like freedom, huge areas to explore, and a very good storyline, then True Crime is for you. As for the graphics-not the best seen, but also not the worst. The best things are the good car designs and the real-time reflections on the cars, also the extremely accurate city design. The music? Well, it mostly consists of aggressive rap music that matches well with alot of the gameplay. There's also a little rock found in the game. But if you don't like the music and you own the Xbox version of True Crime, you are in luck because this game supports custom soundtracks! All in all...this game is great.",0.0369889420836976

2598,4.0,"Let me start out by saying that I've played all the Jedi Knight games since back in the old Windows 95 days. I'm a fan of this series, but as good as Jedi Academy is I wasn't able to give it 5 stars because of one simple reason ... KOTOR.

KOTOR (or Knights of the Old Republic) is another Star Wars game in which you can assume the role of a Jedi ... and in my opinion, KOTOR (and KOTOR II) does a better job. Even though Jedi Academy gives you a lightsaber to start with and offers more Jedi powers to control, the problem is, well ... control.

Jedi Academy requires you to use a complex set of keyboard and mouse controls in order to control your character ... and considering how hard the enemies are (even in easy/Padawan mode) you need the controls to be as simple as possible for combat. In KOTOR, you can do almost everything with just the mouse.

I consider myself to be an experienced PC gamer, so keyboard and mouse controls are nothing new to me, but Jedi Academy requires me to jump all over the keyboard to control my character. Maybe KOTOR spoiled me, but seeing how simple the controls can be makes me angry when I have to play a similar game with MUCH more complex controls.

Anyway, graphics aren't bad and voice acting is pretty good. If you like being a Jedi I still recommend this game, but if your only experience with Star Wars games is KOTOR or KOTOR II then you probably won't like the controls in this game.

2599,4.0,"By combining impressive physics, slick controls, vast environments, and fantastic animations, developer Rainbow Studios (ATV Offroad Fury, Splashdown) has crafted a challenging and addictive motocross racer that successfully delivers a realistic riding experience without getting so caught up in many nuances that immediate fun is sacrificed.

Dabbled a bit b4 but last console I had was ps1 & I got it long after it's release & only played occasionally.  That being said, I have & also try a lot of games. I am no pro tho. I just play what I enjoy. This tomb raider game is fun. I like the collectables, hunting & the instinct option so I don't lose track of where to go to complete missions.

  Open world games r my fave, especially if it has a shooter quality to it & scavenger aspect is a huge plus for me. Altho I'm an animal lover, I do enjoy games that include hunting. Red dead redemption,  undead nightmare & far cry 3 r some of my faves. I can hunt via video game since no real animals get hurt. I hear the Uncharted comparison a lot & I wish I could say I'm a fan of the series but I am not. I know. Ev1 entitled to their own taste in games & I know ppl love it. I have tried but I find the lack of direction frustrating. I'd like it a lot more if it had tomb raider's instinct option. I enjoy it for a while & then get annoyed trying to figure out or get past getting to an area out of my reach. That prince of Persia sort of puzzle to get to a location thing just isn't for me. That's my least fave part of Assassins Creed too, that & tailing ppl,  but I love that series otherwise.

  I've only been playing Tomb Raider for a few days,  but it has kept my interest, which isn't always easy to do. If u r curious about this game, give it a try. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm glad I decided to give it a chance.

2601,4.0,"As a preliminary note, in this review, I describe the main gameplay modes of Brink, and then devote time to explaining my experience with the game. Ordinarily I try to remain more objective, to the extent that any review is objective, but Brink is unique in that it does not lend itself to that very well. Thus, a description of my experience is, I think, a more effective way to explain this game and aid consumers in making their decision about it.

I firmly believe that there are 3 basic types of game experiences. Type 1 is the single player experience, epitomized by RPGs and platformers. Type 2 is the deathmatch/team deathmatch, etc. type of multiplayer experience, encompassing everything from Call of Duty and Halo to Mario Kart. Then there's Type 3, the co-op experience, which you can see in (among other games) the Spec Ops missions of Call of Duty, the main campaign of Borderlands, and most of Brink.

Whether Brink is for you truly depends on your expectations. If you are looking for a good co-op experience, I would very much recommend Brink. If you're not, I'd strongly advise against it. My 4-star rating is based on the fact that my intent in purchasing Brink was to get a good, fun co-op experience, and that's what I got. It's by no means perfect, but taken for what it is, it's enjoyable. Before going on, I'll note that as of this review, one DLC pack was released for the game and it received several updates that improved its performance and overall quality. Since I never played it prior to those coming out for it (and the DLC pack happened to be free when I got it), my experience is based solely on that.

Brink has 3 modes. First is its story mode. This is an interesting experience. You play the same set of missions twice, once as the Rebellion and once as Security. The missions tend to be multi-part, meaning you move from objective to objective until you finish it. Each primary objective has a time limit. For the offense objectives, e.g. hacking a computer or placing a bomb, you must complete the objective before the time runs out, then move on to the next one. For defense objectives, like guarding a door or preventing someone from hacking the computer, you have to stand your ground for the time limit. If you fail to do so, the mission usually continues until you either completely fail to stop the other side from completing all of their objectives or you finally manage to do so. This means that some defense missions can be completed in 5-10 minutes, and offense missions on higher difficulties will often require much more time.

The second mode is Freeplay. This is largely a rehash of the story mode, but in this version, you can change the parameters. Among other things, you can completely eliminate the opposing team's forces, thereby allowing you to run through the missions unhindered and rack up experience points (and trophies). More on that below. Freeplay and story mode can both be completed co-op online, and on higher difficulty levels, co-op is practically required due to the AI, which I'll also discuss below.

The final mode is Challenge mode, where there are 4 challenges to complete. Each has 3 levels, and finishing them unlocks better weaponry and levels your character up. The challenges range from stupidly easy to insanely difficult with very little middle ground. Some of them are downright annoying. Further, while these can be completed in co-op, doing so does not yield any prizes, including trophies for PSN (or achievements if you're playing it on XBox 360).

Note that there is no direct deathmatch type of game in Brink, which is an odd choice on the developer's part. You can do online matches where multiple people are on one side and others are opposing them on the other trying to complete objectives, but there does not appear to be a way to completely remove objectives from the mix.

Finally, let me briefly discuss the overall gameplay systems and AI. In my playthrough of Brink, which was conducted almost exclusively online in co-op, my friend and I (life-long gamers in our twenties) used two words a lot: ""annoying"" and ""frustrating."" Story missions stick you with a team of guys. You can get bigger groups of human players together who would likely be more effective, but we did not have that luxury. To that end, it was us and 4-6 AI bots against 6-8 enemy AI characters. To get a particular trophy, we played through the entire game on the Hard difficulty setting. Enemy bots strategically placed turrets, guarded objectives, and picked us off with headshots from an almost impossible distance. Our team, on the other hand, decided to prioritize secondary objectives, run away from the battles, and generally make a mess out of things. In one mission in particular, we realized that we were the only members of our entire team actually actively working toward completing the mandatory primary objective. We had no way whatsoever to tell them, ""Hey stupid, come with us, we need you to guard us."" The only thing that seemed to work was for us to proactively complete those secondary objectives, thereby taking away from the list of things our team AI could do and forcing them to help. When our whole team was acting as a unit toward the completion of a particular objective, it was really effective. But that's ultimately Brink's problem.

As I see it, Brink has a few flaws. The team AI is uncontrollable, and it tends toward the unhelpful/stupid. Meanwhile, the enemy AI knows exactly what to do in every situation. Likewise, the teammate AI does not seem capable of the deadly accuracy and aggressiveness of their enemy counterparts on higher difficulty levels. Another flaw is that the challenges tend to become annoying, a problem directly connected to the one above because if the AI were better balanced, it wouldn't be as much of an issue. Additionally, the single-minded focus on co-op clearly comes at the cost of a solid single player experience or other multiplayer options. Finally, I have something of a gripe about Brink's story and general world. I know shooters aren't to be played for their stories usually, but to some extent, you can still get lost in the world of shooters. Say what you will about Halo, but it's tough to deny how cool it was the first time you looked around yourself and saw the world curve upward and loop around you. Brink has some story about two warring factions on the Ark, but I just never found it compelling in the least. I didn't care. The levels all look decent enough, but there's no life to them in the way that other games accomplish. I'm not unrealistically looking for a well-developed, deep RPG-style world here, but even with reduced expectations, Brink fails to deliver.

I want to end this review on a positive note because I honestly feel Brink is a good game, if perhaps somewhat flawed. I liked the level designs, and while there is not much variety, I felt that the game's core concept was really neat. I can't think of too many games where you get to see missions from both sides' perspectives, and it really adds a level of depth to the game that most lack. The guns are fun to use, as are *some* of the items. The parkour stuff in the game works about as well as can be expected from that type of system. Finally, the graphics are decent, though certainly not up to other games' standards (and it doesn't help that Brink released a week or two before L.A. Noire).

In the end of the day, whether Brink is for you depends solely and exclusively on what you're looking for. Do you want a good single-player shooter? Then get something else. Do you want a solid multiplayer deathmatch and team deathmatch type of game? Then get something else. Do you want an enjoyable co-op experience you plan on playing the whole way through with a friend online? Then you should seriously consider picking this game up. As a shooter, it's a mediocre outing; as a co-op experience, it's surprisingly a lot of fun, and it seems to me that fun is the most important part of games. Get it for co-op; skip it otherwise.",0.002007715734789842
2602,4.0,"Fred's Review: 9/10 stars

The fourth in the Satrfox series. In StarFox 64, you battled the armies of Andross and Andross himself. But in this game, you battle the Aparoids to their very own home planet and face the aparoid queen. 10 missions will only last you about 2+ hours and you can't choose multiple paths like you could in the 64 version. The graphics have been upgraded and I didn't find anything wrong with that part. The gameplay is very simple and easy to pickup but parts can become frustrating at times because you have to go all the way back to the checkpoint when you die. Most bosses are quite simple and easy but the Aparoid queen packs quite a punch. I'd give this game's replay value an ok but not great. I wish there were more single player levels. Multi-player is where the real fun comes in. Deathmatches, dog-fights, you name it.

Powerful weapons make it fair when it's Arwing(or Land-Master) versus regular players. Chaotic fun comes in when you or your enemies get powerups and blow you up.

Some characters are rigged like Wolf, he completely beats Fox's stats. Must buy game.",0.024891309407438444

Story

The story begins with the main character, Sean, a champion race car driver, in Paris recounting a series of events that has lead him to this little pub, being hunted by one of the countries most powerful Nazi commanders. While having a drink, a mysterious man approaches Sean, offering his help to rid Paris of the Nazis once and for all, but the dangers involved could risk the lives of everyone Sean holds dear.

Graphics

The games graphics are grainy, on purpose, to give the feeling of dread and doom (which is understandable, it IS Nazi infested Paris). While in Nazi territory, the environment loses all color, becoming black and white, the citizens are downtrodden and fearful.

As Sean takes down key points held by the Nazis, color slowly returns to the area, allowing him more freedom to explore and climb various buildings without being attacked by Nazis.

Controls

Controls are easy and simple to learn. Driving, which is notorious in games for being poorly made, is also simplified so that anyone can master it in a few minutes. Certain areas of buildings (rails, doors, windows, alcoves, etc) are highlighted by a small shimmer that allows the player to climb them to access the rooftops of buildings (ala Assassins Creed), however if caught by Nazis, they will open fire, knocking Sean down.

Sean can equip a numerous number of guns, ranging from pistols, shotguns and even rocket/grenade launchers (these will give your position away faster, but are a lot of fun). Gunplay uses a more over the shoulder style (similar to The Mercenaries), but you can also stealth kill if you wish to be more elusive.

Voice/Music/Sound

Voice work is done well, Sean (who again, is Irish sounds like an Irishman), citizens have a French accent and the Nazis sound German. What stands out is the music, which changes depending on the situation (in dangerous territory, it's somewhat depressing), when in friendly territory, is more friendly. If Sean does something suspicious/illegal, Nazis soldiers will come after him and the music takes a more dangerous turn.

Other

There are many, many, MANY objects to destroy (in fact, if you're an achievement whore, this may be a painful grind, as there are easily 600 things to destroy), luckily, the map shows the location of where these things are (although not always ground level).

There is a plethora of hidden areas for Sean to discover, and more vehicles then one can count (which, if you bring them to one of the many garages you eventually unlock, you'll be able to drive them at any point in the game, and this is also an achievement).

Overall

This is a fun game if you like open-ended games and/or collectibles, and blowing s*** up. However is can get very tedious for achievement hunters.

8.5/10.0 (4.5 STARS)

- Destructible environments

2626,4.0,"Long time fans of Grand Theft Auto know that each of the games in the post-PS1 era is thematically linked to a particular genre of movie. GTA III is heavily indebted to Mafia movies such as Goodfellas and The Godfather, as well as to the cable television series The Sopranos. Vice City is clearly influenced by Miami Vice and Scarface, while San Andreas draws a great deal of inspiration from Colors and Boyz N the Hood.

GTA IV-The Complete Edition carries on this tradition by transforming Grand Theft Auto IV into an homage to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. As in Kurosawa's film, a set of events is seen from multiple points of view, leaving the player to decide which perspective he or she believes is the most credible. Niko Bellic, Johnny Klebitz, and Luis Lopez, the main characters, each bring a different experience and interpretation to GTA IV's story line. Niko is an immigrant, forced to assimilate and adapt rapidly to a world completely new to him. Johnny is caught in a classic master versus apprentice situation. Luis, who is the only character with any kind of insider status, must choose between building his future and honoring his past.

These are all familiar character situations in videogames, of course, but Rockstar creates deeper and richer stories and characters than most other game developers. The majority of games stick to the bare rudiments of character motivation and development. Rockstar has given us THREE strong stories in the GTA IV series, each with a complex and compelling main character. It was ambitious of Rockstar to release Niko's view of the story first, in isolation, without any indication of what was to come later. Many of the events in the Niko version of the story, in fact, aren't fully explained until the Luis and Johnny episodes. Compare that to the usual rote or clichd story arcs found in too many games, even multi-episode games. There are a few studios that consistently produce well-written games in addition to Rockstar--Bungie, Valve, and Kojima Productions are three standouts--but the vast majority treat story and plot as afterthoughts.

Story and influences aside, the bigger question is whether or not GTA IV and the two Episodes are fun to play. The answer is YES, even though it is clear that Rockstar devoted a lot more development time to Luis' episode than it did to Johnny's episode. TLAD feels somewhat stripped down and is similar to GTA III in many ways. You'll spend most of your time following the main story, driving or riding to combat missions. If you fully explored Liberty City in Niko's episode, there isn't a whole lot to discover or do that you haven't already experienced. On the other hand, TBOGT contains a much broader variety of missions, side activities, and minigames. Most players will spend more time with TBOGT than with TLAD--but now that they're both part of this value priced set, it's no big deal. The important thing is to play the series in the order in which it was released (GTA IV then TLAD then TBOGT). If you don't, you'll miss out on properly experiencing how the full story unfolds.

Well worth picking up.",0.06014675946019672

2628,4.0,"Story:
It's Star Wars, what else can I say?  Either you've seen the movies, played the games or seen one of the umpteen million clones.  The one thing the game does do (with its tradmark humor) is it does explore some of the battles that are hinted at in the movie but never explored. Speaking of the humor in the game, the story is moved forward in silent (no talking) cut scenes that act out what happened in the story, usually with the characters doing something silly (where in the movie it was of course done seriously, proably with a annoying cg character and a lot of explosions)in a mini scene that summarizes what happened before and after the level. This paticular version combines the two previous seperate releases so you get the original movies and the prequel thingies, which means there is plenty material to explore and plenty of secrets to find. So take a look at this not just for kids take on the Star Wars universe and you may find yourself pleasantly suprised and maybe a little addicted.
-------
Game Play: Basic on the surface, run through the level bash anything that moves, but deep when the player starts trying to collect studs to fill the power meter, the power blocks and various other secrets that require the player to go back to the level and play through again with characters unlocked in later chapters. This game is also one of the rare one's that allow 2 player same xbox / same screen co-op so one can double the fun if they have someone else who wants to play.

Graphics: I'm not big on this so to me they are great, the levels are colorful and bright, stuff blows up real good and there is not much slow down. It may just be my TV but when there is a lot of action on the screen I can see the refresh line as the game / xbox tries to keep up.

Controls / Camera: The controls for this game are simple. One button attacks, one button jumps, one button uses whatever special ability a character uses. For the most part the characters do what the player tells them and rarely decides to jump into that pit of lava in front of him. I only had a problem with this in the level (return of the sith, pt 6) based around lava and you have to run and jump with the camera facing toward the characters so it's hard to see what is coming up. Speaking of the camera it's the usual fixed, occasionaly wonky deal but it is mostly servicable in this game.

2641,4.0,"I could make this review be an in-depth observation from one video gamer tall-telling the stupendous release from Irrational Games, known as Bioshock Infinite. But ultimately, I just want to elaborate that this is a game that one simply cannot explain in detail unless you play it. Adam Sessler's review from his youtube page spoke the utter truth. [...]
Pick this title up, because I strongly beleive once you have played it, you will never forget it.

Shot positive review: What the player will expect for another AAA title from Irrational games is more Bioshock gameplay that does set it apart from the previous installments. At some points it's better, then some points it feels like something was missing. There was one strong detail has not come up in most reviews though! Bioshock Infinite is like playing Halo. not that it made it good because of this, but more like comical when I realized this. You have a shield, that you can actually upgrade, but it does recharge. Once again, you can only carry two weapons (so far anyway) at a time. And last but not least, Elizabeth is like Cortana, but more she and Alyx Vance from Half Life 2 had a 1900s baby. She's VERY useful, interesting and NEVER GETS IN THE WAY. I'm pretty sure that I have not seen anything this flawless for buddy AI since Half Life 2. See, DICE, this is how you $%&#ing script AI for first person Shooters. Like Elizabeth, the protagonist you play as is also interesting with the meets more than what you are told kind of way. And let's not forget the main actor in this theater of American Zealotry: The floating city of Columbia. It...is...beautiful. Almost too bloomish with the lighting, but never a dull moment within her. Yadda Yadda Yadda, you know what, just play the game right now then come back to finish reading this review.

*Now, this next section I must implore the reader to divert your eyes away if you do not want anything slightly spoiled, because the following pertains to why I only gave this game a 4 out of 5. Why are you even reading this? PLAY IT, DARN YOU! Anwway...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
The previous installment to the ""Shock"" franchise did have a couple of gameplay features that I actually enjoyed. The first departed element are the big bad monster fights or encounters. In Bioshock 1 and 2, there were wandering monsters or something that you had to fight to either gain passageway or to become more powerful. This mechanic added to its difficulty curve and I loved it. There really is nothing of that here. Bioshock Infinite on normal difficulty was the easiest out of the three. 14 hours I played total of this game and it was 9 hours in when I died for stupidity. I was actually upset for the final confrontation to be just a slaughter the minions against time scenario or ""horde mode."" It had a wince of challenge, but nothing as memorable as throwing my controller up in triumph as I defeated Fontaine in Bioshock 1. Also, I missed the idea of fighting big baddies that had different variants. When playing you think the dreaded Songbird is going to be it....it doesn't. It's still a surprised, but I was let down because I wanted to fight something bossish in the damn game! If the Handymen were it, they were more annoying than epic and memorable as a Big Daddy.

The second departure is a notion of choice for the game's long conclusion. In Bioshock 1 and 2, depending on what you did or how much you did on a certain subject resulted with one of two possibilities. The player was rewarded with either the tear jerking happy result, or the awful bad ending. Well, from what I read on Wikipedia and what I received from playing, it seems that there is only one ending or outcome to Bioshock Infinite's  story. During my play through I wasn't even sure if there were anything within that was labeled a ""choice that matters"" situation. The ending  is of course hard to explain unless you play it yourself. After the two more positive emotional parts it then becomes, not exactly like, but reminiscent of Inception's  ending. Was this intentional from Irrational? Probably so because it was very unforgettable. I just wished there could have been something more.*

But in all, is it worth paying to experience Bioshock Infinite? (insert DUH! noise) What this game does seem to lack of what I loved in Bioshock 1, it completely makes up for it with the  engrossing atmosphere, spectacular AI interactions, political and religious themes, hectic enemy encounters, erratic and awesome sounds, and an unforgettable story. I think the only people that might have issues with this are the pro gamer First Person shooter fanatics. This game is meant to pull you in for the ride and not rushed for just achievements. Bioshock Infinite is another example of how a good example player first person shooter can be without an unneeded tacked on multiplayer. After this, I look forward to whatever Irrational Games can come up with.",0.008592521974868686
2642,4.0,Really good game it was one of the first games for the xbox 360. The graphics are ok in general but some parts it looks amazing. Controls are ok the camera can be a bit tricky since its 3rd person haven't played much single so I can't comment on the story but the action is good. The online is barely there I could never find anyone on ranked only on player matches if your lucky at least. I was able to find matches but if you see there is none its probably because they are already playing so if you really want to play the online just keep trying you'll eventually find the 1 match that is there to play frequently. To be honest I played Lost planet when the online demo was out and it was fun but the matches I played online when I bought it recently are rockets which are fun but can get boring after too much.

2644,4.0,"I bought BC2 in hopes of reliving my BF2 experiences from 2006. Overall, I'd say that DICE got more things right with this game than they got wrong. I consider myself an avid PC gamer and had been looking forward to this release after passing on MW2 (for a variety of reasons... no dedicated server & pricing reasons) I bought my copy of BC2 on Steam although I see that today it's actually cheaper here at Amazon. The installation went through without a hitch and I was able to immediately jump into the single player campaign. Getting into the multiplayer side of things was made easy by the fact I'd already registered a previous game with EA (Dragon Age: Origins) and was quickly joining a multiplayer game. Day 1 saw some severe stability problems with online play, but that seems to have cleared up now. My immediate impression was ""Holy crap! It takes 20 bullets to kill someone!"" Maybe twenty is an exaggeration, but it's not too far from it. If that's not your cup of tea, just bring up the ""hard core"" servers in the server list and play one of those. A friend introduced me to hard core mode and I don't think I'll ever go back. It is SO INTENSE. In my week with the game, the actual game has crashed to desktop once... no error or warning... just returned me to to my desktop. Since it's only happened once I'm not too worried. Overall the game loads quick, runs great (on a high-end PC) and though not quite as intuitive as some of Valve's games... the multiplayer is easy enough to get into. I'm not really sure how or why this game is currently rated 3 stars.

Pros:

* Destructible environments
* Tons of weapons / gadgets to unlock
* Intense game play (multiplayer mainly)
* Vehicles, vehicles, vehicles!
* Fast load time (and no, I don't have an SSD)
* Dedicated servers
* Different modes to cater to different types of players (hint: go hard core!)
* The game seems balanced... this is an accomplishment considering the variety of vehicles and weapons.

Cons:

* It did crash to desktop once
* It takes a long time to refresh the server list
* Registering with EA for the first time can be a pain",-0.019559299363375148
2645,4.0,"I read a number of reviews and hesitated at first. But when it hit discount I figured I had nothing to lose.

As the other reviewers noted, this is not the classic R-Type game. It is a strategy game along the lines of the traditional hex-based wargames. I have never really played those original R-Type games anyway so I get to treat this game with a clean slate.

Pros:
- It is very addictive

- Even if you lose a battle you don't lose all your ships. So you at least reap some rewards so that you can build a stronger fleet, learn from your mistakes, and try again.

- Surprisingly when you are close to obtaining victory (while potentially losing it all) this game really does put you on the edge of your seat.

- Missions are long and bountiful (57 missions total). A mission can take at least 20 to 30 minutes to complete. By making the missions long your level of commitment and excitement grows. Even though you seem to be able to plough through your enemies you are always wondering whether the tables could be turned at any moment because the enemy may have additional fighters hiding somewhere.

- Good story that makes you feel like you are in charge of the fleet.

- Supports adhoc mode play though I haven't tried it.

Cons:

- The in-game movies are too slow to load so usually you turn them off. This is a real pity because they could have easily used the geometric representations in the main strategy screen and given this game some kind of 3-dimensional feel.

- There is no way to undo an accidental move.

- Movement of large fleets can be labor intensive since there is no way to group ships into squadrons.

2646,4.0,"So for the first week I had this, it didn't work at all.  It wouldn't charge either of my controllers.  Out of frustration I just used it as a controller holder and had to keep using the cable to charge.

Then about a week in, for some strange reason it started charging them.  No idea why - nothing changed, it wasn't moved but it suddenly realized it's purpose in life and decided to embrace it.  Since then I couldn't be happier with this.  It is awkwardly built and you can't set it on carpeting because it will fall over - but it does charge the controllers now, which is really all I wanted it for.  It does light up when they are charging, which can be annoying if you have it set up in your bedroom.  I'm sure some people think that's pretty neat, I just find it a waste but that's me.

The problem with this game is that the monster battles are too frustratingly difficult. I did not enjoy this aspect of the game, and it will be the only big negative in what I remember about this game. Some of us aren't that good at the controls. My son is excellent and even he's having a hard time. I can see me not being able to finish the game and that makes it quite frustrating for me. Challenging? Great. Near impossible to where you're throwing down the controller and leaving the game? Not fun.

This remaster brings this already beautiful classic up to date with full hd resolution and 60fps performance on the PS4. If you're playing this for the first time today you might be turned offed initially since doesn't look as good as games designed and released specifically for this gen but like I said no other game before or after has captured the scale and ""epicness"" of this game.

If you already own this on PS3 I think a full price tag might be a bit too much for something that is not a full overhaul (textures still seem to be at the same resolution as the PS3 version) but at 30 or less this is definitely a must have title.

2656,4.0,"Amazing MMO mouse. It is the first one I bought, and I got it for half its base price. It just works when you plug it in, you only need a Razor account to start macroing buttons to do what you want if it isn't already listed in their default hotkeys setups.

Only two issues with this mouse, but they are small.
- I don't know what happened between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, but people from a few years ago are saying the software came with a back button. It does not. You have to macro it in yourself. Remember the Windows shortcut for Back is ALT + Left arrow key. Forward is ALT + Right arrow key. I toggled them onto the mouse wheel tilt left and right; since I've never had a mouse that can do that, I'm not used to using them in game.

- The mouse can be a bit unruly on a smooth mouse pad. My HyperX one needed to be replaced, so I did so with a Corsair hard surface pad. It was ultimately smoother since it was fresh, and the Naga was able to slide all the way across the mouse pad when held at just a 10* angle. It did not take me long to get used to, but it was unruly for a while when playing action MMOs like TERA or Elder Scrolls Online. The mouse was clearly made to be on rougher, cloth mouse pads. Turning down the sensitivity did it for me.

Other than those two minor things, this is an all a round upgrade to any mouse I have never owned. Granted, I've only owned cheap mice. Hopefully it lasts me a while. 2-3 years on $40 dollars is well worth it.",0.032079722171000066

2660,4.0,"First off rent or buy this for its many merits and your feelings towards a third person dragon flight sim personally. The hype machine took its toll on this title but I think it will stand on its own over time considering that LAIR delivers on many levels the production values as is standard on PS3 from my experience are top notch. Voice acting,cinematics,storyline,ambiance all rate above average.
There is a nice set of 12 tutorials that allows everyone to get a feel for the mildly complex controls.  The game is set up like and plays somewhat like ROGUE SQUADRON different level medals for each mission etc,unlockable dragons etc. With God of War style button matching combat and other varied moves such as TAKEDOWN,  The controls are smooth and responsive, firmware 1.93 is recommended for best results.(THIS IS POSSIBLY WHY SO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS) however in the heat of action the 180 degree turn just doesn't want to work for me and usually sends me dashing instead arrggh!  If you can embrace the somewhat shallow arcade like feel of the game overall and not long for the RPG like qualites of say a DRAGONRIDERS OF PERN  then you will find a satisfying meal of mead and meat at this gaming table. My biggest compaint is that rider and dragon appear small and I wanted more of feeling of being on the dragon. Other than that though a great fantasy setting and flight controls with a nice variety of missions will hold your attention rapt. The single person campaign could have been longer as the game seems to end just as it is getting good, however the motion control and fireball blasting make this a great ride while it lasts.

2661,4.0,"My brother and I rented this game numerous times and in the end finally decided to buy it. It is actually quite fun to play, with many arenas and many of the famous characters from Nintendo. Each character basically has their own arena, and all of the arenas have their advantages and disadvantages. This game is especially recommended as a gift for a child.
What I love about this game is that you can play with as many computers as you want, and they can be against you, or if you want to have fun they can be on your team. You can have timed battles or die from losing lives.
Pros:
1) Fun multiplayer action
2) Computer feature is great---you can set computers skill level
3) Good training level, where you can control many things, and add items and make the computer do things to help you train
4) Just Great!!
Cons:
1) Certain characters are hard to get (like Ness)
2) Less advanced than Super Smash Bros Melee
3) Controls are sometimes difficult

Yeah. They're definitely there. But if you're like me (semi-hardcore player) and you're not constantly playing shooters, this works just fine. There is no better feeling than playing Arkham City with a Batarang controller. The lights...are cool, I guess. The colors are nice, but I wouldn't say it has anything to do with why I bought it. I bought it because I love Batman. Other than that, the weight is nice, the triggers are a huge step up from first-party controllers, and the grip is solid. Turning it on and off is a small pain.

2666,4.0,"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2010 is the latest in the series to appear on Wii, and for an extra fee, you get Nintendo's latest Wii Motion Plus. The add-on to the Wii remote is not necessary to enjoy the game or even play it in its entirety, but if you're a hardcore golf fan who wants a more realistic experience where your swing affects your lobs, cuts and slices, then by all means spend away.

Its hard to find a flaw in Tiger Woods 10 because I've had so much fun. I mainly bought the game for the Wii-exclusive disc golf mode (which is awesome and a nice break from the normal game) and soon discovered that I would have to complete a character-driven career mode in order to unlock the more advanced, complex courses. I don't find this a problem because Tiger Woods 10 is fundamentally strong and offers a lot of customization in your career-based character.

When creating a character, you're given a basic set of points that can be used to alter your overall strength, driving/chipping/putting techniques, green approach and more. If you finish a course where you've nailed a few odd putts, you're given more points to alocate to that particular skill. This skilled system really makes you think about every shot and every course differently and really draws you into the game. If you're not into building up a character, the All-Play mode allows you pick a spot on the course, swing and ultimately play like a pro. This is a great addition for younger children who want to play with their parents or older siblings as it truly levels the playing field between amateur and pro.

Besides a career mode, Tiger Woods 10 also features the aforementioned disc golf mode, quick play mode which lets you jump in to a particular course of your choosing and a party mode. The party mode is the only mode that needs some refinement. The games aren't truly that fun (the golf cart driving one in particular) because you never really feel in control of what's on screen. If you're using your career character, these games can be fun because it really shows how far your character has progressed. If you're playing with the All-Play mode, you can easily tinker with your shot, find the hole and get a hole-in-one almost every time, thus rendering the competition with your friends or family pointless. I understand that most people are only going to pick this game up for the career mode, but it would have been nice to see EA try a bit harder with some of the mini-games because you're mostly doing the same motion over and over again.

The disc golf mode was my main reason for buying this game and is really a lot of fun. Instead of using a ball and a myriad of clubs, you're given a disc (Frisbee) and let loose onto some of the most prestigious golf courses. Much like Wii Sports Bowling, just grab and hold the B button, swing your arm like you would throw a disc and release. The game is so simplistic but a lot of fun and easy to get other people involved in.

If you haven't played a Tiger Woods game or are looking for a better golf experience than what's included on Wii Sports, Tiger Woods 10 is a great place to start.",0.02651387305856965
2667,4.0,"Don't get me wrong, this is a very great, solid game. The gameplay and controls match that of COD 4. The thing is that they went back to WWII. Alot of people are simply getting tired of WWII. So for about the first 3 or 4 months that the game was out, I didn't attempt to buy or even play the game. One day I just happened to have some store credit at Game Stop and got the game relitively cheap. I started with the mulitplayer which is always fun for the Call of Duty franchise. So not many complaints there. The story mode is fun but COD 4 just put it to shame. As well as they put this games multiplayer to shame. The only mode better for this game is Nazi Zombies. This is a great game within a game. It is very entertaining yet difficult at the same time. You have horde after horde of Zombies trying to break into your building while you kill them and attempt to board the windows back up as they come in. It is very fun when you have 4 of your friends along for the ride. Its just great fun especially with the improvements with the map pack add-on(with extra achievments!).

2670,4.0,"Borderlands is a synthesis of first-person shooter (FPS) and the popular massively multi-player online RPGs (MMORPG) games such as World of Warcraft or more aptly non-massively multi-player games such as Phantasy Star Online.  The game is overly ambitious and makes a lot of boasts, such as a claim that there are hundreds of thousands of weapons.  For the most part, the game succeeds and creates a satisfying and addictive experience best shared with friends.

PROS:
+++ Emphasis on co-op play
+++ Gorgeous cell-shaded graphics
+++ Tons of different weapons
+++ Missions and quests look to be modeled after World of Warcraft.  It is easy to tell what missions you have and what you have to do.
+++ Character customization options are abundant

CONS:
--- A lot of the weapons, about 95%, are generic forgettable junk.
--- Vehicle controls are hypersensitive at best or a sloppy mess at worse.
--- The story line is fairly weak
--- The enemy designs get really repetitive after a while

GAMEPLAY: At its core Borderlands is a standard FPS with lots of guns.  The emphasis on multi-player encourages up to 4 players to join forces and basically loot the place much in the way that Phantasy Star Online worked.  You can choose a brute, a hunter/sniper, siren/assassin, or soldier.  Each class has a specialty, but anyone can use any weapon.  Characters gain ability points as they pass levels and also improve their skill with individual weapon types by using that type of weapon.  Missions are nicely handled in a very World of Warcrafty sort of way.  While I'm not a fan of WoW personally, the system works.  Enemies in the game are randomly generated and sprouted from set spawn points.  After you have played the game for a while, you'll know WHERE you'll find enemies, but you may not know exactly what variation of enemy you'll find.  Ultimately, what drives the gameplay is the urge to build your character up and their quest for bigger and better loot.  Yes, it is level grinding, but the level of action.

PRESENTATION: Amazing, but it could use a few improvements.  On the good side, the game is stylish and slick with a Fallout/Mad Max feel neatly put together with some of the nicest cell-shaded graphics I've seen in a long time.  Menus work nicely and setting up a multi-player match with friends is a snap.  The game's HUD works nicely and gives you almost all of the information you need, but an onscreen mini-map feature is noticeably missing.  Instead you must open a menu system to access a map.  The other issue is the lack of variety of enemies, which fall into a few small groups.  There is fair amount of variation in the strength and abilities of individual enemies within those groups, but you'll mostly find yourself battling Skaggs (dog-like critters) and bandits.

GRAPHICS: Gorgeous.  The cell-shaded graphical design works nicely and the representation of the blasted wasteland is almost as good as Fallout 3.

CONTROLS: The controls are tight and responsive.  The auto-assist feature that helps keep enemies in your sights is subtle and doesn't hold your hand too much.  My only complaint about the game controls is focused on the vehicle controls, which are acceptable when you're in open spaces, but navigating any tight environment with obstacles is a profanity inducing chore.  My friends and I have accidentally Austin-Powered so many vehicles it stopped being funny and just angers us now.  The problem is that the camera position determines your driving direction and the left stick only handles your acceleration.  At higher speeds the controls work better and the vehicle responds more predictably, but navigating slowly and carefully degrades into an awkward experience at best.  Luckily, vehicular combat is only a small portion of the game.

AUDIO: The music in the game is good, although not particularly noteworthy.  The gun sounds are standard fair and the voice acting isn't bad.  The little quips and insults tossed out by the enemies get old after a while, but this is the case with most games where common enemies are allowed to speak.

VALUE: This game is big with tons of missions.  Many players will probably feel compelled to max out at least one character of each of the four classes.  I understand the level cap is 50, and I wouldn't be surprised if future downloadable packages raise that level cap by another 10 or 20 levels along with new zones, levels and missions.  I fully expect to get at least 30-50 hours of gameplay out of this title, quite possibly more.

Overall, this is a very strong game with only a few flaws.  I recommend Borderlands on any platform, but especially to any FPS fan that wants something slightly different from the standard Halo and Call of Duty fare that is so popular.  Fans of online RPG titles such as WoW and Phantasy Star Online may also enjoy this game.  The emphasis on multi-player co-op puts this game in good company with Halo: ODST and Left 4 Dead, so fans of those games should definitely consider this title.",0.03195316814882523

The graphics and not that great but I am used to gamecube graphics so it is hard to compare the two. This game has lots of aerial ground and jumping combos with the beam sword (which is the most fun if you have time to get good with it.) There are several disadvantages to this game that i would like to point out. First is that the gundams take far to long to die which is not real compared to the show. Second is the fact that they start you out way to quick, the game gets hard to quick. Also once you do get good the game is to easy so then it goes very quick, particularly because it only has 12 levels. The good things are the exhalent game play, which lets for good Sword fighting!

You play the main character (on the box), the Witcher ,and that's it.  Like most RPG's of today, there is the main story and many side missions.  You can explore around on your own and earn some money/experience, then get back to the main mission as you please.  One thing I need to bring up though, it's hard.  This game can be punishing at times.  Death is frequent in the early stages.  I've had to start over from scratch a few times already.  Many of the encounters you will face in the wild will be a lot more than you can handle.  They also threw in the dreaded equipment maintenance nonsense.  Your armor/weapons will degrade with use and will need repair.  That costs money.  Yup, you guessed it, money is scarce.  So, you really have to play carefully and not rush in to fights everywhere.  I found myself at times with no money and my hardware falling apart.  Not a good situation.  Strategy is very important.  Knowing the weaknesses of your enemy makes a huge difference between frustration and having fun.  Don't ignore the potions.  These are really a key element of the game.

2680,4.0,"We really love the Ratchet and Clank series of games, with the gameplay, humor and general mayhem. Deadlocked is NOT an adventure game like the others - it's a gladiator combat game. You don't even have Clank with you for most of the game.

It's not that this game is ""bad"" - but it's different. I really did like the whole exploring-worlds theme of the previous games. The gladiator matches in those were interesting diversions but I was always happy when they were over. In this game, that's all that you get. You go from arena to arena, mindlessly bashing away at enemies and trying to stay alive.

There are all sorts of mini-games that you unlock along the way - hoverbike races involving traditional follow-the-circles, shooting games, flying games, and much more. The humor is still quite fun, although it's now a very odd mix of very adult humor and very kiddy humor. The game is rated Teen so the adult humor is reasonably OK I suppose, depending on how protective you are of younger teens.

The weapons upgrades are as usual amazingly fun - and you get to have ""mods"" to your weapons like acid and napalm to customise them to your liking. You can do all sorts of mixes and matches to get just the feel that you want.

The graphics are of good quality - I've always enjoyed the graphic style of the Ratchet and Clank games so this provides more of the same. The sound is reasonably good, although we do find some really repetitive, annoying tracks in there. We also had the game completely freeze up on us a few times. Maybe it needed just a little more QA before it was released.

The multiplayer modes are a really nice extension of the game. I really enjoy playing a game with a friend, so anything with co-op in it is great.

I suppose on the up side that if this had not come out, we would have just been sitting here twiddling our thumbs until the next ""real"" release of Ratchet and Clank came out. So in that sense, I'm really happy to have this out as filler, to keep us busy until then. We definitely ran out to grab this as soon as it was released, even though it wasn't (as far as we were concerned) a fully fledged Ratchet and Clank game to plow through.

Well Recommended!

A fun, slightly inventive puzzle blast; Boom Blox finds you disassembling, destroying, or just playing around with a series of Jenga-esque blocks.  What really makes Boom Blox stand out from the pack though is that the game makes excellent use of the Wii-mote, and as a multiplayer party game, Boom Blox truly shines above all others.  If there are any downsides to Boom Blox, it's that the game's story (or lack there of) is more of a distraction than anything else.  Along with some moments of repetitiveness, the good outweighs the bad quite a bit: there are a heaping amount of inventive puzzles, and the game's level editor is simply spectacular.

2688,4.0,"I found a Jasper unit.  I bought it at Wal-mart.  It runs cool and it is fairly quiet, excluding the disc drive which is insanely loud (think tower PC rom-drive spinning at 48x).  I have already ordered the starter kit with a 60gb hdd so I can load the games I am playing currently.  The performance has been flawless so far.  No lag.  I actually liked the old xbox live layout better I think (it seemed easier to navigate), but the newer features are a must.

My only real complaint right now is that the bottom-right corner of the faceplate doesn't snap down all the way.  It is no biggie, but it just makes the console seem cheap, although I know the cpu and gpu are nothing to laugh at (even at 3 years old, although the nm have shrunk).  Speaking of hardware, I actually think MS went the better way with their machine than Sony.  At $200-300 for a console, I will be happy if it lasts 5 years (I spent a grand on my tower PC a year and a half ago and already it seems out of date with the i7 intels making the core 2 duo's look like a joke).  At the rate computers are advancing, it doesn't make sense to design a 10-year machine like the PS3 is suppossed to be.  MS will gain further market share if it brings out a new system by 2011 that will of course be superior to anything now, and blu-ray will be much cheaper then also.  I also hope they end the hard disk drive system for a bigger solid state internal memory (maybe 8 or 16 gigs), and they can sell an external 3.5"" HDD with a terabyte for the downloading types.  Oh, and it better have wi-fi built in, especially since they are pushing on-line play so hard.  That is a shameless ploy to sell those outrageously priced adapters.  The wi-fi adapter at retail costs HALF what the base console does?  Absolutely ridiculous.  In fact, MS would be wise to stop or at least lessen the 'nickel-and-dime' trend they have been on.  It generates cash revenue, but at a cost to consumer satisfaction.  The DVD adapter on the first Xbox was the worst of all time.  Sell the remote to people who want one, but do not block DVD playback to force buying the adapter.  I could not believe that one.  Sony would never stoop so low.  Show some class please, at least a little.  I know people love to rag on MS, and I too have issues, but sometimes it is just unwarranted.  If Apple had the courage to lower their computer costs (perhaps allow other vendors to build machines?), we might have some real competition.  But, as is, how can the world hate MS when they have encouraged competition in the pc sector and we now have laptops under $500 and towers for even less?  Anyway, got off track there.  Enough talky, time to play.",-0.018788872196530096

2690,4.0,"The cleaning cloth isn't exactly great nothing compared to the original cleaning cloth, sometimes the cloth leaves part of it on the screen but does take out fingerprints and smudges.

The screen protectors are good for the price , you have to center them for them to fill out the screen properly otherwise if you don't a little piece of screen will still be ''naked''. Its near impossible to not get bubbles, maybe its the screen protectors or maybe its just how most of these are.

I cut some of these ( screen protectors)  for smaller phones and mp3 players and i get 1 to no bubbles at all in them, i think it has something to do with less air being trapped. Fits nicely on all  psp models ( except psp go) : 1000-3000

It will take up quite a bit of space on your hard drive, roughly 3 gbs, luckly I have a 250gb hdd. First off I didn't notice any lag at all, and  I couldn't find any issues with this game at all. If you're a fan of great graphics, than this game is not for you, but the gameplay is superb. You do have to have some sort of strategy before you get the mission started. If you decide to run and gun you will probably get shot and killed, there is no respawning either, so you have to make sure you stay alive. Usually what my team does, we usually stick in packs of 2 or 3 just in case we need backup. Also I really like the fact that almost every socom player has a headset, and people actually do use it while playing socom. The headset comes in really handy especially if you decide to travel in packs. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys realistic shooters.

 Madden is very cool, I'm sure SSX is really cool too, and getting a second controller and a movie is pretty nice too. The problem is that NHL 2001 on the PS2 isn't all that good....the PS version of it is much better. And while Armageddon is an impressive looking and sounding movie, this set would be far better with a good movie like The Matrix or Braveheart.
 Also, I can't tell for sure, but the picture looks like it's not a Sony controller. If that's the case, that's another minus, because non-Sony accessories are notorious for being junk, although it's possible this one is an exception.

2697,4.0,"If you are going to buy this game you will need to go to Baldurdash's page and download some of the things on his site for it.  You can increase the difficulty of the battles (actually makes for a truely epic and HARD final boss) and also fixes some plot points that were removed (Imoen's bhall taint finally manifesting, Saravok dialogue options).

The quests in this game are definately a challenge, and for the most part very fun.  The biggest problem is that there really are not any side quests worth talking about.  The plot is very see through, I thought, and really you don't see many new things that will take your breath away.

With that said the game does have its merrits.  If you like BGII and don't mind a more liner plot then you will love this game.  The addition of feats allows everyone to continue getting stronger and helps remove the problems of a ceiling for fighter types (after all, once you get to a certain point you just always hit).

The ending battle, when not modified, is not too terribly difficult.  On the other hand, the modded end battle is definately not for those who are easily frustrated as you will most likely try and fail many MANY times.

If you want a definate ending to the game then you should give this game a try.  However, if you don't feel to strongly about it then consider avoiding it since it is pretty much just more of the same.  Don't expect a plot that will draw you into what is going on.",-0.025008330740673844
2698,4.0,"The Sonic Mega Collection features seven games from the blue hedgehog's glory days on the Sega Genesis.

The collection includes:
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic 2 (my personal favorite!)
Sonic 3
Sonic & Knuckles
Sonic Spinball
Sonic 3-D Blast
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine

Not to mention extra unlockable games, artwork, and videos.

Sonic 1, 2, 3, and Sonic & Knuckles feature the high-speed platforming gameplay many fans are familiar with. Sonic Spinball is basically a pinball game featuring Sonic and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is a puzzle game (in the style of Dr. Mario). I have to gripe about the collection is Sonic 3-D Blast, it lacks Sonic's signature speed and has  repetitive, boring gameplay.

My only other complaint is that although animated videos for Sonic CD are included in the bonus features, it is noticeably missing from the lineup of games and isn't even offered as an unlockable. Fans had to wait for the Sonic Gems Collection to play it. But still, there are several other excellent games on the Mega Collection that help make up for it.

2701,4.0,"The Power Stone series is best described as a hybrid of the fighting and platform genres. While still at it's heart a fighting game, Power Stone 2 introduces many other elements which deviate from your traditional fighter. The gameplay is completely 3-dimensional...you can jump up platforms, climb on walls, pick up a variety of different weapons, and even use vehicles such as tanks and gun turrets to dispose of opponents. Perhaps the best feature of all is the multi-player battles. Even though the action can get quite chaotic, it's still fun to blast each other around the incredibly colorful and detailed arenas. The Arcade mode should have been just a little longer, and unfortunately the simple controls don't allow for much strategy...but as a multi-player party game that anyone can jump into, Power Stone 2 is one of the best.

2705,4.0,"I am 16% into this game after hours and hours of play. San Francisco is big, beautiful, and feels very alive. I passed on the first Watchdogs, but after reading a few reviews I was really curious. The characters are likeable, I dig the Deadsec aesthetics, the story is good enough, and the tools & skills available create a myriad of options when it comes to tactics. I LOVE the RC and the drone - save up and buy the drone ASAP! Watchdogs 2 offers non lethal options for dispatching enemies which is refreshing after playing lots of GTA V. The game runs well enough on the PS4 but I've noticed some frame juttering and what looks like screen tearing on occasion when roaming around the huge populated environment. Watchdogs 2 is ""enhanced"" for the PS4 Pro and I'm guessing this might be the new normal - you'll need a PS4 Pro to get the best experience on massive open world games like this (or buy the PC version and have top tier hardware).

I do have some gripes/suggestions (if anyone from UBI happens to cruise amazon reviews):
- The driving in 3rd person feels a bit off. Not terrible, but not always good. Driving in the GTA series feels natural or just more real. Here it feels like an arcade game and the camera is to slow to adjust around sharp turns. I've found driving in 1st person is a much better experience.
- Enemy AI is aggressive and predictable. When you get discovered they swarm on Marcus immediately, but if you evade and hide they give up and go back to patrolling. I wish it was more in the middle - smarter enemies with less emphasis on the dog pile/swarm tactics.
- The tone of the main Deadsec crew and Marcus is pretty upbeat and even optimistic. That tone contrasts with the more violent options in the game. I enjoy tearing things up in GTA. That's due to GTA's characters being genuinely bad dudes and the world they inhabit being a cynical reflection of our reality. I'd love to have seen more consequence applied to the choices made in Watchdogs 2 - like in the Dishonored franchise. If you take a violent path the city reacts and becomes more chaotic with a darker conclusion. If you favor stealth and non lethal engagement the world is less violent and the  resolution is more hopeful. Guns in this game are acquired via 3D printing. Maybe give some choice here between lethal and non-lethal. Like a sniper rifle that shoots tranq darts, a shotgun that shoots bean bags, or even something wacky like a net or foam cannon. The characters are young hackers fighting for the people. Once you give them guns and they start killing people that makes them domestic terrorists waging an insurgency. I'm pretty sure that would affect Deadsec's follower numbers and public perception.
- The PS4 controller has a touchpad. I can't believe this wasn't put to better use. Every time I use Marcus's phone I think about how natural it would have been to use the touchpad to interact with his smartphone. Feels like a missed opportunity.

Anyways I'm really enjoying my time in Watchdogs 2's San Fran. Exploring, hacking, and playing with those wonderful toys!",0.017158795413180335

2708,4.0,"Just when you thought Rock Star couldn't surpass Grand Theft Auto, they slap everyone in the face with this beautiful masterpiece which they call, `Manhunt.' FULL of the blood and violence that I've come to love in video games today. They really decided to stretch the limits with this one. It's about time somebody grew some balls big enough to stand up to those censorships, and to the threat that some of the public holds against games of this genre.

You play as a convict who was sentenced to death for crimes unknown, but the only place you die is in the mind of the public. Your death was staged, so you could be used as a pawn in a corrupt, underground snuff organization, which is governed by a guy called Starkweathers. Despite his sick passion for filming the deaths of people, Stark is actually secretly contracted by the Police? FBI? to stage the deaths of criminals (like you) so they can be forced to engage in a ring of survival and mayhem. You are placed in deserted sections of Carcer City, weaponless, to kill gangs hired to kill you. This is some morbidly creative way Carcer City wants to dispose of it's criminals. The theory is that you will take out an X number of wanted criminals for as long as you can, before you yourself actually gets hacked. You are being filmed the entire time, as Starkweathers is monitoring you through cameras set-up everywhere and talks to you through a little ear-piece. Meanwhile, people are paying money to see these videos Starkweather is directing at your expense, which will not go to chairty.

Are you loving it yet? No? Okay...it may sound too frustratingly hard to take out so many bad guys like yourself without all the automatics and revolvers that most games will supply you with offhand, but it's not. You run through this game pretty smoothly, in fact. Thankfully, the 20 missions this game has are very long. None fail to entertain. All environments are large, heavily shadowed, and full of things to hide behind. Once hidden, you make noise to attract your prey. Once they walk by you, you walk after them, with whatever weapon you found in hand (a bat, an axe, a machete, a crowbar, a glass shard) and kill them unsuspectingly. Each weapon has 3 unique executions that you can perform on `the unsuspecting'. We're talking gutting, decapitating, castrating, stabbing, neck-breaking executions that just never get boring (Starkweather always appraising you through your little ear-piece as the bodies continue to mount). And if you're a lover of some nice shoot-out action, then this game has a little something for you too. About half way through, you go from Medieval sword fighting to your typical kill them all and let no one live shoot'em up game. Revolvers. Shotguns. Sniper Rifles. Uzis. Assault Rifles. This game's got all the goods. You can huddle behind anything during a shoot-out (garbage dumpsters, turned over cars in the middle of the street, mail-boxes). This system is set-up to where all you have to do is press the target button, and your character will pop his head out, gun pointing at someone's head, shoot, release, and back down he goes. This process is repeated until everyone's dead. Very intense when you have four or five guys hiding behind stuff and shooting back. It's all about timing and good judgment. If you shoot someone close enough, their head comes right off and pieces of brain splat on the wall behind them, stick there for a while, then slide down. It just don't get better than this people.

This game is not for everyone. It's plot is utterly pointless, it totally involves no thinking, and it's story is hardly worth following. For gore hounds only. This game here probably raised even the eyebrows of a few of those crazy Japanese people that are literally the KINGS of Snuff videos and violent entertainment. If only our culture would just loosen up a bit, we'd see a whole lot of what Rockstar is only showing us glimpses of. This has got to be the most violent and sick game for the American PS2 console, so get it now.",-0.01528558509199529

2710,4.0,"This game starts you off on a remote island where you are lost.  You have to eat, which is a puzzle in itself.  Then you explore the island, trying to find a way home.  Most of the puzzles in this game are logical, except 2 or 3 which involve you tinkering with it until you get it.  I had to look at a walkthrough for 1 such puzzle, because the clue they gave didn't make sense.

The graphics are beautiful - and they are not still shots like in many other adventure games.  Each shot has something moving in it -- anything from a butterfly to a monkey hurling rocks at you.

A couple of scenes involve your quick thinking.  Hang around too long and you're dead.  But rest assured, if you die, it resets to just before that scene (so no worries if you forgot to save).

Another great thing about this game is that there are multiple ways to do almost every puzzle.  You can assemble things and make different chemicals, weapons, foods, etc.  It's nice to have some flexibility in the game, especially if you didn't find an object that's needed to make something.

The ending is quick and sudden, but exactly what I expected.  The surprises came in the middle of the game.  The game is based on a Jules Verne novel -- but don't expect the same quality of story line.  It's good, but not a classic novel by any means.

The real downfall of this game is the length.  It is considerably shorter than many other adventure games - even shorter than Syberia.  Still, the price tag makes up for that fact.  The game's price debuted at a mere $20 list, whereas other games are $40+.

2713,4.0,"When I finally got my hands on this rare gem at a reasonable price, I thought that it would top all the other fight-themed GBA titles I've been buying for the last few months.  So far, it looks like I'm right.  The 2D graphics are fluid and never skip a frame.  The gameplay is fast-paced and challenging.  Special move lists for each character are included in the pause menu and I can execute most of them with no problems; you heard me!  That's because you can change the control scheme in the options menu.

So far my biggest concern with playing KOF EX2 is the fact that it has about as many gameplay options as ""King of Fighters XII.""  Another concern is that new modes and content is unlocked through the game's 'Orochi' ranking system.  When you beat the game without losing or you quit after losing, your fighters' progress is evaluated with stars that they earn by winning matches.  If one fighter gets 8 stars, he/she achieves Orochi (or Master) rank and can perform unlimited supers while in 'Master Mode' (Press the L & R button).  Still with me?  There's no way around this method, you can't rank up over time, and your have to do this with EVERY SINGLE FIGHTER in order to unlock everything.

After reading that last part, most of you would probably look into Versus Mode for replay value.  But don't fret it.  Just play the game on Easy and before you know it, you'll have a 'howling' good time with KOF EX2.

If its just you playing(which in this case it is only me playing because I only have 1 remote), you can play with computer players, or you can play by yourself.  Pat explains to you that when you play by yourself, you have 7 turns a round. If you guess a wrong letter, solve the puzzle wrong, or land on lose a turn or bankrupt, you lose a turn. Once you used all 7 of your turns, the round is over and you move onto the next round.  When you win the bonus round, you unlock different stage settings and new cloths and stuff.  I love how real it looks, and for once you actually have Pat in the game. I think every version always had just Vanna. Its pretty cool that you have Charlie too.  Vanna will explain everything to you from what the toss up is to when you land on a free play space. This game is addicting and I've been playing for over a week for at least an hour when I play and I haven't gotten a repeat puzzle yet.  I love how you can spin the wheel with the remote. I only have a few minor complaints hence the 4 stars:

Being that this is for the Wii.....I thought they would have branched out. I hate being referred to as player one.  With this kind of system, Pat should be referring to us by name.  I also think it would have been cool if you could put in where you are from, what you do etc etc and Pat introduces you just like on the show and there could be made up bios for the other players.

Its hard to chose a letter. More than once I clicked on the wrong letter because its hard getting the arrow on the letter that you want and its cost me.

When I flick the remote to the right and then to left, sometimes the wheel won't spin. I sometimes have to do it more than once.

I get bankrupt too much. I just played and I kid you not I got bankrupt 3 times in a row and 4 times in the same game.

2728,4.0,"I was very worried that this game wouldn't look beautiful on the PS4.  Rumors of extremely low framerate made me starting to question my digital (all sales final) purchase.  Fortunately, I was wrong.  The game does drop in framerate during some of the cutscenes (which is probably because of the rendering and loading of the open world you're about to play after the scene) and some of the graphics look very last gen.  It's a port, not a new game, so a lot of that can be forgiven.  However, once you're actually playing, it's a breath of fresh air.  The character animations are spot on and all the action runs super smooth.  Having played the game before will help you to know what to expect.

This was a great game on PS3/Xbox 360 and now, with this port, it's a smooth game next gen (I have only played it on PS4 so can't speak for Xbox One).

2730,4.0,"Ok, finally an RPG that is an RPG.

Built as a first/third person shooter, and based on the Half Life engine, this game delivers a great story in a non linear fashion.

At the beginning of the game you can choose between 7 classes of vampires. Each class has a distinct demeanor and different powers. For example, you can choose to be a noble and aristrocratic Ventrue and use mental power to dominate foes. Or you can choose to be a Gangrel, in communion with the animals and with the ability to transform into a beast and shred your enemies to pieces while moving 5 times faster than them.

Believe me, in Bloodlines (as in the original White Wolf RPG) there is a Vampire that will just fit your needs and desires.

All missions can be completed in various different ways and using different sets of vampiric powers.

Game Breakdown:

Graphics 8/10: Downtown LA is absolutely awesome and well done. People walk around the roads, talk on their cell phones, chat with each other while smoking a cigarette. Lighting is good, but not even close to Doom 3.

Sound 9/10: The soundtrack is awesome and you will find its CD in the game. Voiceovers are good, but not exceptional.

Story 9/10: well written and fun. You will be in for a few surprises. Moreover, it has a high degree of non linearity. It modifies based on your gender, your vampire clan and your decisions. This brings awesome replayability.

Gameplay 8/10: I think combat in this game is very good, however weapons need to be equilibrated (your plain fists seem to deal more damage than a knife). Spells work awesome, and if you choose certain clans (like the Tremere) you will be able to see how powers and spells are more effective than hand to hand combat.

Moreover, you have a good set of skills that enhances your interactions with non playing characters. You will be able to seduce, manipulate, convince, threaten... these options are many times better than just killing somebody to get what you want.

I take a star off of what would be a 5 star product for 1 reason:

THE GAME IS BUGGY!!!

1. Doors are messed up, they open and close really bad.

2. Movies and cinematics seem slapped together and the soundtrack doesn't work very well in them.

3. You will get stuck in wierd places sometimes and have to reload. Save often!

A patch will surely fix all this.

Bottom line:

I LOVE THIS GAME! And I suggest it as a must buy to any Vampire or White Wolf fan. For all the others, I suggest this game to:

1) RPGers who like FPS games.

2) People in search for a non linear RPG in a non fantasy setting.

3) For big time fans of RPG, this game is nice.",0.04576463590416044
2731,4.0,"It's a very fun and interesting game. Very different from other Kirby models because of the lack of powerups and the fact that food does not equal health. As always it is a very cute environment and Mass Attack brings a lot of new elements to the game because it is based solely on the use of the DS stylus system. My only complaint was the fact that certain levels require a certain amount of Kirbys and, this sometimes required you to go back to an older level to get the number that you needed. Also, so many Kirbys on the screen can sometimes be much too overwhelming, especially when you cannot get them all in one place.

2733,4.0,"Gameplay: 8.4

Every car handles differently, every course is linked together in one massive world, and the controls will take you back to the days of arcade racers like Daytona USA. (Actual arcade racers - the ones with $5,000 cabinets all arcade owners dreaded purchasing.) The customization features are a little shallow, and the game is a little easy. Okay, a lot easy. But you'll love the ride while it lasts, and you're going to want to play through this racer more than once.

Graphics: 8

The cars look amazing. Every part of them is packed with realistic detail. Even the interiors are noticeably accurate. The cars reflect the city lights quite beautifully, and will do so differently depending on the type of finish that's been applied (chrome, matte, etc.).

Carbon's environments aren't nearly as memorable. The backgrounds aren't that far beyond what was possible with the old Xbox. Also, the cars, as gorgeous as they are, cannot be damaged. They can crash repeatedly, and abolish generic police vehicles. But your vehicles - which are from licensed manufacturers - are as protected as those in Gran Turismo, save for a few scratches every now and then (that magically disappear after every race).

I know that this is what most, not all, automakers want. But if some manufacturers are on board and others are not, maybe it's the supportive companies you should be focusing on - to give the gamer the most intense experience possible.

Sound: 7.9

Hurray for the return of full-motion video! First you get to see the actors, who look toward the camera when talking to the player's character as if you were actually in the story. The actors also appear in polygon form, with extreme realism to boot. Their polygon expressions are a little better than their real expressions, mainly due to the real actors' lack of believability.

The voices - they're better than most, but have a hint of ""video game syndrome."" It looks like a bunch of actors were hired to be in a video game. It doesn't look or sound like they were hired to be in a professionally written story. Which isn't too surprising. Carbon's characters only have one theme: ""take my city and I'll hate you forever"" (an exaggerated but truthful interpretation).

Difficulty: Easy/Medium

Most Career mode races can be won on the first try. The external challenge mode provides additional races to conquer, but they're not enough to boost this game's difficulty.

Concept: 7.5

It's Need For Speed all over again. I'm not about to be one of those crazy people who say the series needs an overhaul to be great again. It doesn't. I love the direction the developers have taken. That said, it's not an original direction, just one of polish. But this series is meant to be a certain way. To make it original again would likely eliminate all the things we love.

Multiplayer: 8

Four for co-op; eight for multiplayer via Xbox Live. Some of the Career mode races are playable online as well for added challenges.

Overall: 8.2

A throwback to the good old, worry-free days of arcade racing. This is the kind of game you'll play after seeing The Fast and the Furious (or any other street racing flick). You might hate that series - you might think the third Furious is the worst movie ever made.

2735,4.0,"Ace Combat Zero is a prequel to the Ace Combat series, You get fully up to date graphics and gameplay, while finding out what happened to set up the wars in the Ace Combat series.

There are fewer yes-no types of questions than in previous games, and less character development, but the mission tree is much more nicely done - you often get to choose from ""land missions"" or ""air missions"" depending on your personal preferences. Also, your aircraft can now be configured to have the missile types that you enjoy using the most.

The cut-scenes have been improved with a more realistic look to them, but in game graphics are about the same as Ace Combat 5. That's not to say they are bad - you get high quality views of the planes you're in, the landscapes you fly over and detailed towns beneath you. It's really rather impressive how well they can render an entire ""world"" in 3D, in real time as you zoom over it.

The voice actors seem reasonably good, helping you feel involved in the air battles, and the soundtrack is epic in scope without overwhelming you or bombarding you with inappropriate modern music.

You only have one wingman at a time, compared to previous games where you could have multiple wingmen. Occasionally there are other flyers on your side in the sky - it's just that they are not under your direct control. You can specify what types of targets your wingman goes after.

If you're a two player fan, there's now a versus mode where you can fly head to head against a friend and test out your skills.  On the downside, the game is MUCH shorter than Ace Combat 5, so if you're a good flyer, you'll finish quickly. Still, you can go back and replay multiple times to get all the endings and to earn all the medals.

2736,4.0,"This is a fun revision of gen III. I say revision and not remake because a lot of things have changed that would keep me from seeing this as a true remake. The basics that you would expect are all still here. Pick between a boy or girl then get a starter to start battling gyms and evil teams. There are loads of new systems added from there along with some old systems from x and y like super training and pokemon amie. There is a new pokeradar system that lets you see what pokemon are in an area, and you can search for them after you have seen them at least once. From there you have to move slow and sneak up on the pokemon to battle it. These pokemon have a chance to have a random move that they normally wouldn't have at that level. However exploiting this and the EXP All feature can create some serious hand holding to make the game too easy.

Some people say that difficulty is in making a team for online battle, but I always enjoyed the challenge in past games which the 3DS games sorely lack.

Also while HM's aren't the problem that they used to be they are still a pain in this game. Most of the HM's you will need are water based, so you will either have to distribute HM moves across your team or have two hm slaves just for water hm's.",-0.011203332493155721

I'd really like it to be able to map out the buttons so I can use X for Gas and right trigger for boost. Reverse isn't much of an issue for me. My wife has a much harder time playing this, than she does Revenge.
The Burnout Pardise looks awesome but you can't smash other cars off the road anymore and no more Smash ups at Intersections. I also seem to crash a lot more in this than I do in Revenge, but, overall, I really like this game. Being able to power drift in Wriggly Field is pretty cool.

2740,4.0,"As a life-long Monopoly fan (to the point where I'm programming my own PC implementation [not for profit... for fun!]), I had to ask Santa for this game as soon as I saw an ad for it on Youtube.

My first instinct after playing it once was to give it one star for having a massively unintuitive interface.  But it turns out that reading the all-important warning at the beginning of the game is a good idea.  HOLD THE WIIMOTE HORIZONTALLY, NOT VERTICALLY, WITH THE ""1"" and ""2"" BUTTONS ON THE RIGHT AND THE POWER BUTTON ON THE LEFT.  After figuring this out the hard way like a moron, I boosted my rating to 3 stars immediately.  Derp.

There are a number of pluses about this game, but the negatives are fairly severe.  It'll be up to the user to decide to what extent said negatives impact their gaming experience.  Also keep in mind that someone coding her own implementation has thought more about interface design and game play for Monopoly than the average Jane, so it's possible I'm a little harsher than I might otherwise be.  Then again, the designers and coders at EA should be able to do a better job than an undergraduate computer science minor.

POSITIVES:

-The #1 benefit to this game is its creative visual twist on the classic board game.  I'd actually envisioned it as a set of literal properties in the past, so it's really cool to see the game come to life.  They did a good job with the animations, and it's fun to look at the game quite literally from a different angle.

-They included 6 or 7 different game scenarios.  The classic Monopoly is there, of course, but you can also play other twists, such as having the endgame condition be ""the first player to obtain two color groups wins"" (my least favorite), or the scenario ""all properties are improve-able and may be traded with houses/hotels on them... first player to double their worth wins.""  Some of them are pretty interesting.

-All of these game scenarios can be customized with several pages of menu options.  You can even save a set of customized rules for future games.  Worth a whole star in itself, in my opinion.  Awesome!

-The menu and interface to mortgage, buy, and sell houses is a vast improvement over the click-heavy old one (in the other Wii Monopoly game).  You can do it all with ease from one menu.  Mad props to the EA folks for this huge improvement.

-The music creates a mood without being obnoxious or particularly noticeable.

-I see my family members' Miis walking around the streets.  A very cute touch.

NEUTRAL:

-One of the other reviewers complained that you can't see the overall game board except after your turn.  That is not entirely true.  They don't mention it anywhere, but I serendipitously discovered that **if you hit the ""A"" button at the beginning of your turn, you can see the overall state of the board**.  Granted, I wish they would have a small ""overall state of the board"" picture at the bottom of the screen, but I do think that it would be distracting from their cool animations.  So I understand why they would make it something that you can only see every so often.  But it's still a shortcoming that there are only certain times when you can see the whole board.  It's hard to visualize and keep track of.

-Unlockable pieces, boards, and the ability to use Miis.  That last one, I feel should be an option from the beginning.  Fortunately I was able to unlock it after one game.  Also, most of the boards are just repeats from the other Wii Monopoly game.

-Keeps track of your overall stats (such as number of jail terms and other fun trivia).  Unfortunately, it makes no distinction from user to user.  So it combines stats from all members of my family.  Maybe my family is just competitive, but on games such as Wii Jeopardy and Wii Wheel of Fortune, we enjoy trying to outdo eachothers' stats!

NEGATIVES:

-The worst thing about this game, in my opinion, is the unbelievably annoying nature of the non-Mii playable characters, with whom you are stuck if you play by yourself.  What was EA thinking on this one?  Is there seriously anyone out there who finds this cute?  They all speak in gibberish utterances with maniacal laughs, grunts, or ""huh?""s.  About the only person who says comprehensible words is the wheelbarrow farmer girl who will randomly say ""Howdy howdy howdy"" or a barely understandable ""Eh, come on...""  I admit that I'm starting to get numb to it, but... seriously?  Whose bright idea was this?  I'd consider docking almost an entire star for this.  There's no way to turn just that off, either.  It's indescribably obnoxious.

-Mr. Monopoly's comments are slightly less annoying than in the other Wii Monopoly, but apparently they've decided to trade ""annoying"" for ""lame.""  Want some examples?  Sometimes landing on a Chance/Chest will elicit a ""Awwww, did someone send you a love note?  *exaggerated kissing noises*""  Or landing on a property will sometimes trigger the comment ""This is a lot of land!  Get it?  Lot?  Land?...""  I still find myself shaking my head and wondering what the writers were smoking when I hear some of these things.

-The animations take forever.  There is a ""fast forward"" button, but the constant need to use it sort of negates the primary ""positive"" about the game.  Why couldn't they just make the animations shorter?  I don't need to watch the woman playing the dog do a disco dance at the beginning of each turn.  (A very minor example, but the point still stands.)  It's unnecessary to stop at ""Go"" every time someone passes it, just so Mr. Monopoly can run over, say something stupid, hand over some money, leave, and then have the player do a little dance, and finally continue their move.  Seriously.

-Largely because of the last bulletpoint, one game takes forever.  You might want to have something handy to fill the times when you're not doing anything.  Like Christmas thank you notes.  Or margaritas.  Or writing this review.  All from experience...

The games have graphics like the PS2, and it has a control stick, which isn't seen often in handhelds.  It plays UMD's rather than cartridges, which are tiny discs that stay in a protective case, so you don't have to worry so much about your discs getting dirty or scratched, which is nice.  (Just remember to buy a memory stick duo for saving.)  The screen is also a decent size.
One problem is the rechargable battery doesn't last super long.  It gets to 1 bar of power left in about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  It can last at least 4 hours, but be careful not to play too long.  If the power indicator flashes, it means the charge is low, but it gives you very little warning.  You barely have enough time to reach a save point, so I always charge it before it ever gets that low.  The PSP takes a little over 2 hours to charge.  In case you're wondering if it can be used while it's charging (the manual doesn't address this), I heard that you can, but some people say you should be careful the battery doesn't get too hot.  I've never tried it, so I don't know.  I wish the manual would've told me.
The PSP can also play movies, but you must buy the little UMD versions of the movie, and it's supposed to be able to go on the Internet.  Mine had trouble with the Internet.  After a short time, it would say the RAM is low and not go on any more sites.  I don't know if it's just mine or the PSP just has trouble because it's the older version.  If going on the Internet is important to you, you may want to see which version of the PSP is best.

You play as a 'runner' and I'll just leave it at that as I hate divulging too much plot. The aim is basically to get from point A to B as fast as you can. The game eases you in slowly and as you play more you realize that there are multiple ways to get places and to handle enemies.

Overall the game is solid. Looks good, plays good, sounds good. The main complaints would be the graphics, not that they are bad but the setting sometimes look sparse and lifeless.

Most enemies are basic spaceships, but some levels have well-animated living creatures, like the badass water-worm things that slither though level 2. Sadly, even with crazy alien monsters, uber-weapons, 100+ ships and giant bosses, R-Type is a rather unexciting shooter.

I never played any of the old TR games because they just didn't sit well with me. I tried out the first TR and I didn't like it much. After that I ignored TR until Legend came out I played that and I loved the series. With TRA I can finally know how great the first TR was and it IS great! TRA fixes Legend's problems and adds new things in the mix. With great level design and extremely unique and one-of-a-kind puzzles TRA is really something unique. The puzzles aren't to hard to figure out either but I guarantee you will need a FAQ a lot.

The game also supports a gamepad and that's a big plus. It also is one of the 3 games out right now that supports the Xbox 360 controller right out of the box (other 2 are Halo 2 and Shadowrun) so if have a 360 controller I recommend it over the keyboard and mouse! It also supports other gamepads quite nicely. I used my Logitech wireless PS2 controller for this and it recognized the driver right away and all I had to do was remap the keys. One of the main gripes is that it feels the developers didn't completely play test this game since there are sections that are just extremely cheap such as poles or ledges that are off set just a bit and make it difficult to get to.

2760,4.0,"If you have been listening to Peter Molyneux, you know Fable as a non-linear RPG where your character changes according to your playing habits with tons of rival NPCs, a world that changes according to how you play, and plants growing in real time. He also said it would be the BEST RPG of all time!

The development teem must want to murder him, no wonder they lock him in his office during work (this is true).

Fable is far from what Peter said it would be, but the end product is also far from bad.

Graphics. Good graphics, even though the character models do look very cartoonish. Spell effects are especially good. But it does feel like they used this engine for black and white 2, or vise virsa.

Sound. A great soundtrack, good weapon and spell effects. As for the voice acting...""The people of Albion are imigrants from every concieveable point of the British Isles""...That sentence covers it, all NPCs have a heavy British accent.

Gameplay. The combat is great! It fells very believeable and fun. But the game is all about how you progress from little kid to an etremely old battle veteran in 11 hours, this system is actually pretty good, you never notice the ongoing transformation of your character, and he will look appropriately good/evil depending on which path you take. As for non-linear, that is true, but it is not open-ended, and for the most part you are following a predetermined path, with little else to do.

Length. Dissapiontment, it only takes about 10 hours to get through the whole game in one go, of course, you will want to go back in and do it again. It's not really long but the experience is increable.

Story. What would an RPG be without a story? Well, Fable has an excellent story. (No, I am not going to spoil it! Play it for yourself).

All in all, Fable is a great game with gorgeous graphics and a great storyline, but it's a little too short. You could get away with renting it, but mark my words, you will want to play it again.

Graphics 9/10
Gameplay 10/10
Sound 9/10
Length 6/10
Story 8/10
Stability: It's Peter Molyneux's work, its all so extremely polished you can practically see your reflection.

Overall 8/10 - Impressive

2765,4.0,"I know the title may be confusing, how can this keyboard be smaller then standard if it's larger? It's because SteelSeries added macro keys around the sides, in doing so they shrunk the key layout. I'm not a huge gamer, in fact I don't play games but I do have a media server, run linux and do a few other things and typically will use the computer in a dim or not lit room so I really liked the lighted keys. In fact one hobby is lightorama where you sync lights to music and this keyboard adds some extra coolness to that. However, they keys are not where you would think they would be with the extra large plastic trim, extra macro keys, etc. When I type on it, and mind you I use a keyboard all day long for my job I find myself constantly hitting the wrong keys. It takes a little while to settle into this keyboards miniature, yet huge layout.

If you can adapt to the keyboard it's an amazing keyboard. The keys bounce back really nicely but they don't make a loud click noise. I love the configurable LED lights on it and have used the macro keys.

It's a  nice keyboard, I would have liked a more ""standard"" key placement in terms of size to make it easier to adapt to. But it's not a deal breaker. It's really easy to install and the added usb hub on it is very handy for me as I use jump drives all the time so I like being able to plug those right into the keyboard instead of having to connect it to my PC.

I would give this a try if you are looking for this type of keyboard. You probably won't be disappointed.",0.005351806003979916

2775,4.0,"The idea on the game is very cool - command a planetary empire, and not as though it were a bunch of spreadsheets with a lousy GUI (ahem...Master of Orion 3).

The game has three major screens:
* Planetside - in which you build structures, manage power allocation, and fight in tank combat.
* Interstellar - in which you manage your vast fleets.
* Space combat - which can take place between ships or in orbit around one of your or your opponent's planets.

As much as it can be called ""realistic"" the space combat is just that. Attackers must overcome space fleets and planetary-based defenses before landing their attack ships on-planet.

The difficult part of this game is the economy - resources are gathered slowly, buildings are built slowly, and there is a maddening amount of time spent awaiting for these vital generators to do what you need them to do. Resource allocation is different than in the C&C series - it is quite frequent to run out of money, energy, or both, and you can do very little when either of these tickers hits zero.

2776,4.0,"It's good to be bad.

Set years after the original Overlord, Overlord 2 is what it was and more. In essence, you control the Overlord, who in turn control the Minions, lovable little imps who come in four convenient colors - Brown, Green, Red, and Blue, with respective elemental powers. You use these minions to fight magical creatures, and solve puzzles in a quest to defeat the corrupt and powerful Empire.

I'm gonna put this out here right now - Overlord 2 is a vast improvement over the original Overlord and it's expansion, Raising Hell. Except they didn't quite improve enough. To get the unpleasantness out of the way right now, there are numerous noticeable pathing errors, control glitches, and the animations for all characters are, quite frankly, sub par. In this technical age, there is no reason or excuse not to have lips look like they're speaking the correct words. And as much as I hate bringing it up, the game also froze up two times for me. The movement of the Overlord seems floaty and insubstantial, and the minion's AI is a bit stupid (whether this is intentional or not is debatable).

The gameplay is a good mixture of old fashioned RTSing and action game hack-and-slashing. The Brown minions are your basic melee troops, the most durable, and able to pick up and use found weapons and armor. The Reds are your ranged units, shooting fireballs and such, very weak in melee combat. The Greens are stealthy, backstabbing little imps with the ability to cloak, and the Blues are the prerequisite medics, reviving fallen minions. You must use each in your quest

To be honest, the reason I was drawn to Overlord 2 was not that I had played the first one, that I liked action-RTS games, or that I had a subconscious desire to do evil. No, the reason I saw it was because of it's writer, Rhianna Pratchett, daughter of Terry Pratchett. It's nice to see that writing talent, in this case, is hereditary. It's very funny to even walk through a town, and the writing shines in your hideous henchman, Gnarl.

In short, if you like controlling hordes of little gremlins, don't mind a few annoyances, and enjoy the writing of the Pratchett Clan,  you'll like Overlord 2.",0.0254319065042362
2777,4.0,"Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013 lets you take on the role of a big game hunter, tracking deer in forests, tracking lions in savannahs, and more.

You have a rifle-shaped controller that you hold in two hands and point at the screen. The rifle has metal sensors in it so it can feel your pulse. How quickly your heart races affects some shots. You have to remain calm and cool despite wildly charging animals if you want to do well.

I thought the game had great potential. There's a storyline that has you and your competitive brother along with a calm, patient, hunting-minded father. Of course things quickly go awry and soon you're in the thick of things.

It was definitely a game that I loved at first and then things disintegrated quickly. The more hours I played, the more I got into highly improbable scenarios where enormously large packs of hyenas were just deluging me from all sides. This was definitely a time that the heartbeat sensor would have been cool! Could I keep calm while fending off wave after wave of enemy? But unfortunately this is exactly when the game does NOT care what you are feeling. Your heartbeat has no effect at all. That's definitely a shame.

There are the missions where you're simply riding ""shotgun"" and have to shoot things that attack you without controlling direction of motion at all. There are other missions where you are cautiously tracking game through a variety of environments.

The gun control is OK. You don't actually sight down it which is a shame. You just sort of point and hope the calibration is working properly. Most of the time the gun was fairly responsive but of course it gets really annoying when it lags or mis-directs occasionally.

I think the game has great potential, but I think it'll take another release or two before they get all the qualities just right.

The title can be somewhat misleading, and I kind of mistook this game as a take on the familiar game-show ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-You-Smarter-Than-a-5th-Grader/dp/B000UZRWKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?</a>""  I think the types of questions they ask in that game show and on the DS game based on it tend to range from a little harder to much harder.  This program was apparently really designed as a learning aid for younger kids.  It's still a great gift for kids, and here's why.

Other than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spelling-Challenges-and-More/dp/B000QJLQB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spelling Challenges and More</a>, this is one of few such brain games for the DS that is really designed for kids.  So if you can trick your kids into doing some school work through this game, then great.  For somebody like me, who enjoys playing some of these games with my cousins, nieces and nephews, my attention span waned somewhat due to the types of questions.  This is great for kids to play with each other but may be less fun for parents looking for something to play with their kids.

However, there's two sides to that.  The multi-player mode includes both versus and cooperative options.  The versus games really only makes sense between kids, but the cooperative game may be the perfect chance for you to help your younger buddies through some of the tougher challenges.  So in a way, some aspects of this game are very well designed for tutoring.

When I recently picked up Brain Quest 5 & 6, I didn't really have any background with the game series or the educational materials it was based on.  I am not a professional educator.  So from that stand-point, I can't speak to the curriculum, i.e. whether or not this is really material suited for 5th and 6th graders.  What I can say is that testing this out myself and using multi-player (wireless mode) the question difficulty has a wide range.  They seem to start off too easy and then harder questions start to get peppered in.

During most of the ""quiz"" type games, some of these questions seemed too easy.  The quest mode is story-driven, and reminded me somewhat of light version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Professor-Layton-and-the-Curious-Village/dp/B000U5W3IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Professor Layton and the Curious Village</a>.  A quick test of that mode showed that question difficulty can accelerate somewhat quickly. Yet this is not nearly as *fun* of a game.  Some of the introductory scenes and story elements seem drawn out to  me, but they may be perfectly designed for kids.

I didn't work through the game far enough myself for achievements, but it's cool that they put some in here.  Not too many DS games have them.  Similarly, I can't really speak to the advertised ""6,000 question game database.""  But over time, if I find a lot of repetition I will update this review.

One of my favorite things about this game is that it can be a great way to teach your kids Sudoku. In fact, this is one aspect even adults might be able to play.  For those who find Sudoku grids hard to finish, starting on the 4X4 and 6X6 grids lets you work your way up.  Ironically, it seems more like an ""extra"" in this game.  But it's one of the things I enjoyed the most.

Pros:
+ Great idea for a game, making it a no brainer gift for kids 13 and under
+ Nice study aid, covering staples like English, math and science
+ Decent mix of modes and game-play options
+ Quest Mode is like ""Professor Layton - Lite"" with quiz games and puzzles to advance
+ Cooperative game is great for tutoring
+ The Sudoku game gives you various grids for different difficulty levels, including 4x4, 6x6 and 9x9 grids
+ Supposedly large question base (6,000), but only more time will tell
+ Achievements are included to make long-term play more interesting

Cons:
- Somewhat long intro sequences for the quest mode
- Brain mode has questions which seem to start off too easy, IMO

CONCLUSION

This is a great game to give to your young one, and you may be able to help them through some of the problems via the cooperative mode.  As for whether they will pick this game up on their own, it will really depend on their personality.  The brain mode is not as fun as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Brain-Academy/dp/B000EGELQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Brain Academy</a>&nbsp;and the quest mode is not as fun as Professor Layton. So this game is probably light on the *fun* aspect, but you would guess stronger on the learning side.

Like most DS games, the design of this game is well suited for ""15 minutes a day"" type of play.  So give them an incentive and they may very well get hooked on it.  And even if they don't like the quest mode, getting the simpler Sudoku grids is a great way to have them build up to the larger standard 9X9 grid.

To say that those games were lacking is saying it lightly, and thankfully, THQ's new Punisher game lives up to it's license.  With a story written by current Punisher writer and Preacher creator Garth Ennis (with Jimmy Palmiotti), you play as criminal killing vigilante Frank Castle (voiced by the film adaptation's star Tom Jane) on a mission to not only avenge his murdered family, but to punish criminals everywhere.  It's safe to call the game a by the numbers shooter, and the similarities to games such as Max Payne are apparent, but the Punisher proves to be plenty of fun as you can interrogate and ""punish"" crooks and such in some ghastly ways.  The graphics are nicely done, despite some choppiness here and there, and the sound is well done too, including the reprisal of Tom Jane who, even in voice only, proves that he was born to play Frank Castle.  Some of the other voice work is a little flat, and the control scheme can take some getting used to, but once you get past it, the game is plenty of fun.

2783,4.0,"Kids are a great judgement of how fun a game is, and when I brought this and my wii over to my girlfriend's parents house, and played it with her younger siblings, we indeed had great fun.

I have a ps3 and a wii and for me personally the controls on the wii are much more fun to play than smackdown on ps3. I am very happy with the fun factor of this game, the improvements over last years edition (more match types available especially,) and that the controls have been slightly expanded from last year. There's finally enough here to stay interested for a while, whereas last years showed good potential but was just way too basic.

What I dislike about this over the ps3 version, that I find pretty annoying, is that there is no DLC packs for wii owners. Surely if there can be wiiware downloads there can be downloadable content. Why is it that the Wii has been left out of the opportunity to bring in old icons like Big Van Vader and Doink the Clown? As a Wii owner who bought this version of the game I feel insulted that THQ would punish my purchase by not including dlc for wii.

With the DLC I would give this game a 5 because it really is a heck of a lot of fun. My biggest beef with the recent smackdowns on other consoles is I'm not a fan of the controls.

2788,4.0,"This is actually a very good simulator given the age of the software. While the menus and campaign map are a little clumsy by today's standards, lacking the whiz bang effects of say a Total War type title, they are functional.

The graphics are acceptable, again given the age of the software, and most modern computers will run the thing on full specs without too much trouble. The immersive factor really kicks in during aerial combat and I have a new respect for the brave pilots of the era.

The game does a pretty decent job of recreating the pros and cons of diving your Spitfire or Hurricane into a swarm of bombers, which with their numerous defensive turrets are likely to rake your aircraft with machine gun fire. A certain amount of skill is required to bring down a bumber without being cannon fodder yourself, thus lone bumbers broken from the formation are much easier to target.

Then of course there is the fighter support, and being outnumbered is both an advantage as well as a disadvantage. It's a disadvantage in terms of having to watch your six, but it does make it easier to find someone to go after, especially if they're trying to line up another friendly pilot. The right angles and a well aimed burst can quickly put an end to an Me109, but more often than not you'll spend a lot of time trying to get into a firing position for just a split second burst. How those pilots did it in the old days with real g-forces and tricky aircraft to control is incredible.

On this note the AI, both enemy and friendly, is exceptionally well done. The damage modelling is pretty bloody decent, with bits of aircaft flying off as you unleash full bursts. you soon learn to conserve your bursts for just the right distance or you're wasting you time and getting the lead right is intensely exciting, especially to see an enemy go down in flames, or bail out.

I am still getting to grips with the allied aircraft, but the game's longevity of play is increased dramatically by also being able to fly German aircraft. Something for everyone then. The soundFX are a delight as nothing is more pleasing to hear than those old Rolls Royce Merlin engines from the era. If you're a fan of that time period, you won't be disappointed.

Landing the aircraft is a tricky issue and this has been a little bit of a sticky point for me. Admitedly these planes are notoriously difficult to land in real life, due to the tricycle landing gear and that steep angle once it bounces down...but many of the landing strips are difficult to find and beastly to land on due to the poorer ground GFX. It's hard to get a decent depth perception and lie of the land so to speak. The other bug i think is the stall effect, where in steep banks one wing is capable of stalling - which is realistic - flinging the plane into a wild spin. I suspect the modern gfx card with its ability to support physics effects might be the issue. The aircraft sometimes looks like it's a having a manic fit and flails at impossibly unrealistic angles. Still, for the most part the game does an excellent job of visual and audible cues regarding stall characteristics.

Some may find the whole thing a little repetative, but I think that represents the British pilot's experience during the Battle of Britain. Long hours of being on standby and at any moment launching at a moments notice to tackle superior odds sometimes several times a day.",5.2997060287208325e-05
2789,4.0,"I am a huge fan of the original that was on Nintendo. When I heard this was coming out, I was totally excited about all the aspects of it.

However, once I played it, I realized there were quite a few frustrations that I had to overcome just to play the game.

The grappling aspect could have been perfected.  But maybe it was meant to take time to master.  It's not easy, especially when you're floating in the air trying to get Spencer to latch on. Hard man.  Not only that, but the fact that you have to time the swing to propel yourself far enough is tough, but what makes that worse is when you fall, you have to start over from the previous checkpoint, which could be 15 minutes behind where you are.

Sound effects bothered me, especially gun sounds.

The character moves well.  Once you get the hang of the whole swinging, throwing and jumping thing, it will probably be a breeze for you to finish.  The multi-player is cool, too.

The game is exclusive to the N64 and sticks to it as it is one of the coolest WWE/F games ever.  It features some great wrestlers such as Stone Cold and the Rock...duhh...

Not many wrestling games get me to say wow but this game really does earn its ""wow"".  It scores big time with awesome and really incredible matches such as Ladder matches and Cage matches.  Now even though this game is similar to WWf's Wrestlemanio 2000 it is far superior then that as it has better visuals and way better body movement and what is great about

WWf No Mercy is that it has the same exact controls as WWf WrestleMania 2000.  So if you were a Wrestlemanio 2000 addict like myself you will probably get and easy feeling on this game especially how it's more of an ""Update"" of WM 2000 then any other.  The game does earn its rating and I stick by it.  WWF NO MERCY IS ONE OF THE MOST INTENCE WRESTLING GAMES ON THE N64.

Graphicly this game was far more superior then the Smackdown series back on the Playstation.  It had cutting edge body movement and the visuals were just superb.  It really showed what N64 Is made out of and it really is one of a kind.

Gameplay is pretty similar to WrestleManio 2000 and it seems more of an update then anything els.  I can't go into this except say if you knew how to play WM2000 very well then this will be a piece of cake for you.

I don't care to see tiger's (or whoever's) hurrahs or bowed heads after every friggen swing I take. It takes up so much time.

The motion+ is awesome, especially in disc golf. It follows my movements perfectly.  On easy, the game is pretty... well, easy. I made a hole in one on my second game. Thankfully, the harder levels make the game more challenging.",0.0974170274170274

2795,4.0,"""Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones"" is a great Strategy RPG, not just for the GBA but for any system.  This is somewhat unsurprising, since the ""Fire Emblem"" series was developed decades ago and has been a fixture of Nintendo consoles since the original NES.  The first FE to grace our shores was the seventh title in the series, ""Blazing Sword,"" which was released as simply ""Fire Emblem"" here.  That was an excellent, challenging, and quite long game with a first-rate story (although the fact you were an actual character, of sorts, didn't jive with some people).  Nintendo's decision to introduce North Americans to the FE series with that game was, in retrospect, somewhat surprising, since it was actually a prequel to the sixth FE game, ""The Sword of Seals.""  ""The Sacred Stones"" is the eighth game in the series, and this is the one for the mainstream.  You get three difficulty levels right off the bat, the option of choosing two different lords with different stories, and a story that, while still good, is noticeably smaller in scale compared to the epic narrative of the last game.  Even with the three difficulty settings, any seasoned FE player will tell you the real challenge is choosing to abuse or not abuse various aspects of the gameplay.  For example, it is clear in SS that one of the main lords, Ephraim, is probably the strongest lord character yet in a FE game, I'd say even stronger than Hector.  He definitely bucks the trend of ""weak FE lords.""  Eirika, on the other hand, is probably one of the weakest.  You can also use the ""abuse Arena"" trick to quickly level up your characters and buildup funds (something SS really doesn't let you do).  In addition, new gameplay mechanics force the player to enact new choices.  For example, there is a new system in SS where you get to choose which class to change a character to.  Which class is right for that particular character depends mainly on how well you can read their stat levels.  However, some classes are much, some would say too much, better than others.  For example, you can change your pegasus knight into either a falcoknight or a wyvern knight.  Wyverns are known for their good defense against melee weapons but weak resistance against magic.  But, pegasus knights have high resistance.  So, each pegasus knight you change into a wyvern knight gains the aforementioned melee adeptness as well as retains their original high magic resistance.  Another example is the Bishop class.  Many of the enemies you will encounter in SS are monsters.  Bishops gain an ""always-on"" skill called ""Slayer,"" which makes their attacks especially effective against monsters.  Why would you choose any other class?  After all, FE has really always been about, namely, who has the better weapon (although some would say the weapons triangle and trinity of magic makes things a bit too extreme, as what weapon a character wields also affects seemingly unrelated things like evasion).  There is a class, Assassin, that isn't even mentioned in the instruction manual, which is bound to cause confusion among novices.  Speaking of weapons, you will find that, mainly because of who your enemies are, some weapons are just more effective than others.  For examples, in SS, there aren't enough strong enemy axe wielders around, so lances are the most useful of the melee weapons.  As mentioned before, light magic seems to be the most effective, not just because of monsters, but because it always seems to work best against the game-end bosses.  Perhaps this is necessary, as light magic is strong against dark magic, and, of course, evildoers more than likely will be using dark magic.  Even so, the question must be raised: why even have S-rank weapons for every weapon class then?  If only two or three of them are going to be effective for the boss, why have so many at all?  I, for one, don't like the feeling of using my S-rank weapon against a few grunts.  These questions certainly don't just apply to SS.  Something in SS that everyone will, except diehard knight and cavalry fans, agree on is the improved effectiveness of the flying units.  In FE7, the flying units seemed to be really underpowered.  Though I suspect this probably has to do most with the fact there are less enemy archer units in this game, it's still nice to have Vanessa be the one to take down the Demon King in this game instead of watching Florina die over and over and over in the last game.  We'll see what the next FE, a GameCube game called ""Path of Radiance,"" is like, though I hope to see this series go to the DS soon.  Maybe a new character class change system will be implemented where the character will automatically change into a class the game deems it best suited to being, based on combat habits and techniques.

There are no more character intros before starting a boss' level like the first, and it was sad that some of the stages felt unfinished. Like some stages wouldn't even have music and if they did it was the same from the last stage, no more Zaku (the music that they remixed for the stages it the 1st iteration). This game also allowed you to use dual blades but not until the end of the game pretty much which was lame because I thought we would have at least 3 kinds of them. The sad fact is we didn't

2807,4.0,"After the extremely horrific damage to the series known as Sonic 2006 came and went (As well as some other stuff), SEGA was motivated to make ""the best Sonic game ever, even including the Genesis titles"". So, they created some pretty awesome next-gen Sonic gameplay. But then they decided to throw in a mix of a new concept, as well. This time, the gimmick is Sonic turning into a ""Werehog"", a werewolf that is apparently fused with a hedgehog, and he can kill stuff by punching, as well as climb things and stretch his arms. Does it all come together? Keep reading to find out.

Well, I must say. The Sonic gameplay is definitely amazing. It feels a bit weird to shake the Wii Remote to boost (I'm used to the gameplay in Sonic Colors, which is sorta derived from this game's mechanics), but other than that, I was having a blast playing the game. It was truly a thrill to run fast, kill enemies, etc. It's the kind of gameplay that you've always wanted to expect from the hedgehog since the Dreamcast era. Well, of course, not exactly like the Dreamcast games, but I hope you understand my point.

Then, whenever there's a level taking place in the night, Sonic....turns into the Werehog. You know, if it wasn't for this Werehog concept, I would have given this game a straight-up 5 stars. It's not that it was a BAD idea. It just wasn't executed as well. While the normal Sonic levels take a few minutes to beat, Werehog's levels take.....twice or three times as long. That just doesn't seem necessary. Why? Well, there are often times where you have to beat things up. The combat just gets tired and repetitive. It also plays the same music over and over whenever encountering the enemies you're forced to fight to move on...

As for some of the more minor aspects of the game, they are pretty darn well for the most part. The graphics are eye-popping, and the music is fun to listen to (Except for the said music when encountering enemies in Werehog levels). But when it comes to having to talk to villagers before actually playing levels, they just don't seem like they should be there. Why not just have the levels alone? Plus, few say the weirdest lines, such as that kid that is obsessed with eating, of all things.

But overall, if you're on the fence looking for a good Sonic game to play, this can fit the bill. Just try to be able to tolerate the worst the Werehog levels have to offer.",0.025844178251010548

2811,4.0,"I must be honest. I haven't had the *best* experience with SteelSeries mice in the past. Some dodgy build construction and software left me wanting, so when a mouse comes along costing as much as the Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse does, it had better be good.

Pros:

1.) Simple as anything (anything simple!) to set up. Plug the included (braided) micro USB cable into mouse (for wired), or dock (for wireless) usage.

2.) The dock is a very solid affair, by far the nicest part of the package.

3.) Excellent response times. Feels easily as good as my Logitech G700s in terms of latency, - perhaps even a tad better... It can't be overstated how well this mouse responds wirelessly.

4.) Software is simple to configure, on an application-basis or just a system-wide configuration.

5.) Very quiet scroll wheel.

6.) While the light-show from the mouse and dock is pretty cool, they can both be disabled *mostly* completely (I can't seem to disable the light in the scroll wheel, which pulses). On a side-note, it's pretty cool that the mouse has some kind of sensor that knows when your hand is on it, and can shut the light off at that point. Neat!

7.) Surprisingly light considering it has a battery - and a long-lasting one at that.

8.) Easy-to-clean scroll wheel. My Logitech G700s accumulates all kinds of grit in the tiny grooves in the wheel that are a nuisance to remove, so this is a nice change.

Cons:

1.) Not very portable. You have to use the dock as the wireless receiver, so if you need to take your mouse somewhere and want to be wireless, the dock has to come, too. Or at the very least the cable it came with so you can use the mouse wired.

2.) If your mouse battery runs out of juice, you'll need to unplug the cable from the dock and plug it into the Sensei Wireless itself. Normally I'd say just keep an extra micro USB cable lying around, but they won't fit due to the exceptionally narrow cable plastic to plug it in. I have plenty of extra micro USB cables lying around, and none fit!

3.) The scroll wheel doesn't click left or right, which in this day and age of gaming mice seems like an oversight.

4.) Ambidextrous mice tend to mean they don't really fit anyone all that well. The Sensei Wireless is comfortable, but not as comfortable as a G700s.

5.) The DPI button on the top is a pain to press, so you'll need to contort your index finger to get to it when you need to.

6.) The left and right mouse buttons are spread just a tad too far apart, with a fairly large plastic area in the middle. Compared to my Logitech G700s, this means I need to keep my fingers spread just a little further apart than I'd like. I wish SteelSeries had taken the G700s approach, with the left/right mouse buttons wrapping more closely around the scroll wheel.

7.) If you're right-handed, the right-side custom buttons will be utterly useless to you (and vice versa if you're left-handed). This really means that for actual gaming the easily accessible buttons you'll have access to are left click/right click/scroll-wheel-click and the two left-side buttons. That's not a whole lot of buttons - for a whole lot of money.

8.) Slightly questionable coating on the docking station. I have a few areas where the mouse sits that light is bleeding through a little.

9.) The software can be a little finicky. While it works fine when it works, I've already had to re-install it once in Windows 7 because the application refused to open. One other review mentioned this, and I can confirm it happened to me.

10.) The scroll-wheel, while really quiet, is a tad stiffer than I'd like, especially by comparison to the G700s. It can also get ""caught"" between the ratchet points, which feels weird when it happens.

11.) The side parts are glossy plastic, which I don't care for. Just feels slimy...

12.) The top surface, while a matte finish, does tend to pick up grease/fingerprints all too easily. The G700s does none of these things.

13.) You may find the G700s more comfortable. I know I do. There's a small issue with the way the Sensei mouse buttons are designed. On the G700s, the mouse buttons do not go out to the very edge of the mouse. There's a frame in which the mouse buttons are placed. On the Sensei the buttons do go out to the edge of the mouse (they look like they have a glossy frame, but the glossy frame is actually part of the mouse buttons themselves). The problem with this is that my ring ringer rests on the edge of the mouse, as it should. That means, though, when I right click with my middle finger, the right mouse button rubs against the edge of my ring finger (it's basically trapping my ring finger's skin like catching your finger in a door..). I do find this annoying, and think it's an actual design flaw with the mouse.

14.) No way to replace the internal battery.

15.) That price.

While it sounds like a laundry list of things that are bad about the Sensei, it's a decent mouse. It looks great, feels reasonably nice  in the hand (for an ambi mouse) and the dock is so very convenient to drop the mouse into at the end of a long clicking day.

The biggest problem is that the Logitech G700s exists, and is a fraction of the price. Logitech's software isn't great (SteelSeries' is much *cleaner* looking - when it works), but with the G700s you do get a dedicated, more comfortable right-hand setup with easier to access buttons on the left side (and more of them!). And, you can replace the battery!

For you lefties out there, though, take a good look at this SteelSeries. If you can get past the price, it's not bad.

Maybe even better than pretty well. Shifting shoulders left or right changes the dirction of your character and is very responsive. It does take a little time to get used to how far to turn or you might over compensate and head in the opposite direction. There are four basic moves: turning, walking, slashing, and interacting with onscreen icons. However, and this is where the surprise and fun comes into play, sometimes you're prompted to run, swim, duck, climb, push, and even rub your arms to remove unwanted leeches. There is such a variation that gameplay is never dull. If people are finding the game unresponsive to their gestures, I can assure you it is because of the conditions they are working with the kinect, not the game. I started it last night and played 90 straight minutes. In those minutes, I actually broke a light sweat and felt some degree of tiredness - the game keeps you moving (and I am an avid runner/cyclist so I don't tire easily).

2817,4.0,"It is a shame that there are so many 1 and 2 star reviews for this game from people who don't know how to use digital downloads. How about you learn something and stop trashing a game you haven't even played?? Anyway, This was on sale for digital download (PC) on Gamefly a little while back for $10 and it has proven well beyond worth it. This game is a good mash-up of both classic and new Sonic and is a lot of fun to play, offering tons of variety. They offer some replay value as well by timing and grading your runs through levels, so you can go back and try to beat your last score.

2818,4.0,"This game is highly entertaining. Nothing is slow. You just blast your way through one obstacle after another, with no pit-stops in between. It will rapidly eat up the hours of your day. If you're not in Vice City making a daily consistency of 5,000, you're stealing your favorite cars right off the streets, and leaving their owners to bite the dust.
You've served your time in jail, and now you're back on the streets not about to live a normal life. Instead, you return to doing services for your old Boss in NEW YORK, who is head of a Mafia division, and he sends you on down to MIAMI FLORIDA because that's where all the gold is nowadays. It's 1980 and drugs are in high demand. They've got to be shipped from somewhere overseas, and what better a place if not VICE CITY? You, Tommy Vercettie, go there to pick up some 'Grade A Colombian.' But little do you know that your Boss, Sonny, is setting you up. He wants you out of the way, and out of sight. Evidently, you angered a lot of people before you went to jail, and to be seen working with you would be detrimental to business.
This game has the most elaborated digital city I have ever seen on the PS2. People skating along the beach side. Old fogies waiting for city buses. People fighting. People arguing. Street lights changing from green-to-red. Stop and go traffic. Police chasing down criminals. Gang shoot-outs. You can even fly in a helicopter and spot a few sharks or turtles swimming in any given area of the ocean. And whoever designed it sure did their homework, for this city really does look like Miami Beach, and the people in it act accordingly, from the Haitians to the Cubans, from the city red-necks to the bikers - all of whom you will work with temporarily, and kill later, as you slowly sneak your way into the center of all the corruption, where you can begin to construct your thrown.
The graphics are much better than GTA3. Sun glare through windows onto marble floors, reflecting, getting dimmer as day turns to night. I liked the ultra 3D effect when it rains - how some drops splatter on the TV screen when you drive really fast. Not to mention when you cut someone up with a chainsaw. Just the overall definition of every image was superb.
The gameplay could be better. Although the missions were highly anticipating, I thought a good number of them were outrageously hard. No one wants to die, die, and die again. I'm all for a challenge here, but I would enjoy myself a whole lot more if my playing skills didn't require sheer luck to beat some of these ridiculous missions. All missions were challenging, forcing me to play them in multiple ways to win, and I like that a lot, but come on, be reasonable. I also didn't like the fact that the only way Tommy knew how to kill, was by firing a gun. Wouldn't it be great if you had ways of silently murdering individuals without ever alerting the cops or FBI, but at the same time, also have the option to just go on a raging killing spree? How many times can a man out-run a horde of cops before he gets thrown in jail? Just because I out run them to my house doesn't mean they're going to give up on me. This isn't a game of tag here - I JUST KILLED 30 or 40 PEOPLE! I remember shooting up a mall. My mission was to destroy every window display. Cops and everyone was running after me until I destroyed the last window on the list. Then they just turned their backs on me and walked away as if nothing had happened. Some things like that make the game so unrealistic. What's wrong with visiting the mall as a casual customer and having to plant bombs when security isn't looking? That can be equally as challenging. But even these minor delays can't overthrow the entire game, which for the most part, was really entertaining. There's nothing like taking over a city by force, and making everyone fear you. That is, after all, your main objective.
Your Character is cool. Really temper-mental. Walks a little funny, but that's for having too big a package for such tight pants. For a guy that does so many wrong things, he sure looks like a dork. Doesn't have that cold, mean-steak about him that the guy in GTA3 had.
The Radio Stations: While you're driving in your `stolen' vehicles, all radio stations, which you can tuner, has 80s music. You can not go wrong with 80s music. And we're not just talking high squeaky singers with hair saturated with color-coated gels. In this game you hear what RAP was, before it became what RAP is today...and a few talk-shows. Gotta love GTA talk shows. This game seems to mock every human clich ever created in American society, from animal conservationists, to Wiccans, to Goths, to people who complain that games are too violent. Nothing makes me more excited than listening to some moral enthusiast speak against violence on the radio while I stick my Uzi out the car window and sever people in half with a spray of BULLETS!
This game is not for children. Besides the fact that you DO commit every crime known to man, this game has the 3 most vulgar words: The D word, the P word, and the F word. The only crime you don't commit is rape or molestation. Well, that's if you don't include picking up alleyway whores and then shooting them in the back of the head after they served their purpose, to only get back your money, and the money of their previous clients.

2820,4.0,"I used to have MFSX Gold way back but my copy of that was damaged & people are asking way too much for MFSX Gold so MFS 2004 A Century of Flight was my only option other than Steam. I'm not a big fan of Steam as I like to have a disk copy just in case.

It installed fairly well aside from a few missing sceneries which didn't effect the game much. There was a problem I was having when I first tried to start the game. It wasn't the games fault it was a security update from September 2015 on Windows 7. It was the update KB0386255 that was preventing me from launching the game but after a few adjustments to the settings & a quick uninstall of the faulty Windows update it works pretty well. Only crashed on me once.

For what it is, it's allot of fun. You get to chose between 25 aircraft including 2 helicopters & the famous wright flyer that made the first American documented powered flight at Kitty Hawk. You get to fly anywhere in the world which is one of the best parts of the game. Although it is a tad glitchy & graphics are a bit dated but the assortment of aircraft & the whole world at your computer makes up for it.

My copy was used & open. The case was slightly ripped but fixed with some clear tape. There were few very minor scratches on some of the disks but it didn't effect the games Installation or performance at all. Shipping was pretty fast to. The condition is understandable considering this game is used roughly & 12 years old. But with Steam games & other game companies looking to go diskless its getting harder & harder to find CD copies of older computer games.

The price was right to. I only payed a little over $20 for my copy. Other idiots are charging almost $200 or more for MFSX Gold which is strong on robery if you ask me. A game like themis for around $20 is a real bargain & definantly a more honest price. People overvaluing CD copies of old games are just looking to make money off of suckers.

In both your character hovers around the foreground of the screen shooting everything that gets in your way.

By no means is this meant as an insult.  The game plays wonderfully.  The plot is nonsense and poor acted nonsense at that, but who cares?  There are lots of things to shoot and lots shooting at you.

The other major improvement over Cabal (or the first S&P for that matter) is the inclusion of IR aiming.  Twitch gaming is made that much more precise with that addition.

How much fun you get out of it squarely lies on how you feel about games like Cabal, Wild Guns or the original S&P.  If you are a fan, this is the ultimate next-gen version of those classics.",-0.0025358479903934456
2823,4.0,"Putting aside the debate as to whether or not the PS2 SHOULD have included more controller ports, one needs to accept the fact that it only comes with 2.
I like the MultiTap in that it is made by SONY itself, and is both reliable and durable.  I only give it 4 stars because the short cord makes it difficult for those of us who prefer to have our PS2 stored on the second shelf of a cabinet (I have to put a small table underneath to keep the weight of the MultiTap from damaging the input slot).
I would have preferred either a plug in piece that adheres to the front of the PS2 (perhaps uding both controller ports for support) or a much longer cord.  As it stands now, I may have to buy a controller extension cord to correct this design flaw, which is irritating when I already paid for the MultiTap.
It works, it's first party, and it's reliable.  Hopefully the PS3 will take advantage of the wireless revolution and the cord issue will be a thing of the past!",0.05654675663368796

2827,4.0,"Just Cause 2: Just cause.. i can. A game where you blow sh! t up, and cause devastation throughout Panau

I have owned Just Cause 2 before, but that copy broke, so i bought a used copy from Amazon.
First of all, this game is complete mayhem and craziness. Anyone who like GTA or Saints Row really needs to try this insane sandbox game. The Gameplay is a huge improvement from its predecessor, where you are able to use a grappling hook/whip. The world of Panau is brilliant and beautiful. The story, unfortunately, lacks quality or much sense. Overall, it's a great game to mess around in.

I did not give this game a perfect review because of some flaw in the disk. I bought my copy from a third-party company, which seemed to be legitimate, as they actually were. The game played smoothly like any other disk you would buy, however, this one copy had an issue with DLC. I had bought some DLC for Just Cause 2 previously, which worked fine with my old copy before it broke. This copy however, did not recognize the DLC at all. I would buy about $5 worth of DLC, and find out that it never loads it up in the game, which is extremely frustrating. It's a small flaw, but i guess the moral of the story is to be extra careful where you buy your games.
Lastly, it is a wonderful sandbox game that really catches people's eyes.

PROS:
-Amazing gameplay
-Stunning world of Panau
-Lots to do with various missions and collectibles.

Cons::
-Poor cliche story with unsettling voice acting
-quite a few small glitches
-If you buy from a third party- just be careful what you get..",-0.012914330251791556

2835,4.0,"Campaign:  The storyline presents itself so much better than in SC1, its absolutely epic.  The single player campaign is a fully fleshed out experience separate from multiplay.  Being able to research different trees of tech in the single player makes it a very different game from multiplay and allows you to build to your playstyle.  Its going to take 2 or 3 plays to experiece all the units and abilities that customize each unit in the terran missions along with branching storylines. Finally finishing it today has left me with NO DOUBT that blizzard took the right direction in crafting SC2.  To squeeze in any other race and reduce the terran missions, tech, units, and story or try and add in a full 60 more missions with the same bonus material would have been a HUGE mistake.  It would have been like squeezing the entire LOTR saga into a 2 hour movie or on the other end try and watch it or read it all in one sitting.

CON: I do take issue with the fact that I lose the achievements I've been working hard for during a mission if the [] server in Cali or wherever goes down.  It happens and its a waste.  Considering that all other games I own that have single play let me earn achievements offline I consider this a step back and a half star deduction.  Take note that any ai skirmishes you don't organize online don't count for anything either.

Mulitplay:  I haven't been so anxious and pumped with adrenaline since my first multiplayer match ever on C&C Red Alert.  Multiplay excites like I thought no game ever could again.  [] is a lot lot lot friendlier place for non-hardcore RTS players like myself with seperate rankings allowing you to play similar skilled people, lets hope it continues to be such.  It also compensates for lag or is very smooth, either way I've had very little connection complaints.  Games with friends are easy to set up and quite enjoyable, just like the good ol lan days.  Speaking of which:

CON: SC2 has no LAN play and don't be ridiculous in thinking they're adding it in with any of the future STORY ADDITIONS.  If they don't have it in they don't want it in.  And if they want to do that its their choice but I do mark them off half a star for the fact that compared with older games I play at home with my wife SC2 isn't as fast(yet still fairly smooth) since it has to relay from a server out of state.  If it was just as fast as a 0 lag game I play over my network I wouldn't care.  I consider that another backwards step in technology.

DVD & Box:  Came with a nice little bonus, a wanted poster notepad of James Raynor.  Theres nothing like a blizzard box, but in the end the disk is only saving you the download time it takes to get it off the net, all your really buying is the game Key which you attach to your [] account.  Total Big Brother on this deal.  Like everyone says, offline all you can do is skirmish a bit and play the campaign without saving.  On the pro side you can bring up your account on any computer with Starcraft 2 installed on it.  And I believe you can sell this game off: but you'd have to sell your account too and any connected Blizzard game stuff (like WOW chars) associated.

2841,4.0,"The Setup (Overview):

The land is dying. Inch by inch is slowly being consumed by desert.  The source of the corruption is the remains of ancient empire that used to rule the continent a thousand years ago.  The ancient empire attempted a experiment that would have boosted the power of mana, the source of life and magic in the land, but something went terribly wrong and the empire was destroyed almost over night.  Ever since the corruption has been spreading from the site of the experiment.

From the ruins of that empire, four different nations emerged. Allistel, Granorg, The Beast Nation, and the rough and tumble desert wanders.  As the land turned to desert the fight for resources and fertile land led to open conflict among the groups.  Eventually this turned into a war of total domination for Allistel and Granog, with everyone else caught in the middle.  Allistel is led by a cruel queen and Granorg is directed by the word of a hermit like prophet and controlled by a power hungry general.

You play as Stocke, a agent for the special operations arm of the Allistel army.  Your story begins on what should be a routine meet and escort mission.  Except it doesn't quite go the way you planned...

The Story(Some Story Details):
Stocke fails.  The informant is killed and so is Stocke's team.  Stocke fight's to the death, but there is no way he can overcome the enemy forces.  As his vision fades the last thing he sees is the crumpled bodies of his team mates.

Except he wakes up again.  He finds himself in a strange place of floating stair ways and closed doors. He also see's two children standing in front of him.  They tell him that history is broken and that they can give him the power to set it right.  They tell him that he can go back and save his team, but that will only be the beginning.  Someone is altering history for their own ends, which always ends with the world turning completely to desert.  Not sure whether he is hallucinating or not Stocke accepts their proposal and finds himself back with his team before they chose the wrong path that led to their deaths. Except this time he has the Historia, a book that was given to him by the children, that allows him to travel through time.

Armed with the knowledge of what went wrong Stocke is able to complete his mission and return to Allistel with his team still alive.  He would swear that he just had a nightmare, except that he still has the strange book.  Then the children appear again.  They tell him that he will soon have to make a major choice and from that point there will be two different time lines.  The true history and the alternate history.

If he wants to save the land then he must travel between the two histories in order to find the correct path to stopping the spreading desert.  It won't be easy though.  Each history affects the other, what seems like a good path often can end in utter disaster.  Stocke must also contend with whatever or whoever is changing history using a power similar to his.  Stocke's only edge is that he can return to Historia to live again and hopefully find the right way forward and stop the endless desert from becoming reality.

Conclusion(My Overall Opinion on the Story):

This is a old fashioned game that has a neat story that made me want to see what happened in the end. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout the story and the game kept me guessing till the end on who the real villain was.  The combat system, for the most part, is interesting and keeps the battles fresh. There are also plenty of things to collect and quite a few side quests for the player to track down and complete.

I only had couple of  small problems with this game.

The first problem is that the pacing can be a bit off in some areas when the story doesn't quite explain what it want's the player to do.  This only happened in a couple of instances and it usually involved instances where I thought I should win but the developers neglected to point out in some way that I was intended to lose.  Not a big deal after searching the internet a bit for a guide, but still annoying.

The second problem I had was just another small annoyance and that was with the combat system.  The combat system basically lets you move, most, enemies together so that you can deal damage to multiple enemies at once.  The only problem I had was that later in the game this can slow combat down a bit with either enemies that cannot be moved or enemies that are resistant to certain attacks.  In my case I just switched to party that had one character that had a few arts that could move enemies, while the other two hit really hard with magic or strength attacks.

Overall this is a neat little game that anyone who likes time travel stories and JRPG's should take a look at.",-0.037820920170375034

2843,4.0,"This is a collection of games and a balance board you use with the Wii to keep yourself toned up.

2848,4.0,"I bought PSTV to mainly play Vita games.  I have a pretty good selection, and it plays them well.  They look surprisingly good blown up on my 46"" TV.

The only caveat is that not every game is supported. I am hoping that Sony supports more games as time goes on.

For a list of Vita games and apps compatible with PSTV, on Google search for ""PlayStation TV Compatible Games (North America)"". I would post a link here but Amazon removed the link from my original review.

You will need a memory card if you are downloading games.  The system comes with 1 GB built in.

I also have a bunch of old digital-download PSP games that work on PSTV.  Honestly, as I thought they would, they look a bit blurry blown up on the TV given the PSP's original low resolution.  But it's understandable and they do play fine. When I increased the PSTV resolution to 1080 instead of the default 720 the PSP games looked a bit sharper. Again check the list for supported PSP games.

Minecraft Notes: There is a fully compatible Vita version of Minecraft that works great on Playstation TV.  So if you or your kids are into it, there really is no less expensive option to play Minecraft than PSTV.  (Certainly less expensive than most tablets, computers and consoles).

If you have a PSTV and a PS3 or PS4, Minecraft games can be started on one system, saved and continued on the other.

The PSTV version of Minecraft does not support multiplayer split-screen like the PS3/4 versions do. That's because you are essentially playing a handheld single-player game on your TV. It does support networked multiplayer between PSTVs or Vitas, although I have not tried that yet.

Update Jan-2017: I finally got a PS4 so I was able to test out remote play. I have my PS4 in the basement and the PS TV upstairs. Both are hardwired into my network.

Let me tell you, remote play works far better than I thought it would! It's nearly lag free. (Note: In the PS Link app I have the framerate set to High to avoid frame drops.)

Now I can play Minecraft on the PSTV directly from the PS4 version. No longer need to save my progress on the PS4 and transfer it to the PSTV. Other PS4 games work well too in remote play. It's a great feature.",0.06514300584509314

2859,4.0,"Let me start off by saying that I fully agree with the mixed reviews.  I fully enjoyed the game, but found many annoying things in it, as well.  Will you like it?  If you enjoyed Spider-Man 2 and Ultimate Spider-Man, then yes.  Spider-Man 3 plays a lot like both games with respect to the third movie and a few other villains that are added just like in the previous Spider-Man games.

The game feels very rushed--far too many loading screens (which not only take away from the game's pace, but also cuts-off a lot of dialog), a few glitches (landing on the ground right up against some buildings will make you fall through the ground and into nothingness causing the game to automatically reset/restart missions, people walking through objects), poor sub-missions (the ""City on Alert"" missions are easy, but tacky--delivering a pie to only later have to save the pie from being kidnapped?  Are you kidding me?), and mediocre voice acting add to the bad reviews.

The game's main plot follows the Spider-man 3 movie fairly close in terms of what to do and length of gameplay (movie plot only lasts for a few hours--far too short).  There is a sub-plot as you follow the path of the Lizard.  This sub-plot is about as lenghty as the main plot, but does add well to the game and gives you more bosses to battle.  The only negative here with the Lizard in this game is that I am hearing that the fourth movie will be based on the Lizard as the main villain.  That kind of eats at any Spider-man 4 the game ideas and originality.

The game engine is familiar as the game-play is very similar to Spider-Man 2.  A few things were taken out (sprinting, slow-mo spider-sense), but the added ability to fight in the black suit not only adds to the fun, but also adds to your strategy as you can't fight in the black suit all day or it will knock you out and cause you to fail your mission if you fight too much with it on at one time.  Fighting is basic button mashing, but add-ones and upgrades are available to purchase with your hero experience points (sound familiar).  The movie plot is obviously in the game, but you can pretty much go your own path and fight some of the other villains (like the Lizard) in the game whenever you choose.

Graphically, the game looks quite good.  It's a tad cartoon-ish, but Spider-Man is based off a comic book; therefore, personally, I didn't mind the looks of the game at all.  Voice acting is good, with the exception of James Franco (Harry Osborne/Goblin).  He needs a serious lesson in doing voice-overs.  Cameras and controls are a tad rough at times, but if you didn't mind them in previous Spider-Man games, then you won't have a problem here, either.

Also added is the timed action button sequences (ala RE4 or the God of War games) where a button symbol shows on the screen and you have to press that corresponding button as soon as it shows or you take damage.  However, where it's a nice addition, it's not done well--you have what seems like all day to press the correct button, wait a minute, and then press another button.  If these sequences were sped up to the pace like in the GoW games, then this would be a welcome addition.  Since it's not done well, this just adds to the ""game feels rushed"" negatives.

Overall, the game is quite solid.  It was rushed to join the movie release, but it is enjoyable and worth a purchase.  Take the good with the bad and you will enjoy yourself with Spider-man 3.",0.03906880435811659

2861,4.0,"Okay I've been anticipating this title about as much as I was anticipating AC3. What can I say, I'm an Assassin's Creed nut and I was really excited for a game I have a genuine interest in on the Vita.

Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation does on the PsVita basically what Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines did on the PSP, only in my opinion, not as well as Bloodlines. Liberation is a better game in every way, except for gameplay. The problem is that some of the games most used commands don't work like they're supposed to. The counter/parry command only works some of the time, the free run kinda sends you leaping off to the wrong thing more often than the right thing. Traveling out of the current memories boundaries leaves you trapped on the other side of the wall until the game just resets you for being desynchronized, enemies can somehow spot you through walls. But however, this games biggest flaw is the Persona system, yes it makes sense from a story aspect but insofar as fun fulfilling game play on a portable console this is not what I need from a game. I need something that pops that can make me feel like I've accomplished a lot in the short period of time I've played it because that's what I do with my portable systems, I take them to the laundry mat or on a bus ride or in a car ride. But when I have to spend 30 minutes of my time and my handhelds battery life 'walking' the streets of New Orleans in the Lady Persona, virtually unable to fight and totally unable to sprint or climb because that's how the mission dictates it need be completed, it grinds my enjoyment of the game to a hault. To the point where I just turned the game off and just played some Super Stardust Delta instead.

I picked it back up finished the mission only to get in a fight and realize you're pretty much defenseless unless you wear Aveline's assassin garb which comes with a constant level of notoriety and you will trigger a fight virtually every time a guard sees you.
Locomotion suffers from the same bugs and glitches that are so prevalent in Assassin's Creed 3 so if you've been playing that you'll alread be familiar with that buggy new engine that they've put in place for both of these games. Honestly, considering this is a handheld and has so many control options built into it I would have preferred they use the AC2 engine instead. It's tried, it's tested and most importantly they had pretty much worked all the kinks out by the time Revelations came along.

I know I've made this game sound really terrible but it's not all bad I'm gradually coming around to the slower paced game play and I'm hopeful they'll get a patch out for some of the bugs and glitchyness. But to be honest, I own 8 PsVita titles and most of them have only been patched once, and the first thing I did after I downloaded this game was refresh the live area and download a patch, and then the developers kinda abandon them, hopefully there will be enough interest in this game to at least get them to iron most of the kinks out.

The good of this game is that it is an Assassin's Creed game right in a handheld, all the running through trees, performing assassinations with any equipped weapon, tree climbing/parkouring from Assassin's Creed 3 is all here in this game. The story is interesting in a historical sense just like every other AC game, the city and the bayou are beautiful detailed maps and I'm really interested to see how much further the game is going to take me. Sound get's a little wonky at times with the music and ambient noises dropping out to nothing randomly. The touch screen controls for map and inventory are very convenient and don't feel tacked on in any way to me personally.
This is probably the best Vita game I own and I'm just being hard on it because I expected nothing less than perfection. Is it perfect? No. But was this game worth my money? Yes.",0.03333009464195517
2862,4.0,"I had never played or heard of Animal Crossing (its also available on the Nintendo DS) before I played it ""Animal Crossing:  City Folk"" on the Wii.  It is a game that is Wi-Fi compatible and can be played with the Microphone, but it doesn't have to be.  I played this game by myself, without the microphone or transferring any game data from the DS version, and found it fun.  It reminds me of a Sim game for kids, like The Sims but a younger and brighter version!
You basically build, buy, and design items.  I let my sister start off the game and get the town started and then I jumped in and played.  When I first started I decided to live in her town and after a lot of dialogue with the game character (you can't skip it either) I finally started the game. I picked a house and then from there I was assigned tasks, such as go talk to this person or visit this location.  You have to be nice to the different characters or they won't be nice back and you even have to recycle! Oh and you even have to work to make money to pay your house, upgrades, and other items.
The game has a lot of different interesting sounds to it through music and animal talk (not quite English but a made up language.  I found exploring the city quite easy and you just point and your character walks.
This game is not an action packed game or one where you have to really bad guys, but rather it is a game of exploring and interacting.  My boys love to watch me play and see the different animal characters as well as the makeovers I do.  I think it would be really fun playing with someone else of the WiFi / microphone connection but I don't know anyone else on it.  Even without it though the game is fun and I am constantly finding something I hadn't found before!  It is easy and simple but yet different and family-friendly.",0.04553093964858671

2866,4.0,"I bought myself a used Dreamcast last year, and so far Rayman 2 has been one of the best games I have for it.

For fans of the Playstation version, it is a slight disappointment that there aren't actual voices for the cutscenes, which was something that added to the game.

There are some better things about it, though.  For one, the frames per second is 60, as oppose to the PS1 version's 30.  The graphics are very sharp, and the animation is very well done.

The levels are slightly different than its Playstation counterpart, and involves more maneuvers and features.  Also, there is an exclusive multiplayer level found only on the Dreamcast version.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who still has a working Dreamcast.  Oh, and it only takes up two blocks of memory space on the VMU, so memory is not an issue.  Unless you only have one block.",0.027549019607843138

2868,4.0,"Explosions, chaos, destruction, mayhem, rumbling vehicles and mutants galore -- Auto Assault delivers on full-fledged action in a game that borders on being a niche hit of the year.

The reality is, the game has a wide appeal to gamers of many sorts though it does lack some polish (for some that stands as part of the attraction to the game) and needs some additions to bring it into a fully developed offering. Despite its minor failings the game is surprisingly well done and manages to offer some features that simply cannot be found in any other competing game.

Perhaps even more surprising is the setting. NetDevil (the developer) has conjured up a solid foundation for a role playing game, MMO or not. More importantly, they have delivered on their setting by providing three races and a world that captures the variance and flavor it all in astounding color and depth and futuristic chaos.

Of course, the setting begins to shine as you overcome the mild learning curve and realize that the game holds a huge amount of depth beyond the extremely addictive ""Mad Max"" style of game play. Combined with an intricate crafting system, tournaments and PvP Arenas, the massive world to explore and literally destroy at every turn makes for the sort of addictive play found only in the likes of games made by giants such as Blizzard. If you found yourself spending vast amounts of time pouring over a game like Diablo or WoW, chances are this game will also sink its hooks into you in a way that you haven't experienced for a long time.

It's difficult to sumarize the many influences that can be seen in the game. For example, at times while speeding across tattered highways or blazing into some ""Pike"" stronghold (a group of crazed humans who scrap together junk in attempts to fend off invaders of every type, including players), the undeniable sense of influence from other games will wash over you. At some points you might half imagine you are playing in one of City of Heroes more destroyed and hazardous regions, for example.

There is little doubt that the experience of PlayNC and their growing umbrella of MMO's have been borrowed from in a myriad of ways for Auto Assault. That is, in part, what makes this game a success. They have managed to extract ""what works"" from other games they have dealt with and, at the same time, created an all new style and mode of MMO gameplay that is at least as enticing and entertaining as anything else on the market. For one thing, it seems well balanced whether you look to solo/co-op play or within the PvP arena.

Having said that, if going absolutely beserk and being able to destroy virtually everything you come across in the world (beyond just the enemies ... we're talking about ruins, forts, cities, pretty much everything), if that sort of thing doesn't hold any appeal to you then neither will this game. It has an edgy and warped flavor that might not hold the interest of everyone, but for those who find the setting and notion of driving Mad Max styled vehicles into a forboding and troubled post-apocalyptic word, well, this game certainly demands a run behind the wheel.

Happily to suit, the developers have been active and involved -- they really seem to have an interest in this game and it shows through interactions on the forums. That bodes well for the future of the game and for the ongoing enjoyment of the players there. It also signals that some of the things the game does need work on are being addressed.

Overall, I'd recommend the game to most anyone -- certainly a month of playing it will reveal whether it is not to your taste or whether you have become hopelessly addicted. I might add, it is fantastic for solo play and is even more fun when you get a convoy of destruction minded friends to join you. Of all the problems the game has, the ""Convoy"" (read ""Group"" from other MMO's) matching system they have in place does need some improvements to make it easier to find and get into a convoy, but I haven't had a lot of problem so far finding others to group with.

With fun game play, stable servers, a well crafted setting and more mayhem and destruction than any MMO available, its hard to think that NetDevil and PlayNC don't have something on their hands worth pushing harder than they have. Plain and simple, its a fun game!",0.018886184469731285

Largely because the insane difficulty is largely absent. Little, if any, grinding is required. Mr. Genji Hands are given out at the beginning of every item level, so that big sense of risk is gone. Sadly, the developers made this game much more accessible to a new generation of gamers at the expense of the diehards like me who embraced the punishing difficulty of the first.

The core game play was lots of fun and the game environment is staggering in detail and scope. I thought it was a more interesting game than Oblivion, if only the game were as smooth and polished as Oblivion! The fact is this game is a victim of sloppy programing that allows way too many bugs and glitches with an overall performance that makes it a contender for the most half baked game ever shipped.

However, the game has seen several patches since release but none have been able to bring the shabby code up to AAA quality. I don't even know if that would be possible since the game is so deeply flawed. The game is playable but it takes patience and and a devoted gamer who is willing to overlook the games technical short comings and appreciate the games hidden potential.

2881,4.0,"This review was written when the game was first released.

""Metroid Prime"" is a game whose release has finally connected the Metroid series to the new age of gaming. The star of the series is Samus Aran, a bounty hunter who, actually, is never seen doing that much bounty hunting. She is more of just an ""alien hunter"" rather than a bounty hunter, but ""bounty hunter"" sounds cooler.

So, anyways, Samus the ""bounty hunter"" is orphaned from an attack by Space Pirates, who aren't really pirates, just a race of ""interstellar nomads"", as the manual says. So after the space pirates zap Samus' planet, they go and build a huge research complex on the planet Zebes, wiping out most of the native population. They are researching these creatures called ""Metroids"", which had been recently discovered by the Galactic Federation.

The Space Pirates stayed there for a couple years, researching Metroids, finding new and exciting ways to blow people up, when who should arrive but Samus Aran. She had somehow avoided being blown up along with the rest of her planet's population and had been raised by the Chozo, a bird-like race of creatures. It turns out Zebes had, before the Space Pirates moved in, been a Chozo colony! Whoops! So, the Chozo, being annoyed that a world's worth of their people had been blasted into itty-bitty pieces, they infused Samus with some Chozo blood (giving her super strength, endurance, and speed), gave her a power suit with a gun-arm attached to it, and told her to go smite the Space Pirates until there weren't any space pirates left to smite.

So Samus blasted her way through them, cutting a bloody swath through their operation and even getting the captain, Ridley, and their giant spike-shooting reptile friend, Kraid. Eventually she got to the inner sanctum of the operation, and blasted every Metroid she could find. Finally, she got to the Brain of the Metroids, the Mother Brain, and she blasted that too. So, thinking her job was done, she went to look for the Chozo, who had for some reason gone into hiding.

But the Space Pirates weren't done yet. The survivors immediately split into two groups. Group One returned to Zebes to resuscitate Mother Brain, Kraid, and Ridley. Group Two went off looking for a new planet to make a base on. They found Tallon IV, a planet that had been a Chozo colony until a meteor brought some freaky mutating stuff called ""Phazon"" that drove most of the Chozo to leave. Before they left, figuring it was the most they could do, the Chozo sealed the meteor off with a temple and split its core, sealing the pieces away. By that time, it was too late for the planet. Plants and animals had been mutated into hideous forms, the ecosystem was completely trashed, and basically the planet was one big nuclear mess. The pirates come across it and decide it's the PERFECT place to live, what with the new experiments they can perform on the little nuclear beasties and such. They leave their ship in orbit so they can send things up and perform ""Zero-G experiments"" on them. Samus finds them, lands on their frigate, and that's where the game starts up. Undoubtedly, there are a few holes in this story, such as: where did she get her ship? It was not mentioned, but in the game, it says it is, ""Registered to Samus Aran."" So where did she get it registered? And why is she called a Bounty Hunter? These are just some of the many story-loopholes in this game.

The reason I said that Metroid Prime connected Metroid to the new age is because, unlike the Kirby, Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Donkey Kong series, Metroid did NOT have its own game on the N64. Sure, there was Super Smash Brothers, but that was only a cameo role. There have been only four Metroid games so far: Metroid, for the NES, Metroid II: Return of Samus for the Game Boy, and Super Metroid for the SNES. The last one was made in 1994. Metroid fans have gone 8 YEARS without another Metroid game, and now they get it. And it was worth the wait. Metroid Prime is very well done. In their update to the New Era, many games, mostly side-scrollers like Mario or adventure games like The Legend of Zelda, took the ""Third-Person camera"" view, with the camera following behind the character. However, ruling that a 3rd Person shooting game (not adventure, it's SHOOTING!) would be kind of annoying, the Metroid Prime design team decided to make it a First-Person shooter. And by golly, it worked.

One of the main differences between this game and other First-Person Shooters is that Metroid Prime has only four types of beam weapons, along with missiles. Most other FPSs have a huge arsenal of weapons, ranging from basic pistols to shotguns to Hi-Tech lasers to guided rocket launchers. Not this game. A basic blaster, an electric wave beam, an ice beam, and a plasma beam are all you get. And even though there are only five types of weapon, this game is anything but boring. Along with the four beam guns, you also get four visors: A basic ""Combat Visor"", a ""Scan Visor"", a heat-tracking ""Thermal Visor"", and an ""X-Ray Visor"". The Combat Visor is just the normal interface, seeing the world without special goggles. It does, like all the other visors, feature a Heads Up Display, showing health, missiles and a special Danger Level monitor, which goes up when you are near hazards like lava or poison gas.

The Scan Visor, the only visor where you cannot shoot, serves another useful purpose: scanning objects and enemies. When you scan an enemy, the scan reveals the weak spots of the creature, its environment, and its habits. You can also scan hieroglyphs on the wall to read Chozo Lore, you can scan parts of the environment to study plants, you can scan Space Pirate computers to learn about their evil operation, and you can scan power-ups and various stations to learn about them. At some points, scanning nearby objects gives hints on how to get by an area. There are five categories of scan-able items in your database: Creatures, Artifacts, Space Pirate information, Chozo Lore, and Research (powerups). If a scanned object fits into one of these categories, it is put into your database for later research. If you fill up a certain amount of a category, then you are rewarded with Image Galleries, which contains concept art, storyboards, and so on. The Scan Visor gives depth to an otherwise lonely game.

The X-Ray and Thermal Visors both are good for their own reasons, such as seeing invisible objects and enemies, but if you are trying to look at something right in front of you, then certain qualities may make it kind of hard to see. Also, in certain areas, wearing the thermal visor isn't such a good idea (such as in Magmoor Caverns, an underground lava-lake).
The graphics in this game are great. From the icy, frozen Sheegoth to the Flaming Magmoor, the creatures of this game are all very well done. Also, the First-Person effects are very well done, too. Go near an electric enemy and your screen becomes static-filled and hard to see through. If Samus is electrocuted or hit for a lot of damage, she puts her hand up to block the blast. Things like these remind you that the character of this game is a person, not just a thing with a gun.

Also, the sound in this game is incredible. The music gives a good sense of place. For example, the music in the Chozo Ruins is mysterious and dark, while the music for the Lava-based Magmoor Caverns is thunderous and includes chanting and such. Certain little tunes, such as the one that plays when you find a major item, will be familiar to players of Super Smash Brothers and Melee (the item tune is what plays as Samus' victory song). The creatures in the game growl, roar, or shriek, depending on what it is. The beam guns all have different sounds. If the electric wave gun kills an enemy, electricity crackles all over the enemy's body, making ""zzap-zzap"" noises for a couple seconds. The attention to detail is immense.

Samus has always been the first real heroine, but the kind where hero or heroine doesn't matter. You didn't know in the first couple games that Samus was a girl. At the end of one of the later games, Samus takes off her helmet and reveals her gender, as opposed to being a robot. Heck, in most games you wouldn't even know she was human! But in this game, you can tell she is a she. You can hear her voice when she is hit, and (this is a feature that adds a lot of realism), when she dies, she screams and the display flickers and goes out. Also, in parts like elevators, the camera shows Samus from the front, and then zooms in on her face. Yes, her face! Instead of just an opaque green faceplate, the faceplate is now transparent, so you can see her eyes, eyebrows and the outline of her head (kind of). This is a HUGE step forward in realism terms. And about her heroine-ness: She is an armored, tough girl with a gun. Her competitors (for example, Lara Croft) go around dangerous ruins in incredibly skimpy clothing. Heroine advantage: Samus, obviously. Good sense counts for a lot these days.

Overall, this game earns an eight out of ten. Metroid Prime is good, but not perfect. The scariness of some scenes makes it not a good choice for some small children. However, if you are used to that kind of thing, this is a great game.",0.010320502009762202
2882,4.0,"I had read some reviews saying you will finish this in anywhere from 8-12 hours. That is totally false. Maybe if you have played it multiple times and know where evey single thing is, you head straight through the main quest and talk to absolutely no one other than the primary task givers...then yes, you might. I am on playthrough #1 and have played it most of the day Sat and Sunday, Wed-Friday a few hours a night and am almost done. It's over 24 hours already.
- Graphics - I read that the graphics were poor. Mine are excellent. No jaggies, everything is clear and well rendered on high settings.
- Gameplay - Do all there is to do in one map before leaving. Collect all the trinkets and baubles, ammo and supplies. It will be reset to different stuff if you ever come back.
- Books contain back story and clues to safe combinations. Not like Skyrim or Oblivion where you have to read the same books a million times in different locations. The books on one map will NOT be the same as other locations.
- Trust your instincts in the game storyline. That's all I'm saying about that. Do what you think is right or wrong. You can be a cold killer or a life saver throughout the city.
- Save options. It saves before difficult areas and you can set save points. Excellent!

2884,4.0,"Graphics-
It's no surprise by looking at numerous videos and screen-captures of this game that it's a far cry from cutting edge.  The overall technical level of the graphics is either showing its age or they took a hit by having such expansive and large set pieces and characters.  That isn't to say they're awful though.  Each individual looking at this game will likely have to evaluate what they demand in terms of graphics from a game.  I personally would call them passable because while they aren't astonishing the locations of the game are interesting to look at and the enemies and characters you'll meet are appropriate to their settings and fun.  Character and attack animations while mostly understated still manage to be engaging and entertaining with spells being the most impressive of the bunch.

Sound-
The music thus far has been strictly average.  At times I feel as though I have a pack of bards tailing me because the majority of the songs I've heard having that kind of simple village music sound to them, flutes with little boisterous drive to get the blood boiling.  The voice overs aren't too bad, none of the characters are particularly irritating in cut scenes or battles but the timing does suffer from the typical Japanese to English dub syncing issues.  Overall I'd say everything works on a functional level but it does little inspire the player like a very good score sometimes can.

Combat-
Battles play out with a bit of a blend between turn based RPG standards with a touch of MMORPG.  Before battles you can set up action bars by placing acquired skills in to slots.  During a fight you will have a circular timer count up and when full you can select an action from your preselected set to use.  At the very start of the game it seems painfully slow due to few options for skills and the likelihood that you don't fully understand how the system works.  As you get more attacks, build combos, and balance your load-out to your liking though it becomes much more enjoyable.  One could for example play a mage with little to no armor wielding a dagger and they'd get turns much faster than a heavily armored melee fighter but the obvious trade off is that they become a bit of a glass cannon by trading defense for speed.  I think there's a lot of not so obvious depth to the combat which makes it rather enjoyable for me.  Granted it isn't a system everybody will enjoy and criticisms against it I feel have been fair from reading other reviews.

Enemies-
The enemies themselves seem to come in two flavors, big and small.  Small enemies are pretty much what you would expect, find what hurts them and hurt them with it.  Collect your spoils, wash, rinse, repeat.  The bigger enemies however are much more fun to fight and offer more nuanced ways of defeating them.  Early on you'll be fighting trolls for example.  Trolls have 4 targetable zones, their 2 legs, the belly, and their head.  You can defeat the enemy just by hitting it anywhere, it doesn't really matter, but you can grant you and your party opportunities by exploiting the enemy's weakness.  In the case of a troll for example you can shoot out their legs to prevent them from attacking briefly all the while granting your party an increased chance to hit by way of lowering the troll's evasion.  Another option in the single player mode is using the namesake White Knight to put the fight a little more in to proportion but still fundamentally the same.  There's a lot of variety in this sense though.  You'll encounter a limited number of archetypes for the bigger enemies but exploring these alternative and tactical ways of defeating them is both fun and rewarding as I believe attacking certain body parts can yield certain drops a la Monster Hunter (speculation).

Skills and Character Progression-
Leveling is pretty typical for the most part, kill a bunch of stuff and complete quests to accrue enough experience to advance a level.  Upon leveling up in addition to a base increase to various stats you are awarded 4 skill points.  These points can be used in several different specialties to grant abilities and stat bonuses to your character.  Each individual specialty has 50 things to buy so with 8 trees you're looking at 400 possible purchases, of which I'd say about 80% are skills the remaining 20% being stat bonuses (guestimates).  Needless to say that's a pretty adequate repertoire to choose from.  Individual characters may more or less select from any set but certain story characters are locked out of certain sets.  Your self created ""avatar"" is open to choose from them all though.  From what I've read, but I can neither confirm or deny at this juncture, is that your created character is also given a chance for a re-specialization (or respec as we nerds call it) at level 50 and following the completion of the story mode.  This respec supposedly bumps you back to level 35, refunds all of your skill points, and rewards you with 40 additional bonus points.  This can be done upwards of 4 times.  All things considered it's a very flexible system with a lot of possible appeal to min/maxers by having the ability to dip in to multiple trees.  By about level 22 I had ""maxed"" a single set so those simply going through story mode I imagine will be looking at going fully in to 2 trees or maybe touching base in 2-4.

Combos-
I just wanted to briefly address the combo system.  After gaining some skills you can freely make your own combos using those skills.  The advantage to a combo is that it allows you to unload several powerful attacks given a single turn counter but they also are costly in terms of battle resources.  In battle you have typical MP which various abilities use, not just magic, and then you also have ""Action Chips"" which for lack of a better way of putting it is effectively a super bar.  So a combo will typically have a pretty steep MP/AC cost but again this is pretty flexible depending on how many and which skills you build the combo with.  Having a good spammable combo is just as viable as having a devastating nuke.

The White Knight-
The White Knight is a mechanic of the story and doesn't exist in the online mode.  The main character may transform in to the White Knight at will (space permitting) and may stay in the form for as long as he has MP.  Each attack the Knight uses depletes Leonard's MP and once drained he reverts to his normal form.  Your other party members are allowed to fight alongside the White Knight and as you progress through the game, and Leonard develops, you will acquire equipment for the Knight which boosts the combat abilities of your party members in the presence of the Knight.  The Knight also gets a baseline increase in fighting power as Leonard progresses ranging from skills to stats.

Story-
Save the princess, save the kingdom, save the world.  Nothing to write home about but it's a serviceable and time honored plot.  It won't be moving any story junkies in any particular way but it is peppered with its charming, humorous, and exciting moments.

Online-
Here we go, this in my opinion is the meat and potatoes of the game and it's single most redeeming factor.  The format is simple, select a quest, recruit some other players, and head out.  This is all organized in common areas called hometowns.  Initially there is only the one generic town which anybody can access but individual players have the ability to create their own town via the game's Georama system.  The town isn't just a place to plop building and look pretty though.  Depending on which buildings you have and who you put in them can alter various factors of your town such as shop inventories.  Upgrading your Georama hometown is a constant endeavor.  Each individual set piece needs to be crafted which requires having various collected materials from the environment and the world's denizens as well as often large sums of cash.  The residents of your home are also drawn from the single-player world where NPCs with green speech bubbles can be openly recruited.  You're only allowed to have so many NPCs in your roster at a given time so you'll often have to revisit your recruitment efforts to select people of specific professions or finding more able individuals to replace poor performers as your town advances (most recruits have requirements to recruit and aren't immediately available).  There's a lot of subtlety to the system though.  Each NPC has a job and having multiple NPCs with the same job, and furthermore selecting a leader amongst them, grants bonuses to their respective categories (farmers, warriors, mages...) when placed in the same building.  On the flip side penalties can also be issued by mixing your NPCs.

So you've got your town and you've got your quests, now what?  As you enter in to a quest you will be met with a staging area where people can prep and meet before the quest starts.  Once all the players are organized the leader may manually start the quest or a pre-determined time limit will automatically initiate the quest.  There isn't necessarily anything fundamentally exciting about the online missions but the difficult is ramped up considerably and the rewards are typically quite good for completing them.  Completing a mission in a timely fashion with varying level of completion also grants a rank for the particular mission and a corresponding scaling in the reward.  Being able to coordinate as a team keeps the battles exciting and rewarding and really ties together the various skill sets.  Magic for example does heaps more damage than bow skills but the bow skill set features many abilities to open up weaknesses for the rest of your party.  All things considered it's very fun and does away with what is sometimes a mundane single player experience to get down to the nuts and bolts of what makes the game enjoyable.

The online and offline mode are more or less tied together though.  You must advance through the single player to be granted more access to new areas and online quests so unfortunately those completely appalled by the single player would have to soldier through it to fully access the online mode.  On that same note, those who don't care for the solo-player may find it easier to swallow by doing a little here and there as you push your online efforts forward.

And that is basically that.  In conclusion I've found that most of the complaints I've read about the game to be fair, or at the very least not wildly off base, but on that same note the bulk majority of them address only the single player campaign.  From this we can gather that this game offers much more value to those willing and able to access the online mode.  That isn't to say that the single player is a chore, it simply isn't overly impressive in any particular way and it's even harder to get excited about coming off of Mass Effect 2 and leading in to Final Fantasy 13 and several other RPGs.  If sold by itself with no online mode I could only recommend this game in good faith at a bargain price or a rental.

Breath of Fire by Capcom for the Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Micro and Nintendo DS. This is yet another port from the SNES to the GBA system. Breath of fire is one of the lesser-known RPG's that turned out to be really good.

You start out as a young teen and your town is under attack from the DARK dragons.

Your older sister sacrifices herself to save you and the town. Thus starts your quest for revenge. You meet up with a Princess, a Thief, a Bad Merchant, a Wolfen-Hunter, a Mole person, the Brute Ox, and a Sorceress. All of them have talents you will need to get your revenge. Be prepared for a 20 hour-long quest.

Graphics 7/10 - For a GBA based game the graphics are good. There are some movie-like full motion videos.

Music 5/10 - Same as the SNES version, Capcom could have updated it.

Gameplay 9/10 - Fun and addictive, some of the mini-games like fishing, digging, and hunting were lots of fun.

Battle System 6/10 - The same turn based system we all know and love, with the addition of being able to turn into a dragon and morph into a mix of the people on your team. The magic system is earned in levels and by finding the spells.

Overall 7/10 - The game was fun and kept me entertained until the very end.

My only complaint is that they could have updated the story and the music a bit. Burn Baby Burn!",-0.029730718198210458
2900,4.0,"When i first started playing this game i felt like i had been burned by a HOMM rip-off.  I was upset that i couldn't upgrade any castles or i couldn't tell which creature's turn it was during the battle scenes.  But once i started getting in to the game, it started to grow on me, i just had to accept it for what it was.  I mean i still think it is a HOMM rip-off to some extent, many of the units look the same and even have the same abilities, for instance, the vampires have the ""no enemy retaliation"" ability which is exactly like Heroes.  I thought not being able to upgrade my castle sucked at first but then i realized it gave me more time to focus on my hero and just do some good old fashion text-based questing.  They don't skimp on the text in this game either, be prepared to read some fairly lengthy stories and requests from all the locals.

The graphics are very pleasing to the eye, very bright and vibrant!  There is a nice variation of terrain too, ranging from marshy swamps to lush forests to snowy peaks.  You choose to play as a Warrior, Paladin or Mage each with their strengths and weaknesses.  Its a turn-based game where you are tasked with building armies and casting spells to defeat the enemy on a grid based battlefield.  If you have played Heroes of Might and Magic 5 then you will be very familiar with this games layout.  The only aspect of King's Bounty that is original to the game is the addition of the Spirits of Rage Box that you find early in the game.  It contains four powerful spirits which level up with use.  They are like the secret weapon of King's Bounty and can deal out some serious damage in time.

There are so many quests and different areas to explore, its hard to say how long it would take to complete everything.  I think what makes this game fun and addicting is it constantly rewards you with gold and items with every step and every battle, so you always feel like you are advancing quickly.  I like to think of this game as a homage to the HOMM series and not a rip-off.  Regardless, it is a solid game and for the price its hard to go wrong with all the hours of entertainment it provides.",0.027009686541868985

2906,4.0,"WWF Raw has a fantastic wrestling engine which goes a long way towards making this game enjoyable. It looks and feels like you're in control of a WWF match from beginning to end and this is what wrestling games are supposed to give us. I was a huge fan of No Mercy and Wrestlemania 2000 on N64 and this feels like a huge next generation leap forward from those games in terms of gameplay. I'm not sure how Wrestlemania X8 is going to turn out on GameCube, but I know long time Nintendo/wrestling fans would definitely want something like Raw.
The lack of a true career mode hurts this game the same way it hurts sports games that merely pay lip service to this feature. I had lofty expectations for the first Xbox wrestling game and I wanted to see complicated, interactive, choose-your-own adventure type story modes. Even though I was being very unrealistic, it's still disappointing that Raw, with this Title Match Mode, does not even attempt any sort of true career/story mode.
With that said, Raw does a whole lot more good than bad, and it's still a game that Xbox owners need to pick up if they have even the slightest interest in the WWF. I'm not sure if there's such a thing as casual WWF/Xbox fan but Raw will appeal to them as well with its outstanding WWF realism.

- amazing story line that leaves you hanging
- Graphics are pretty decent
- you are able to create different parties (friends to accompany you on your particular adventure)
- the sense of an actual living network is very strong
- free range the game allows an amazing amount of freedom..you can explore hundreds of different areas..optionally. Even after you complete the game!
- Mini games, like raising grunties (pig like creatures you can ride)
- the game comes with a 45 min. DVD, which like the game has a strong storyline.
The Bad
- The game is pretty short..though you can still play, the storyline just doesn't advance.
-repeating graphics..the dungeons have different catagories.. ice castle, normal castle, cave, and insides (human, dog or snail) In the beginning they are all very exciting, but towards the end a little tiring.

2912,4.0,"First, I must say that I am a HUGE fan of the Tiger Woods games. I have always enjoyed each years release and have never been disappointed with any version save for the number of courses included (more on that later).

-The new dynamic ability system is fantastic. I have good days and bad days on the course in real life and it does impact my overall ability so it is nice to see this included in the game. Some people will hate this though as it does punish you if you have a really bad round and forces you to place importance on EVERY shot regardless of whether you are in the hunt or not.

-Graphics- there is definitely a noticeable improvement in the graphics. The course textures are more detailed and varied and the lighting has been improved 10 fold which gives the whole course a real nice look and casts some really gorgeous shadows from the trees. The water is insanely beautiful. The only downside is the trees. While they are much improved over last years version there are times when some of them are downright ugly. What makes them look worse is that the rest of the course is so beautifully rendered.

-The sound effects are great as always with a plethora of diverse environmental sounds on every hole. The cheers from the crowd sound good as well. As stated in another review on Amazon, it would have been nice to be able to turn off the crowd and just listen to the course sounds so it feels more authentic to when you go out in real life. The commentary is awful as always so I just turn it off.

-Club tuning is now a feature in Tiger Woods and I like it quite a bit. It feels very authentic going to the range and tweaking how your clubs work and it definitely has an impact on the game, at least it does for me.

-Courses - I believe there are 16 in this year's game which is the same number as last year. There are some great new additions like Wolf Creek and the Gary Player Country Club but there should have been at LEAST another 4 courses included. I am certain that EA will dress up some of the older courses from years past and sell them to us for 400 ms points which is just plain wrong. How about this EA? For each brand new course you want to sell to us on the marketplace include one of the older courses for free. 2 courses for 400 points sounds perfect to me.

There is also an option to actually PURCHASE items in the pro shop with ms points. A clever idea but the prices are so high that it is just not worth it because you can still just earn in game money and purchase them. I tested it out and they wanted 200 ms points for a polo shirt that provided NO bonus skill at all. Insane. They should have made these items 20-30 ms points each at most.

So there you have it, a quick rundown of my opinions on Tiger Woods 09. I am sure there is more I should have said but I want to go play now :)

Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone that remotely likes video game golf. I am VERY happy with my purchase!!

The game offers difficulty settings so there is replay value for younger audiences and out-of-the-box challenge for more veteran players. Also, hidden collectibles are available allowing the player to go back and find all the items to develop gadgets. This is more than a simple beat-em-up game; the enemies have abilities that complement each other, thus attacks have to be thought out or you will be left open for attack. Also, Knack's size will change approaches to enemies, bringing both balance and strategy to the gameplay.

2921,4.0,"Final Fantasy XII is a fun and intresting spin on the Final Fantasy series because of it's innovative style to the series.  What makes each game intresting that by each installment, Squaresoft-Enix ups the bar by improving on the game system which includes innovating battle sequences, experience points, etc etc.  FFXII does this a number ways for instance introducing a real-time battle system that also echoes a turn-based battle system.  What some RPG games lack when they are real-time is you use one primary character through the battles.  However, in FFXII, you are for the most time, forced to use every single character.  Another example is the new Liscence Board which somewhat achoes the Sphere Grid in FFX but adds a new element to the way you mold your characters.

My only dissapointment with the game is the characters themselves, while the storyline is absolutly excellent, do not seem to connect with eachother and as well as the gamer.  You have Van=Pinelo, Ashe=Basche, and Balthier=Fran and, despite some sequences, they naturally stick in these cliques.  However, the storyline is engrossing to the point of bewilderment.

Overall, this is a entirely new Final Fantasy game which deserves to be recognized as one of the top Final Fantasy installments.  It's innovative uniqueness to the FF franchise helps it stands out.

2922,4.0,"NOTE: You will not get surround sound with these headphones on the Xbox One.  This is not the fault of the headphones, but rather with the Xbox One console.

The Turtle Beach Titanfall headset is very comfortable and should feel great for long gaming sessions.  The padding on top of the headset will make it more comfortable, but it could have used better padding all around.  The microphone is removable, so you can use it just as a headset if you are not going to chat.  I like this feature quite a bit, but it could be a problem for kids, as they are prone to losing things.

This headset has additional connection cables for the Xbox 360, so it is a multi-system, multi-function device that will work with both consoles, and with mobile devices.

The sound quality is really good and doesnt seem terribly bass heavy in presentation, so you can hear everything that is going on around you.  A great feature of these headphones is the ability to use them as regular headphones, as you can plug the standard mini plug into your iPod, phone, tablet, etc. and use them.  This is great, as it makes them a multi-purpose purchase instead of something that is simply for gaming.  The sound is certainly not as good as Grado or Sony MDR-7506 for music, but they are not bad at all and should be great for most people, especially those who will use them for multiple purposes.  The headset is capable of producing a very loud volume, so please be careful and protect your hearing.

The headset comes with the adapter necessary to use the headphones with the new XBOX One controller, but you must update your controller before they will work.  This is a simple process that can be done in a couple of minutes:

Connect your controller to your Xbox One console with a USB cable.
Open the Settings application.
Select System.
Select Update Controller.

The controller will be updated after this process is completed, but I was prompted for another update when the headset was actually plugged into the controller.  Be sure to do both, as I don't know what will happen if you cancel the second one.

2927,4.0,"Yes, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 looks VERY different from the first and second versions of the game.  Others have addressed some of these major differences and I echo these sentiments.

What I will add:  If you are sensitive or suffer from motion sickness, be careful when  ""riding"" a ride. I literally became quite ill with a migraine!  I will say, however, my children LOVED this aspect of the game and can easily spend hours doing so.

The peeps can be a little disappointing.  They wander around and get lost easily unless you have very SIMPLE paths.  I also agree that sandbox is the way to go.

But this game is about building rides and the ability to do so in this is a fantastic feature.  I think it is a little more challenging and not being able to make tunnels is a little disappointing but making some out of this world roller coasters will make it worth everything for some people.

2928,4.0,"I should start out with saying that this game is not a traditional game from Squaresoft, it is like a jazzed up version of Streets of Rage or something.  It has many good things about it, and many bad things.
First off, graphics are amazing, and dialog sounds different instead of having that robotic sound to it.  By all means this is a great game, it's got story, it's pretty fun, and it has the hugest replay value of any game ever.
However, the game is extremely short, about an hour or two, depending if you skip movies or not.  And after beating the game a few times, the only fun thing to do is battle it out with a few of your freinds.  I would like to have seen more RPG elements in this game, instead of movies then fighting.
If you want to showoff your playstation 2, or you have some freinds to fight with, then this game is for you.  However, if you are more of an RPG-er and not much for just battle games, then just rent the game first.",0.031034858387799562
2929,4.0,"As I review this game, I'm beginning to wonder how many people have even heard of this game and or how many people actually cared about what they'd like to call ""another movie tie in game"".
But being a gamer, I decided to give this game a chance based off the limited screenshots and 40 seconds of Youtube gameplay videos I actually saw for this game. It's amazing how unknown this game truly is. Onto the review-

First thing's first, I cannot stress enough how bad the voice acting is in this game. It is absolutely terrible and rarely am I actually annoyed with voice acting in gaming, but this game really grated my nerves at times.
Voice acting lacks enthusiasm, is obviously (and I do mean obviously) rushed; and one character sounds as if he's partially slurring, mumbling and not really giving a crap about the voice acting whatsoever.
Often, I found that while playing this game, the characters talk way too fast and are hard to understand being that they speak at the most awkward times. (during battles, escapes or while the music is overpowering audio)

Secondly, the in-game cut scenes aren't able to be skipped whatsoever. This can be quite annoying considering it's a mix of actual movie scenes and in-game cutscenes. The movie scenes are really crappy looking, resembling blurry dvd (or VCD) quality. Further, the cutscenes give you no reason to care about the game's story whatsoever.
Thankfully, while the game's story is rather terrible, the gameplay is it's saving grace and this would be the reason to buy this game altogether.

The graphics are good. Perhaps some of the better graphics you'll see on the PS2, but pales in comparison to it's 6th gen counterparts' offerings. (I.E Gamecube/Xbox)
The characters themselves are very detailed and this game features some impressive ""fur effects"" that are applied to the character's hair or pollen. It looks quite impressive. The backgrounds are also very impressive and littered with detail. The framerate can be a little quirky at times, but the occasion it does happen is extremely limited. One of the things that impressed me the most was using the camera to zoom in any 3 character you choose and being able to see the intricate details without any graphical glitches to speak of. In fact, the characters look better big than small.
With that said, Arthur and the invisibles does feature it's graphical problems which have been a problem for PS2 games; period. The problem would be ""jaggies"" or some flatness with low res textures. But overall, the graphics are done quite well and really take advantage of what PS2 has to offer. Unfortunately, it's not progressive scan compatible, but this may be a blessing being that progressive scan will increase jaggies.

Now onto the meat of the review with Gameplay-

You take control of Arthur, a kid that has been shrunken to an insect sized ""treasure troll look alike"".
Arthur and the invisibles is strikingly similar to most platformers you've played, except this one requires some puzzling and is just a wonderful experience altogether. You choose from 3 characters, Arthur being one of them, a girl with a sword and a smaller boy character that flings knives. Each character gets upgrades based on their attributes. Arthur gets better acrobatic abilities, the boy gets better and more powerful knife attacks and the girl gets sword upgrades.

Because each character is so tiny, they're only able to fight against something their size, and while the game features plenty of combat and innovative ways to destroy enemies, it also feature combat with puzzles such as blinding a mosquito with a ball of pollen so you're able to slip past it or activating switches etc.
Unfortunately, the story wasn't my cup of tea and I'd of preferred this game much more if it featured better voice acting and in-game cutscenes.

With that said, I highly recommend getting this game. It is a PS2 exclusive. It takes advantage of PS2's hardware and delivers graphics, and it is very underrated and almost unheard of. The voice acting may be annoying and the story leaves much to be desired, but this isn't your average run of the mill movie tie in games.",0.01822644479852718

2932,4.0,"I BEAT THE GAME.so this will be my final copy.
  initialy,i didn't know what noire meant.someone described it to me as a old 30s and 40s detective movies where the lines between good and bad are hard to see.in gta 4,niko bellic could make moral decisions that affected the outcome of the story.that would have been cool in this game.that way you could be a good cop or bad cop.
  there was very little of that cool talking associated with this type of story.stuff like.i was walking through the soul of this rancid city being crushed by morphine hells in the insanity vice oozing out of the mirrors of  a junkies eyes....more of that would have been cool
  ive been to a shoe store called nunbush.hehehe.
i was driving around and thought""wow! everyone here is driving such cool cars!"".then i remembered this story takes place in the 40's.all those cars are classics now.maybe even antiques.
  it was a while ago.here are some funny things ,chronologicaly speaking.a $30 suit,calling tiffanys jewelry junk,asking how anybody could make $20,000,A $200 coat,saving up a nest egg of $11,000,a $2000 car,a $20,000 house,a salary of $120 a month.there was also a social security sign up ad on the radio.another time there was a hotel where law breakers hide out.they game false names in the book like winston churchill and orsen welles.

  there are some breasts in this one and the other feminine part.but don't get your hopes up.they're attatched to naked ,dead chicks.eeewwwwww! there is a nude master piece on the bad bosses wall.i think it may be a michelangelo.
  i bought this game for 2 reasons.one was because it had the rockstar logo on it.that means quality game.however,the amount of content is not very rockstar at all.ive been playing for 6 days and now im already done.does rockstar still = quality or is it all team bondi's fault?i read that there were 186,000 pictures gone over to make this game look just like 1940's los angeles.where was this ambition during gameplay and story lines?
  2-because i figured i could beat the crap out of bad guys in the interrogation room.but no! im in a ways and i haven't got to use the phone book on one low life yet.yet my partner gets to.and my guy always stops him.it must just be part of the story.in interrogations,there are 3 choices you have which are truth,doubt and lie.they should have included beat,intimidate and torture.now that would have been cool.you could leave him hungry or not let them pee or turn the tempurature way up and leave him there.however,much later there is a big escalation in violence.but its well into the game.the shootouts save 1 had a body count under 10.a newer guy is far more viscious than the first guy.now im getting to like this one better.the character keeps switching but they both are getting angrier.
  ive only owned this game since it came out[may 17th 2011],but have played a lot.right now it is my 22nd game of all time.the best part about the game was the ww2 flashbacks the main character has.you want an idea for a good idea for a game?kick team bondi to the curb.then make a marines game based on ww2.just leave out all of the dead civilians.
  people have been asking are sequels ruining the gaming industry?here are the games coming out this year im exited about child of eden,star wars kinects,fable 3,,assassins creed brotherhood,arkham city,dragon age 2,max payne 3,la noire,mass effect 3[which got moved to 2012 though],elder scrolls 5 and lego clone wars. 8 are sequels! sequels aren't ruining gaming,they are running it! la noire is no exeption.
  i was sickened by the graphic depiction of burned up children at one of the arson cases.also,there is a clip of some soldiers executing burning ,hospitalized children and japanese civilians.the ww2 flashbacks WERE pretty cool until that.this is the entertainment industry and that is anything but entertaining.
  some of the story is buggy.where like things happen that weren't shown that affect the main story.
  the area where the final battle goes down is silly.
  i have beaten the game now.there were 3 discs but it took only 6 days.there is a free roam side game where you can just drive around fighting crimes.they usualy end up in shoot outs.i like it better than the actual game.
  i knew whodunnit  was very early on.maybe it was written like that or maybe im just that good.
  i say go ahead and buy it just don't expect rockstar quality stuff because they worked in conjunction with team bondi who let us all down.",0.009084349366758344
2933,4.0,"Concept:  9/10
Call of Duty World at War takes place in World War II.  The setting is NOT the `oh too familiar' Normandy Beach Invasion.  Instead this game focuses on the island warfare between the US and Japan and the Russians counterattacking the Germans near the end of the war.  There's a 6-10 hour campaign, Co-op Modes, Multiplayer, and a fun mini-game called Nazi Zombies.

Story:  8/10
Although the cutscenes are fairly poor, the game's story is interesting because it focuses on some of the lesser known, but epic battles of World War II.  All of this content feels new, even though World War II has been featured in countless games.  You play as a US Marine battling through the Pacific Jungles and a Russian Soldier storming Berlin.

Graphics:  8/10
The graphics are good, but not as good as the Modern Warfare games and newer releases like Black Ops, but they still do a good job at convincing your brain that you are in intense firefights!

Gameplay:  8/10
The gameplay mechanics of the Call of Duty series are great.  This series added the ""Grenade HUD Indicator"" warning you if you are about to get blown to bits and the ""Left Trigger Target Lock"" function making aiming much easier.  Shooters that came out before this series were incredibly difficult and players had to side strafe while trying to line up the cursor on the enemies' heads to get head shots.  Now you just aim, Hold the Left Trigger, move up a bit and fire.  It's much easier to feel like a hero this way!
The Call of Duty series features intense battles, but fairly generous checkpoints.  There are four difficulty levels:
Recruit - This is as easy as the game can get without taking away the danger.
Regular - This offers some challenge and it's still fairly exciting, but experienced gamers can run right through the missions.
Hardened - This gives experienced fans of shooters a challenge, but the constant bombardment of grenades by enemy troops can get frustrating.  At some points, I was literally hit with 6 grenades at once while trapped in a trench.
Veteran - Be prepared to battle for every inch of the map, but if you are an X-Box Achievement Junkie, you get a good amount for finishing each and every level.

Missions:  8/10
As with all Call of Duty Games, the Missions are a mixed bag.  Some are incredibly amazing, while others are just ok.  The missions take place in the Pacific Jungles and German Ruins.  There's sniping, demolition, tank warfare, firefights, and a mission where you play the gunner on a sea plane sinking Japanese Cargo Ships and shooting down Japanese Zeroes.

Co-op:  6/10
You can play through the Campaign with friends / split screen or through Xbox Live.  But unlike the campaign, your allies can die, which makes the mission a whole lot tougher.  The lack of a Save Feature hurts this mode.

Multiplayer:  6/10
The CoD series features some good multiplayer maps, upgradeable weapons and skills, and the Perks System for rewarding Kill Streaks.  If you kill a few guys, you can call in additional AI Firepower.  There are team games and free for all games.  If you're already addicted to the multiplayer of Black Ops or Modern Warfare, there's no reason to play this, unless you really love WWII.

Nazi Zombies:  7/10
This is a fun mini-game, also featured in Call of Duty Black Ops, where you are trapped in a boarded up house and hordes of zombies are attacking you.  By shooting them and repairing barricades, you earn points.  You use those points to buy better weapons and ""unlock"" other rooms to expand the level.  If you play with friends, it's pretty fun like Left 4 Dead.  If you play alone, it's just ok.  An updated version of this game is also available in Call of Duty Black Ops.

Sound:  10/10
The sound is amazing.  Explosions, bullets, heroic music bring the action to live.  It also doesn't hurt that your main ally is voiced by 24's Jack Bauer.  How can you not like fighting for America along side Keifer Sutherland?!  If Jack Bauer tells you that you can take the hill, you believe that you can take the hill!

Maturity M
Intense battles, graphic violence, gore, swearing, real footage from WWII...  This is not a kids' game.

Overall:  8/10
This game has been out for two years, but at the Platinum Price, it is still a good purchase.  It features Intense Combat, CoD's Good Gameplay, Co-op, Multiplayer, and Nazi Zombies!  It's not my favorite game of the Call of Duty series, but if you like the gameplay and want to experience a different side of WWII, you will enjoy this.

Buy it if you are interested in the Pacific Battles of WWII or if you like WWII games in general.
Buy it if you love the Call of Duty Series and want to experience another exciting campaign, Multiplayer, Co-op, Nazi Zombies...

Rent it if just want to blow through the Campaign.  It should take about 6-12 hours depending on the difficulty setting that you choose.

Avoid it if you don't like intense violence, loud noises, or harsh language.

If you liked this game, pick up Call of Duty Black Ops!

2940,4.0,"Conventionally, I wouldn't have bought this game. But I like getting a new game every once in a while, and the recent string of games haven't been up to snuff. So I took a risk, and I was surprised.
THQ also makes those wrestling games, which I played a little while back and decided weren't my thing, which was no surprise because wrestling in that sense wasn't my thing either. I was dubious now that they had delved into the world of real fighting.
The controls are like Skate. They say they're intuitive, they aren't, but once you get the hang of them, the learning curve is huge, and they make enough sense. I've gone back to the tutorial not once, not twice, but three times, because every time I learn some more about the game and feel the need to brush up on the finer points.
Options are limited. This isn't some shooter type game where you can alter every last detail. You pick the number of rounds, the arena, and if you really want, which referee you have. And you only have three to choose from. The depth of this game lies in the gameplay.
I personally feel that the game is progressing as I am, and that every time I learn something new the fighters in career mode are just that little bit harder. I rarely play a game with such remarkable pace and challenge from beginning to end. Nothing is ever impossible; nothing is ever simple either.
Certain elements of the career mode, like just basic training, are annoying and time wasting. Other elements, like the camps, are actually useful. While playing, I consciously think ""man, I need to work on my ground game"", or something similar, which is a feat, because the game is actually making me think like a fighter.
Is this game perfect? No. And I won't make some statement about it coming damn close.

  3.  The inventory system is easy to use.  Figuring out which action to take at any particular time is more of a challenge.  Nice 3D graphics and music.  Mostly good voice acting.
Cons:
  1.  The keyboard control system is unusually sensitive.  You can use the mouse to pan around outdoor locations, but indoors you use only the keyboard.  There are plenty of obstacles on the street that bounce you back from your intended path.
  2.  Although the cutscenes are fun to watch, you may have to watch some of them over and over.  If you hate repetition, this is not the game for you.  There is no fighting in the game, but you do see the hero die again and again, which makes the game too intense for young children.
  3.  The game (played on Windows XP) crashed occasionally.  Also, I would have liked about twenty more save-game slots.

Some of the guys in 4 are awesome too, such as Pharoah Man and Toad Man, but they don't compare to the guys in 1, 2 and Part 3.

Needless to say, this is definitely one of the better licensed games on older consoles. The aesthetic is spot on for Tron, the gameplay still holds up well enough in 2014, and the game looks surprisingly nice via component > HDMI on the original Xbox.",0.02654625068418172

However, its not for the weak of heart.  manhunt is a greusome game with strong profanity and a disturbing story.  When you start the game and realize that you can saw a guys head off with a thin wire, you know its gotta be bad.  There are endless ways to kill people, and each death becomes more graphic as you progress.  Nearing the end your decapitating people with chainsaws...right after you eviscerate them.

I have both machines and i have 20 ps3 exclusives that look great and about 6 fps exclusives on the 360. other than that there really aren't any stand out games here.......now let's talk about the 360. It does have a better online store and interface. Better online community. better system performance. Now mind you i have the old ps3 fat and it freezes atlease every other day. with the 360 slim i never had a freeze. I think you will find more cheaper games for the 360 so that's another plus. so there you have it it's a great machine and have all the latest and greatest games, if you want a console that will get that support from their creator than this is the one you want while Sony kinda does their support at a slow paste, especially when it comes to anything online related(dlc,issues with games)",0.07436207393834512

Now with the game itself.  It is a very fun, essentially multiplayer only game.  It has a lot of similarities to Call of Duty multi-player, so if you're into that sort of thing, this game is for you and is probably worth every penny.  If you typically get bored of Call of Duty style MP, then I would not recommend this at full price.

Titanfall was hyped up to be revolutionary, but it's more evolutionary in terms of MP.  In terms of the overall game, to sum it up, I would call it a fun MP game that lacks value and substance.",0.03347701149425287

Lots of fun, especially if you have two guitar controllers and can play either competitively or cooperatively.

2968,4.0,"I bought this game for the fun of it. It is not what I originally expected, however I am not disappointed. The game uses the camera to have you search your surrounding area for ""ghosts"", which look like they are from the Alien series. Once you clear the area of ghosts, it is quite hard to find another ghost all together. In fact, the first ghost I found was in my dinning room and after days of combing through my house searching for more ghosts and turning up nothing, on a whim I brought my DS to my grandmother's house. As soon as I opened the game, I was swarmed with ghosts. That was last night, and I have not found any more ghosts in either her house or my house. In this respect, it will be a very slow moving game. Be careful of your surroundings as you play, since you will have to walk around and scan your area for these ghosts. This game requires way more patience than it does skill, but nonetheless it is enjoyable.",0.0271256038647343
2969,4.0,"I purchased this primarily for the blu-ray player.  For me the game functionality was secondary.  That being said, there are a couple of shortfalls with this system.

First of all there are no IR inputs, so my Logitech Harmony won't work with blu-ray or standard DVD playback.  That is a huge shortcoming for me since 80% of the use of this system will be with movies rather than games.  The only way I can have this system work with my Harmony remote is if I purchase a $30 third party remote.  Since a small factor in my decision to finally purchase this system is that things like wireless connectivity and online play are standard, this is a disappointment.  Anyone who is a 360 owner can tell you how old it gets being nickel and dimed by Microsoft for everything that isn't included in the standard system.

Second of all, what is with the huge load times?  I purchased Gran Turismo 5 with the system and before I could even start playing a game I had to load an update to the system itself and then an update to the game.  I'm aware of the fact that the 360 sometimes requires updates, but they hardly seem as long as the ones I had to endure before I could play GT5:P.

Third, why doesn't this come standard with the dual shock controller?  There shouldn't be a need to elaborate on that point.

Overall this system is great and performs as expected, but there are a couple shortfalls that the fanboys fail to mention while they're talking up Sony.",0.009670592565329409
2970,4.0,"While I praise Devil May Cry, its sequel, while still a good game, has some issues.  First off, kick ass Dante who I so praise in my above review is seemingly gone.  His character says all of five sentences during the entire course of the game, and bases all his decisions on the flip of a coin.  Didn't Two-Face from Batman do that?  Anyway there's a second disc with another playable character, the oddly shapen Lucia.  Lucis has her own story, her own moves, and her own weapons.  The problem here is, we really don't care because we don't understand her story.  In the original DMC, we understood what Dante was searching for, the purpose of his quest, and we enjoyed everything he encountered along the way.  In DMC2, we don't understand why Dante is even on this mission, or why he is interacting with Lucia.  Did the creators suddenly forget about Trish from the original?  I think it would have made more sense to place her in Lucia's role.  All in all, it is unfair to compare DMC2 to it's predecessor, but that is what nearly every reviewer will do.  It is still a fun game, with new monsters, new weapons and new moves, but it is a far cry from the original.",-0.008334742180896026
2971,4.0,"By now, the Final Fight franchise has started to age as a new generation of side scrolling games have come and taken everyone's attention away. The first Final Fight was a decent attempt at an arcade port and the second one was greeted by mixed reactions/criticisms from players. Capcom then released Final Fight 3 in 1995 and while it's not without its flaws, it is the best Final Fight game for the SNES.

Final Fight 3 brings back Haggar and Guy from the previous games and joins then with two new characters (Lucia and Dean) as they take on a new gang that was inspired by the Mad Gear Gang (old enemies) to wreck havoc in Metro City. You can choose to change the settings in the options screen, pick from one of four characters and battle enemies & boss characters through 9 stages that branch off in different directions. Each character has his/her own special and super moves. Super moves are executed by pulling off Street Fighter inspired arrow/button combinations that deal a lot of damage. You can have a friend jump in at any time since it has 2 player support. If you don't have anyone to come join you, the game has a 2 player computer option where the A.I. controls the second character and fights alongside your character.

The PROS: Taking advantage of a 24 Megabit cartridge, it's the biggest Final Fight game out of the three and it shows. The graphics and overall presentation are good to look at. The music is pretty standard at this point but still get you in the mood to fight the bad guys while the sound effects are fine (although a little muffled.) The controls work great and 2 player support means you'll have more fun playing with a friend. Having the stages branch off in different directions means you'll have to play this a few times until you see everything and that's a good thing. The characters each have their own feel and it's interesting to see that Capcom didn't bring back any of the new characters from Final Fight 2.

The CONS: If you don't like Final Fight, then this game won't change your mind. This game was made for the fans and for the most part, they succeeded. Despite the new changes in gameplay this game brings, it still gets a little repetitive from time to time. Also, why didn't they bring back Cody? He seems to be missing in action this time. And once you beat the game, that's it.

Final Fight 3 closes the trilogy on the SNES and didn't set the world on fire back then. Fans of the series will get the mot joy out of this game as it goes out of the way to keep the action fresh and fun. It's a good attempt in keeping the Final Fight franchise alive and worth playing. It's better than Final Fight 2 so for those of you who didn't bother playing part 3 the first time around, you should reconsider and go for it.",0.03959607945296742

2981,4.0,"Need more proof that Nintendo GameCube is indeed a powerful console? If you still think that XBox is the end all tell of video games, shame on you. Once more Capcom has put out a game of amazing beauty for the GameCube, once more they have given us a game containing better graphics than anything on XBox, and once more they manage to scare us half to death, and make us have a blast at the same time.
 This game is not without faults, however. I play this game on a 27"" GE TV. I guess because of the large screen (there are larger) I can see a lot more of the flaws that SOME, but not all of the game's cut scenes contain. Over all this game looks better than the RE-make released earlier this year, but there are some scenes that contain a jarring amount of aliasing (jaggies), which I firmly believe, could have been smoothed out better. On the other side of the coin there is not one hick up in the flow of the cinemas, where as the RE Make had occasional skipping in some parts of the game. I believe that neither flaw needs to exist, but neither the occasional jaggies, nor vinyl looking FMV sequences detract much from the enjoyability of RE 0 which is still a fantastic game.
 The control is still an issue. While I agree that the control style is clunky, I am so used to it these days that it doesn't matter to me. I'll take this control style over the mouse & keyboard dual analogue control style that has been rearing its ugly head a lot of late. I also enjoyed the character swapping; it was smooth, with no additional loading like I feared it would need. It ads a lot to the game play.
 I think that the ability to drop items anywhere is a double edge sword. On one hand its nice to be able to do that for an emergency when you need a really big gun and can't grab it because you have two herbs that are wasting space, or a brief case, or whatever... but I miss the item boxes where I could dump everything and be able to magically get it from another box further in the game. Having both would have been nice.
 Over all RE 0 is a worthy addition to the Resident Evil Saga, and a welcome one at that. I still wish that they would completely remake RE 2, 3 and Code Veronica while they're at it. So far these GameCube Resident Evils have been phenomenal... I am eager to get my hands on part 4.",0.0024973359989368697

At the end of the day, you'll like this game if you liked Fallout 3, Oblivion, and the like. It's nowhere near as awesome as Demon's Souls (a common comparison, so I thought I'd weigh in). My primary complaint is that by now we should see more innovation in a game based almost entirely on a great story and character interactions than a limited selection of text-based dialogue and stodgy choices with few consequences to the decisions being made.

2991,4.0,"In the year 2011, Skyrim was the positively received by users of the Playstation 3; Batman: Arkham City was the most popular game for the Xbox 360. But for the Nintendo Wii, the most popular game released was The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword.

For owners of the Nintendo Wii, last year was a bit of a bumpy ride. Rather than focus on their home console, Nintendo paid more attention to their new handheld console: the Nintendo 3DS. With the Wii's recent downfall in the amount of new games being created for it and the announcement of the Nintendo Wii U, things were looking down for the Nintendo Wii. However, with the arrival of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, Nintendo makes their final attempt at keeping the Wii alive.

This large, ever-expanding Wii game packs in so much into one little disc. Because I'm personally not one to jump directly into a game, I found it slightly annoying how large the game really was--as I'm not one to play video games for hours on end.

While Skyward Sword can take hours to fully complete, all the many multiple features this game includes calls for a great replay value. I say this because you'll most likely find yourself replaying it over and over again to find hidden treasures you hadn't seen before. To this day I'm still finding objects around the world this game offers me.
The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is the first 3D Zelda game I've ever owned. This being said, I'm not going to make any connections between this game and Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker, etc.

In terms of the storyline, the Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword takes place before any of the games in the Legend of Zelda franchise. The story begins when we're introduced to a land in the sky known as Skyloft. Link--the protagonist of our epic journey and the character you will be playing as--is on his way to celebrate the ""Wing Ceremony"", a tradition in which he hopes to acquire the label of a Skyloft knight.

In order to become a knight, Link enters a race on a bird-like creature called a Loftwing. After you win the race, Zelda--who hasn't even reached the title of ""princess"" at this point--awards you with a sailcloth; later in the game, this sailcloth will be used as a parachute multiple times throughout the game.

Not too long after Link gains his knighthood he and Zelda are caught in a storm while riding on her Loftwing. Before she can escape, Zelda falls of her Loftwing and makes her way into the land below Skyloft: the unexplored surface.

When Link tells Zelda's father about his daughter's disappearance, he is given knight's clothes. Any fan of the Zelda franchise will recognize this uniform as the green, medieval clothes Link wears in every other Legend of Zelda game. From then on Link makes his way down to the surface and goes on a journey to save his friend.

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword can only be played with the Wii motion plus controller+Nunchuk combo. This being said, you won't be able to play the game with your standard Wii remote. Thankfully for me, my copy of Skyward Sword came with the golden Wiimote with motionplus controls.

By pressing down the A button on your remote, you can make Link move faster with any action he performs. In order to be certain that players won't abuse this, Nintendo added a circular gauge that shows up whenever you use the A button. When this gauge empties, Link will huff and puff and will be rendered too weak to work until the gauge refills itself within a matter of about five seconds.

Holding down the B trigger at the back of your remote will allow you to select a tool to use--whether that tool be your slingshot, your bow, your bug net, etc.

Holding down the C button on your nunchuk will allow you to enter your ""Dowsing"" position, where you'll enter a first-person mode that helps you when looking for people by giving you a radar attribute. By using the motion controls can you point yourself in the direction of who you're looking for while in your ""Dowsing"" mode.

As has been the case with every 3D Zelda game--ever since Ocarina of Time--you have the option of locking onto your enemies. In this game, however, you do so by pressing the Z button on your nunchuk. Whenever a person, monster, or a specific object with is within your reach, you can press the Z button to lock onto and interact with them. If there is not anything you can interact with nearby, pressing the Z button will only shift the camera directly behind Link.

Now for my favorite control of the whole game: the sword controls. Much like the case with many other sword games for the Wii--such as the Red Steel series--you control your sword by swinging your remote around. Thanks to the motion plus you are given when you receive this game, you can thrust your sword in nine directions.

These nine methods of thrusting of your sword can have an impact on how effective your attacks are. For example: a lot of enemies will be able to parry your attacks by holding up a defender at a specific angle. In order to combat against these defensive strategies, you will have to swing your Wiimote in the opposite direction to which your enemy's defender is at. This method of attack calls for much more interaction and strategy to come into your gameplay.

For people who want to kill off their foes with fewer hits, you have the option of unleashing the true power of your sword. Simply by pointing your Wiimote up, Link will follow your action and point his sword ""Skyward"".

Once skyward, your sword will start to charge up with energy. After a matter of about three seconds, your sword will be completely charged up. However, it won't remain charged up for long--so you'll have to use your energy before too long. But when you do use it, a ring will skyrocket from your sword and cut through almost everything in its way. This is a great way to fend off and defeat enemies in a matter of seconds.

I found The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword to be a very enjoyable Wii game. I recommend any Wii owner to pick up a copy of Skyward Sword. Its vast, ever-expanding world will keep you on your toes for hours--not to mention all the action and strategy. While I personally found the game a bit too large for my taste, I'm sure many others will agree that this is still a fantastic game.

If you own a Nintendo Wii and you have plenty of time on your hands, I recommend you at least try this out and see if you like it yourself.",0.005275206681302176
2992,4.0,"The Good: Flawlessly executed, lots of guns, huge world, lots of missions, neat art style, addictive, awesome co-op

The Bad: Almost no story or dialog, repetitive, short, art style is wasted on bland environments

The newest RPG hybrid is probably FPS hybrids and since these are so new Borderlands can be considered one of the first to perfect it. While Fallout 3 holds the crown let's just say Borderlands is the prince. If you have had a hard time grasping FPS/RPG hybrids then let me put it simple for you.
Like in traditional RPGs you have elemental attacks. In Borderlands you have these and they consist of corrosion, explosive, fire, and lightning. Some guns can be fused with elemental powers so i.e. a lightning combat rifle will deplete enemies with shields faster than just a normal rifle. A shotgun with corrosive powers can kill creatures faster than a gun with lightning powers.

Another element that you should be familiar with are stats. Just like TRPGs Borderlands has damage, hit accuracy on weapons. You get shields that have certain aspects such as when they deplete they send a wave of corrosive acid, or they recharge faster, or give you a health boost etc. You also get grenade mods which change the way your grenades act just like guns. There are also specific class mods that can increase some of your stats even further. Additionally, each character has a specific ability they can use and you can equip special spheres that add attributes to this ability. Sound like a TRPG so far? What about enemies? They too have levels and shields and the damage you deal to them will bounce off of them in a series of numbers along with the experience you get once they are killed.

There are a lot of little tidbits such as the money system, you can purchase items or upgrades at vending machines, saving clap trap robots can give you more storage space, there are healing items, when you kill an enemy you can loot them, you can also loot the dungeons you enter or the open world. See, it still sounds like a TRPG. What makes it different? Just add guns, a vehicle you can drive and shoot from, and a fast travel system. The way to play in all this fun is co-op. More players+harder enemies=better loot. Good math in my book.

This sounds fine and dandy like nothing can go wrong, but Borderlands has its issues. While the game play is actually pretty flawless with lots of guns such as rocket launchers, combat rifles, SMGs, and revolvers etc. The content is very thin. There isn't much to do, but run around the barren wasteland completing the 150+ side missions and 50+ story missions. There is hardly a story or any dialog. You're just running around trying to find this Vault with some special treasure. All the loot is the same and even the storage bins you find them in get's boring to see after awhile. While the game has a pretty neat cartoony graphic style everything is brown and boring and it makes the neat art style put to waste.

The difficulty isn't something to complain about since it increases as you level up. Each area has to load separately and the load times are longer than they should be. Most of the side missions vary from scavenger hunts, to killing people, looting, and more killing, but the core game play is really shallow, but the stuff it's wrapped around is flawless. This game is really meant for people who just want a straight forward shooter with some more depth and a twist. While it does feel more arcadey than Fallout 3 and more pick up and play it just doesn't have that charm and amazing feeling to it. Borderlands is executed well, but just needs more filling to make it superb. However, the game is highly addictive and even though you know you're doing the same thing over and over again you never get tired of it. The game has a level 50 cap, and can be completed 100% in less than 20 hours, so Borderlands is a great purchase for any shooter fan.",-0.016275771238752977

2995,4.0,"I thought this wasn't going to be that good but it turned out to be a fun game.

The Gameplay (jrpg)
  If you ever played Diablo 1 through 3, it plays about the same. You begin by choosing one out of 4 classes-a teenage boy warrior(balanced), the humanoid rabbit(heavy melee,weak magic), a mage child(best mage, lowest HP, weak wpn damage) or the lady warrior.(fast and second best at magic) Each class has their own identity and backstory. You also get to pick one out 4 colors to somewhat unique your character and name them whatever you want.
  The game is you clearing floor after flooor of plentiful monsters. Some floors you just need to find the key to advance.
  The combat is real time. It resembles that of a beat em up genre.(final fight or peace keepers snes) Weapons knock enemies into other enemies for more damage.(a domino effect.) You can aim to knock foes into hazards too.(giving bad status change effects.)
  Theres is a temporary boost mode in which you can do deadly special attacks for a limited time.
  4 types of weapons-Sword(the only weapon with a 3 hit combo and knockback whatever it hits on the 3rd hit) holding down the button allows you to block and even send back some projectile attacks at foes.
  Flail-(a one hit,area attack. Knockback all things in range)holding down action-you bring enemies or items to you. If the object is too heavy, you ll pulled torwards it instead.
  Bow-(range attack, mid range homes automatically, no knockback on basic attack)Hold action-Use the bow as a harp to play notes that shortly confuses enemies.
  Finally the Hammer-(Another one hit attack but specializes in knocking foes into each other or hitting an object into foes. Pretty much like a game of Pool)Hold action-Use a shockwave to knock surrounding foes back. Can also use it to destroy spike hazards or break cracked ice.
  Using magic is very tactical in this game. Summoning a spirit, it will detonate in about 5 seconds. Has a large area effect. Can increase power with gems. Pressing the button again will send the spirit flying in the direction your facing til it hits a wall or detonation time runs out. You use support magic by making your character walk into the spirit before it can unleash an attack. Effects varies per summoning in both support and attack magic.-also in what status change is afflicted on foes.

The graphics
The game is 2d. As all ds games, they look much like super nintendo games. The ingame models are as good as ds games gets. Great sprite work.

THE GOOD
Plenty of side quests
There are hidden ones and infinite side quests at dudbear counter.

8 types of attack and support magic.

Great gem fusion system to unlock more stronger abilities if you spend the time to find out.

Gems changes how your characters play.

Wireless offline co op

Bosses make you think outside the box.

Plenty of old faces that a secret of mana fans will remember-same summonings,Watts,Dudbears,Professor Bomb,Treant,Gaia etc.

Great art style that suites mana games.

Good ending-not too short or brief

3 profiles per ds card.(good if you want to share the game with friends or family.)

THE BAD
Some distortions in graphics, that commonly happens.(mainly on game graphics cutscenes)

Conclusion (based on 30 hours Mage Class Lv. 60+ 1 game clear)
The game is a good title to have in your ds collection. Had plenty of fun. I still have yet to try other classes that I ll save for later. Now revisiting secrets of mana on the wii.",0.028614911059764003

2997,4.0,"I always have been a fanatic of driven racing games. Nevertheless, there have been some great games that have really stood out that testament to all racers like Mario Kart for Nintendo, and the sleek and exciting Gran Turismo series for the Playstation 2 system, and the high speed Project Gotham Racing games for the Xbox systems. As for Electronic Arts, the company that has been known for the drama of the highly acclaimed Madden football series, they have definitely known that with the Need For Speed franchise for several systems and computers. Now, that has taken a turn to being most wanted for all gamers.

Need For Speed: Most Wanted for the Playstation 2, is a wild fast and eciting thrill ride, as you goal is to become the number one villain of the underworld of racing. The game here is more like a hybrid cross, bringing the gameplay from the Underground series, while trying to add the element for racers, who were fans of Need For Speed's Hot Pursuit series a few years ago. The game includes several challenges from career mode, which is where you can earn points, and unlock the baddest of automobiles from current classics like the Chevy Cobalt coupe and the Ford Mustang, to exotica with maddening street credibilty like the Ford GT, the Subaru Impreza WRX, and the Lambourghini to the mix as well. The graphics and sound really do stand out well, and bring each element out of the gameplay, while the control is very simple and easy to maintain for all racers alike. The game also includes classics like Circuit, Lap Knockout and Point To Point races, which have been recognized for all classic Need For Speed fans, as well as new gameplays like Toll Booth knockout, which is where you can try going through as many tool booths along the racetrack within the time limit.

All in all, Need For Speed: Most Wanted is a great game for die hard fans of both the Underground series, and a welcome return for anybody who enjoyed the hot pursuit days too. While I honestly wish that this could've had more locations rather than one big area to play in, it still remains a whole lot of fun. I love this driven game, and for anybody who has the Playstation 2, you'll like this fast & furious speed.

3004,5.0,"What can one say when a game sucks you in so completely that time seems to collapse in on itself and become meaningless? Homeworld is one those rare games that is so solid that it really evolves as you play it. It does this  by providing the player with a rock-solid background story backed up by  superior game play. I highly reccommend that players READ the manual before  playing, because it gives you a tremendous amount of race history that  builds up the mystique for the race that you become responsible for.  Gameplay is relatively easy to master, and the learning curve is pretty  flat. It takes some getting used to the 3D battle field and selecting ships  to attack, and the fact that you cannot pause the action to assign targets  to attack is annoying, but beyond that if you practice you will get the  hang of it quickly.  I say visual and aural feast because it is! The  ship design is excellent, reminescent of Babylon 5 and Dream Pod 9's Mekton  sourcebooks for the Jovian Chronicles RPGs. The music is both subtle and  awe inspiring at the same time with its majestic and powerful choral  accompaniments that tug at your emotions as sure as the importance of  seeing the Mothership and her precious cargo safely to the homeworld.  If you've come here to expect blood splattering on walls or pouring out  windows, inconveniencing passersby with the spray, you will be  disappointed. This game is not 'extreme' nor does it 'kick @ss', instead it  inspires and propagates a whole host of emotions bordering on an intensity  rarely seen in a game before.  The story is equal to that of such epics  as Starcraft & Broodwar, and Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight (I know it's  an FPS and not an RTS, but I'm talking about story not game type). It makes  getting the Mothership home an imperative and not just a reason to see the  end cut scene.  Additionally, YES has performed the title track for the  game, and itself is a nine minute epic, (as is most of Yes' music), that  compliments the game. When a supergroup like Yes pays attention to a video  game, it must be something special. HOMEWORLD is for anyone who loves  science fiction and good gaming all rolled into one.",0.023825965751814497

3006,5.0,"Ok, Bond fans, it's happened. 007: Everything or Nothing (EoN) is simply the best Bond game to date. Previous Bond games attempted to emulate the success of the n64's Goldeneye, and all of them inevitably fell short. EoN does not do this. It tries something completely new, and this is why it succeeds.
EoN drops the first-person shooter mold and gives gamers a third-person perspective a la Splinter Cell. Now, we get to actually see Bond in action. This adds an entirely new aspect to the game, and stealth plays a bigger role than ever before. Also, Bond has been given a new set of hand-to-hand combat moves, but let's face it, why bother with the hand-to-hand combat when you can easily accumulate head shots with your PP7 and Bond's auto-aim locking button? The auto-aim has the ups and downs of any typical third-person videogame. Sometimes you find yourself locking on the wrong guy as someone two feet to your right opens up on you with a machinegun. You just learn to deal with it.
Like the last 007 game, Nightfire, EoN does everything it can to get you to feel as if you're playing in a James Bond film. You put in the game, press power, and James Bond shoots at the camera. Then the game drops you off in a pre-credit sequence. Upon completion, EoN launches into credits and its theme song, sung by Mya. EoN takes it to the next level by having all the characters in the game modeled after and voiced by real-life popular actors including Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe (as the villian), and Shannon Elizabeth. The Willem Dafoe character even has ties with an old Bond villian, Max Zorin from ""A View to a Kill."" The old henchman, JAWS, also is invited to the party, and before you know it, you're going toe-to-toe with JAWS in a high-speed train! The extra effort by EA to make this seem like a Bond movie really pays off.
There's a lot to do in the game, and the variety of gameplay is unparalleled in any Bond game to date. In one level you find yourself in a car race; in another, you're jumping off a cliff to rescue a falling damsel in distress; and in yet another, you're on your motorcyle dodging exploding canisters on the interstate. Let's not forget that Bond also manages to pilot a helicopter in one level and a tank in another. Oh yeah, and what about Bond's Aston Martin? That shows up, too. There's plenty to do in this Bond game, enough to make it worth your ever precious dollars. The vehicle levels are all improved from previous Bond entries.
The replay value is high as well. There are plenty of things to unlock, including new levels, cheats, and modes of gameplay (including an Arena mode). There are multiple options for multi-player. Besides Arena, there is a multi-player Co-op mode where you choose from different Mi:6 agents and go through chapters specifically created for the Co-op mode. In fact, it is in Co-op mode where most of your options and secrets for the Arena are unlocked. There are only a few ""classic"" Bond bad-guys to unlock for the arena, including Baron Samedi and OddJob. But who else do you really want?
EoN is a game for people who like a lot of variety in their gameplay and enjoy the Splinter Cell or Mission: Impossible kind of games, mixing stealth with action. The single player story mode seems fuller than previous Bond entries, and in my opinion, the reply value is higher than any other, maybe with the exception of Goldeneye. This game just gives you more of everything: more gadgets, more women, more vehicles, more options, more everything that makes you want to play a Bond game. In short, if you're a fan of Bond, James Bond, I think you will love this game.",0.021822990504145795

The PSP is intuitive, fits well in my hand, has remarkable battery life, uses UMDs which are basically CDs in a protective case, is lightweight yet sturdy, and has wireless capabilities built in.

I have already mated this thing to my PS3 and am able to have access (as long as you have a WiFi signal to use) to my PS3 from ANYWHERE.  I have a network harddrive that my PS3 is also networked to, which gives me the 320GB in my PS3 and the 500GB on my network to store music, movies, pictures, and whatever else I need to for use on my PSP.  I'm hoping to have a job soon that requires a bit of travel every now and again so that's what this console was intended for.  However, I have found myself time and again sitting in the car or on break and reaching over for this little gem.

I have yet to try EchoChrome (wish the silver version had come with Everyday Shooter) but expect it to be pretty sweet.  Through the PlayStationStore you can buy PSP games or classic PSOne games for use on both your PS3 console and the PSP.  The PSP has access to the PlayStationStore, allowing the purchase and download of games directly to your MS Pro Duo.  I will have to go another route for this kind of purchase, as I have a MS Pro Duo adapter on the way that will convert two Micro SDHC cards into one solid memory stick.  I essentially just got 16GB of storage for my PSP for around $40, but cannot download to it directly from the PlayStationStore (from what I've read but will try later).

Haven't watched National Treasure 2 (althought a friend nabbed the PSP and watched the movie before I could even get R&C: SM open) but it appeared to display well.

Even the sound coming from this little guy is impressive.  I have yet to use the built in microphone.  Updating firmware is done rather simply through the USB cable on the computer, but now should be capable with access to the PlayStationNetwork over a WiFi connection.

Everything.

The bad?
The main character controls like he's on ice skates.

The story is light hearted but draws you in and makes this game just plain fun. One down side I was little disappointed with is there's no voice acting. You have to read everything. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the games who use voice actors. I don't mind reading. But I think voices would add personality to the characters. Not a big deal though. The controls take a little getting used to and there's a lot to remember. But once you get used to them they are rock solid. The camera can get a little annoying but it's much better than most games.

So far its been a week and I can almost tell by hearing if I'm playing the wrong note or far enough from the correct fret. I can't comment if rocksmith can teach advanced technique but I'm getting basics down like sustains, chords, slides, etc.

Pros:
Good assortment of music
Plenty of arcade and retro games to teach you chords, controlling how loud your guitar is, finding frets, etc.
Tons of lessons on what seems like everything, down to changing strings.
Usable by a guy who has never touched a guitar though

Cons:
Requires disc import tool if you own the original rocksmith to port the first games tracks to 2014. DLC doesn't require the tool.
The game activates on steam and still requires an additional uplay signin.
My Logitech G35 doesn't work, I get an audio error and haven't found a fix. I just plugged in standard headphones into my computer though and they work perfectly.

Though the 2 games are completely different, where this game is much more of a 1st person view as opposed to the 3rd person in the Atari and C64, this game is better. This PS2 game is more engaging and challenging as you must complete 14 different missions around the scenic world. The game can get frustrating if you get stuck on a mission for too long gloom, and doom thoughts can appear(this happened to me on a mission where you have to destroy the evil twin car), however, the exhilaration that I felt after I finally successfully completed the mission and eventually the game is unparalleled. I successfully completed the whole game in 1 week, and went back after winning and re-completed missions where I didn't get the movie afterwards.(This happens when I completed missions where I was badly damaged and my car transformed into a motorcycle or boat into a jet-ski).

When i started playing i realized how much i missed the old adventure game point and click years.  This is a fantastic game, the dialogue is very well written.  Its that old adventure game formula, you find items, chat with the locals, solve puzzles and use trial and error when determining which item will get you to the next area.  I really like the colorful hand drawn backgrounds and characters.  I think i have the most fun when im questioning someone and i just click on each individual item i have just to see what they will say.  For instance, early in the game you receive a stained tissue paper and reading what each person says about it as you shove it in their face is hilarious.  This DS version of Broken Sword has rekindled my love of point and click adventure games and i hope to see more coming to the DS in the future.

3064,5.0,"I didn't think I would ever need this until a friend turned me on to playstation home network. Playstation started this Sims style network in mid december, basically it's a version of Second life, the online sims style game that has over 80 million subscribers. If you get involved in this fad you'll defitnitly need this device. Anyway I was surprised to find that, unlike with the 360 keypad, the PS3's has its own battery and has to be charged separately to be used. Instead of plugging into the PS3 controller, which may not even be possible, the PS3's keypad uses Blutooth to connect to the Playstation 3.

The keypad easily slips onto the Playstation 3 with the help of two small clamps. Typing with the keypad is about as easy as using the 360's which snaps on (quite roughly) to the bottom of a 360 controller. That is to say, it's not exactly easy, but still much better than trying to use a controller to input text.

The keypad also has a couple of neat extras built into. There are buttons for instant access to both the message box and friends list. Pushing either button in game pauses the game and brings up the box or list instantly.

The pad also has a touchpad mode. Turning this on turns the keypad into a full on touchpad. It seems to work quite well, though I couldn't find any reasons to use it besides web browsing. Still a very nice feature.

Most importantly, the keypad's light design and above-the-controller location makes it completely unnoticeable when you're gaming. While the 360 keypad is fairly out of the way, over time it annoyed me because the palms of my hands sort of rested on it. Not so with this keypad, it's practically invisible when you're playing.

Is it worth a purchase? Sure, if texting with a controller drives you nuts. Otherwise I'd maybe hold off until I felt a need for a keypad on the controller.",0.03383408919123204

The awesome:
I really enjoyed the gameplay and the story actually made me laugh in points with the character interactions! Very well done.
I took many screen shots while playing and have them as Screensavers and some I made into postcards to send to people :) So that's my way of saying the graphics and art direction is simply amazing! Seriously this game is a joy to play and even watch.
The combat is fun and satisfying with the flying Axe being a unique addition. The upgrading is simple as the story progresses.

The not so awesome:
This is my only gripes with the game I had. First is the controls take a while to get used to but after muscle memory kicks in you'll be surprised at what you can pull off.
And lastly since there is a slight leveling system, there was a point where I was exploring and came across some higher level enemies that one shot me. That I felt was a cheap game over :(

3086,5.0,"I'm so happy I'm a forum member of Slickdeals because I got a email today about this being $3.99! I was about 13 years old when I bought my PS2 just to play GTA III. A kid down the street had it and I was still playing PS1 and N64, and when I went into his house and he showed me PS2 with GTA III, I was like OMG, I must HAVE THIS. Went home told Mom, took me a couple weeks but I finally got her to budge. GTA: III was released I believe in 2001, so for its time, it was very good. I then discovered Vice City being announced, and to this day, I still remember going on the official GTA website and seeing the flash animation for Vice City. Some of you may remember it. It was like a flash of a room, and you would see people walk past the window, and you could click on stuff inside the room like a radio and stuff. I preordered Vice City, and when it came, it was like a WHOLE NEW ADVENTURE for the GTA series. Vice City was the first GTA game to include boats, motorcycles, etc, and boy was Vice City fun.

Soon after San Andreas came out which was a BIG BIG BIG BIG DEAL. San Andreas was the LARGEST OPEN WORLD GAME in the series being 5 times larger than Vice City and also brought a ton of features to the series. Like bicycles, jets, working out, eating, stuff to make it real more realistic than ever. Anyway, then it happened, and happened to THOUSANDS of people. The INFAMOUS ERROR!

""  Error reading the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas disc ""

This stopped THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS of people from playing the game. To this day, I still can't find a real LEGIT fix to this issue. My disc was completely free of smudges or scratches, and ALL OTHER games worked just fine for hours on end. I can't truthfully say it was the disc or the optical reader. As both worked fine. It had something to do with the disc itself I believe. People think when you burn a CD, it burns into the disc itself but it doesn't. If you turn a CD upside down, you'll see the shininess right? That's actually the bottom of the label where data is written onto. If you take a knife and scratch the label, and turn it upside down, you'll see you just ripped some of that shininess away. Sure, you can scratch the plastic and then it can't read but that's because it can't see through the scratched plastic to read the paper. I'm thinking the PS2 laser started eating through the data paper on the disc due a issue when the games were mass produced and it eventually wore down the material on the disc, and the system just couldn't read it.

Anyway, found this for $3.99 as a digital download for my PS3, and I snatched it. Now, I can finally finish playing without any kind of issues.  I remember having like ONE MORE area to claim for my gang and I would of had all of them when this happened to me so it's time to finish what I started.",-0.00858374124460712

3090,5.0,"To start, I am a Rockstar games fan, especially the Grand Theft Auto franchise. I own GTA V for PS3 and Ive played my moneys worth and more. In the past 6 months, GTA online has started to go downhill, less people, less DLC, the fading promise of heists online. Even I, as an avid GTA player, has gotten bored with it. When the Next gen announcements came, I wasn't to excited, I figured a few more shiny objects to please the masses. Then I looked deeper. I purchased the game for PS4, and i purchased a PS4 to play this game. There are so many improvements and changes, it is worth $60 more.

The Aesthetics, Rockstar is known for detail. The previous gen was very detailed, but the new gen blows it out of the water! The way the grass moves and The rain falls. The graphics are not quite as great as the trailers,  but impressive to say the least. The way vehicles respond to impacts is more realistic. The draw distance Is amazing, You can pick A car's headlight in the distance, zoom in with your rifle and see it the car. There are more people, more traffic,  a variety of weather,  all making for a more immersive experience.

New modes and Items, I couldn't possibly cover everything, so I will just cover my favorites. The first person mode Is awesome! Fully functional gauges in a cockpit view is something i've always liked in games, GTA V does it great. Flying is my absolute favorite activity in GTA, I am an aircraft mechanic and though the gauges aren't perfect, I really enjoy this new mode. If you've already beaten the single player,  I suggest playing it again in first person mode,  it's well worth the time.  Now I did own the previous gen, so I recieved a few extra things for upgrading,  the rail gun and the modified Duke. All insignificant extras,  but it was nice to have some extras thrown in for the players that upgrade.

The online: I was concerned that upgrading and transferring from my ps3 to ps4 would have issues. The transfer was smooth and easy.  All vehicles,  weapons and items transferred just fine for me. The limit is still two properties,  there was a rumor a player could own 3. Unfortunately not.  The collectors edition items such as the carbon RS,  Hot Knife,  and Bullpup shotgun are now unlocked for everyone.  That's somthing I've been waiting a long time for. Unfortunately,  I was hoping for animals in gta online,  but that isn't a feature,  maybe in future updates.  Rockstar has also promised heists to be the first update,  but that promise comes with allot of warented skepticism.

My verdict: If you couldn't already tell, I liked it. Its not just the common re-release, It improves and adds to the already great experience. Its well worth another $60 if you've owned it before, and if you haven't played it yet, You're missing out!",0.0400925047184935

Fourteen of which must be unlocked first, either through several matches, classic mode or the games adventure mode.  There are also a plethora of new stages as well as a few classic ones thrown in from Super Smash Bros. Melee.  There are also new items and a whole new slew of extras to be found within this game.  Simply put, this game is huge and won't keep you busy for just weeks, but months on end.  Perhaps even years.

There are two big single player modes to trump through.  First, there is classic mode which is not much different from the classic mode presented in Melee.  You'll fight battles either one on one, two on two, three on one or a giant version of a character.  There are also team battles and ""Metal Menaces"" to fight.  You'll also see the return of Master Hand and Crazy Hand.  Classic Mode can now be done with a friend instead of just by yourself as well.

However, the real deal in single player is easily the Subspace Emissary.  Brawl's own adventure mode.  The adventure mode here actually includes a story.  The story is a little confusing at first.  Mainly because there's no voice acting or even written dialog between the characters.  You'll eventually grasp on to it, though, and even come to like it.  The story even comes off as somewhat epic.  The adventure mode here is much more fleshed out than in Melee.  You'll fight an abundance of characters and have an abundance of characters join your ranks.  You'll fight through chaotic boss fights and intricately designed levels.  And you don't even have to go through adventure mode alone.  A friend can fight alongside and many moments in the story call for more than one character to go through a certain level.  The other good thing about going through Adventure Mode is that it can be a different experience on a subsequent play.  Even better, however, is that the Adventure Mode is not that short.  It will easily take you anywhere from nine to ten hours to complete it the first time, and you'll end up having to play a second time just to snag all the trophies.

Of course, the real treasure of any Smash Bros. game is the multiplayer aspect.  Brawl doesn't disappoint.  The matches are fierce and there are a ton of new things.  As in the previous games, players go to a level where they battle against either other players or the computer.  There are several new items added this time around.  There's the sticky bomb, which sticks to a character until it detonates.  There's the assist trophy which works a lot like the Pokeball and many more.  The most important new item, though, is easily the Final Smash.  The Final Smash is a devastating attack that usually serves as a one hit kill.  You'll probably want to check out every character's Final Smash skill at least once.  These aren't just the most powerful attacks in the game, they're some of the coolest looking as well.

Super Smash Bros. Brawl also supports four different controller functions.  The Wii Remote by itself, the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, the Classic Controller and the Gamecube Controller.  All of these controls are decent, but the Gamecube controller is easily the best of the lot.  The controls are mapped out exactly like Super Smash Brothers Melee.  Anyone who played Melee to no end will easily find comfort in the controls here.  Regardless of what control function you use, the controls are tight and highly responsive.

The best part about Brawl, however, may very well be all the extras.  You've got a series of trophies to collect and characters to unlock, but there's a lot more than just these things.  You can also unlock soundtrack selections and new stages as well.  In addition to all these things you can also save some matches and watch them again.  Brawl also gives you the option of creating your own levels and saving screenshots.  This is in addition to some of the things that returned from Melee such as Event Battles and the Homerun Contest.  There's so much to be explored within this game.  Brawl also goes online, and being able to fight people anywhere is amazing.

Super Smash Bros. Brawl also looks and sounds incredible.  The graphics being the best the Wii has yet.  The stages themselves look absolutely incredible.  The backgrounds are highly detailed.  The music here is some of the best to grace the gaming world.  Nintendo got some of the most famous composers in the industry to contribute music and the soundtrack doesn't disappoint.

Is Brawl perfect?  No.  While it's nice to go online you'll still have to deal with friend codes and there's no way to voice chat or communicate with the people you're playing against online.  When playing with friends, it'd be nice to be able to say something.  The game also suffers from some fairly long load times.  And while Adventure Mode is a treat, the last few hours of the run can become extremely repetitive.

Despite all this, Super Smash Brawl is a must buy for Super Smash Brothers fans.  If you enjoyed Super Smash Brothers Melee and the original title that started it all, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is a real treat to own.",0.028688265934402605
3102,5.0,If you like this type of game this is the best of them all. Graphics are some of the best ever seen. Only game that maybe better is Uncharted 2. Story is excellent.

3103,5.0,"So far its working great, I love it and so do my kids.  I will update the review if anything changes. Delivered on time from Amazon.  Only thing that would be cooler is if they threw in the extra $10 PSN credit (20 total) that launch day buyes from gamestop, newegg, best buy got when buying the PS+ and launch edition PS4.

They did however retroactively match the buy 2 get one free including the bundled BF4.  BF4 is engaging, resogun is a must have, PS+ for a year (13 months if you add the month then add the year) overall great bundle.",0.05484737484737485
3104,5.0,"The best thing about this game is the combat. It is excellent, if you don't mind working fast with both of your hands at the same time (one on the stylus, one on the keys). The depth is very impressive for a DS game. Furthermore, you can really challenge your skills by reducing your level and increasing the difficulty (yielding better drops). Monster behavior is quite diverse, and if you want to excel at combat, it will take you a lot longer than just finishing the storyline.

That said, if you can't stand button mashing, you might be frustrated at times. Also, ultimately you are still bound by the rules of RPG -- regardless of how good your skills are, you can always achieve all the game's objectives by simply putting enough time into the game.

The storyline is very good, but the characters are barely decent (or worse, depending on your taste).

The game has a lot of unique features that are just fun to learn about.

Music is excellent if you like j-pop. Overall feel and quality of the game is also excellent, despite being set in a modern Tokyo (which is kinda less fun than middle-earth dungeons and dragons, IMO).

Overall, I consider it one of the top DS games.

3139,5.0,"I bought this Sims 4 Get To Work expansion pack on Origin because I was able to get a good deal on it. I am not saying this expansion pack isn't worth the regular price of $40, but it's a lot of money for me to spend right now so I wait for a good sale to come around for The Sims 4 expansion packs before I buy them. I have really wanted this expansion pack for a while but I wasn't sure I would like everything about it particularly the idea of my Sims getting sick a lot and the fact that this expansion pack comes with aliens. So far, the illnesses and the aliens have not really affected my gameplay and I have played with it a few days now. I really like the idea of the detective career that comes with this expansion pack, but it is hard and a little discouraging at first because my Sims was given a tough first case and I couldn't find any clues, so the game said my Sim did a terrible job the first day. At least my Sims wasn't fired I guess. The doctor career started out much smoother for another one of my Sims that I tried it with. The doctor career is easier in my opinion, but maybe I am just better at being a doctor/healthcare provider. The detective career is fun and gets easier to do after a few days of doing it since your Sim will get promoted and you get different cases and assignments to do with it. I haven't tried out the Scientist career yet, but I wasn't excited about that one really since I am not a Science fan. I will eventually try it out probably since it is supposed to be fun to do. The retail businesses sound and look fun too, but I am more interested in trying out the actual careers right now so I will wait on trying those out. The retail businesses are flexible because you can sell anything in them as long as it's in buy mode or you make, as far as I understand it, which is nice. This expansion pack comes with a lot of new hairstyles, clothing, and accessories which is impressive and appealing to me also because I love getting new hairstyles, clothing, and accessories for my Sims to use. I also like that you can decide if you want to go to work with your Sims or if you want to let them go by themselves for the three new careers that come with this expansion pack. I would have liked it if this expansion pack came with a few more careers like the ghost hunter and education careers, but I understand that only so many careers can be included in it.  I would recommend this Sims 4 Get To Work expansion pack because it comes with lots of new objects/items and it adds a lot of new gameplay and career options.",0.05074766651662947

I'm just surprised I can't keep myself from shaking during and after I play the game.

3144,5.0,"I purchased this keyboard from Newegg a couple years ago when I built my computer. The backlit keys was a huge selling point, as well as the Logitech brand. I own Logitech speakers and a Logitech mouse and the customer support is just brilliant. Apart from that, the fact that its a ""gaming"" keyboard and I of course play games made it an instant purchase.

Now, I enjoy eating and drinking at my desk while watching movies and such. Every once in a while, accidents happen. I have spilled water on this keyboard 3 times and coffee once and it still works as if I had just unboxed it yesterday. I just flipped it upside down, shook most of the water off and then stuck it in a tub of rice for a couple hours. After that I just plug it back into my computer and carry on what I was doing. Even if I did manage to ruin the keyboard, I'm 100% Logitech would easily replace it for me. They have with various of their products in the past and its great to have that safe of mind when buying pricey electronics.

One thing to note however is that the blue backlighting isn't as bright as the red. That was a bit disappointing, but its still quite clear and easily readable so no biggie. Another thing is that I have never used the G-keys. I don't know if that's a con for anyone but just a thought.

Overall, I'd highly recommend this keyboard to anyone who wants a quality product. For under $100, you get a great backlit keyboard with great customer support. I'm planning to upgrade to the Logitech G710+ soon (hopefully Logitech releases a blue version because I have a black and blue color setup) but for the time being, this keyboard does the job and more.",0.03880400865908113
3145,5.0,"I got this game some weaks after it came out and it is very fun and addicting.  First Person Shooter but a small selection of weapons.  You have the ability to carry med packs to regain a certain amount of health and pain pills to give that extra boost to get you to the safe house.  The grafix are not the gratest but the fun and replayability is awesome.  It doesnt matter what edition of the game you get becuase the contect that the Game of the Year has can be downloaded for free.  Since the news of Left 4 Dead 2, their have been several petions that Left 4 Dead 2 should not come out since it has only been a year.

Single player:  Their are 4 missions and the object of the game is to get from point A to B to C to D and then E.  Every point their is a safe house where the zombies cannot get you.  In their their will be weapons, ammo and health to fix yourself up.  You then open the door and start heading to the next safe house until you get to the extraxtion point.  Then its mission over and thier is only 4 missions all together.  The Bots are not that smart and you should not play with them on the hardest setting.

With the free download of survival, its like Gears 2 Horde mode or Halo ODST FireFight.  Wave after wave of zombies come at you while you kill them.  And their is also more DLC on the way.

Multiplayer:  Its 4 vs. 4 to play on the campain maps.  You start as who ever you want to start as (Infected or survivor) and play through the regular campain but you which sides once the surviors get to the safe house.  When you play as the infected, its rendom so you cant pick who you want to be like smoker, hunter boomer or tank.  Each one has its advantages and disadvantages so you have to work as a team no matter which team your on.

If you have not played this game yet then you need to play it.  I recommend that if you have other people to play with on the campain or multiplayer then you should definatly get it.  Low replay value if you don't have live or nobody to split screen with at home.",0.015621788701747437

Pros:

*Macro keys: I love this feature.  They are easy to program.  You just press the ""macro record"" key, select a macro key, and then hit whatever key combo you need.  Press the record key again and you're done.  I have used this for various things, including:

  *Remapping W, A, S, D to the keypad (I'm left handed).  Some games don't let you use the arrow keys.
  *Making multi-key combos into a single keypress (I use Shift+space to read through my Google reader from the oldest to the newest.

*Volume knob: This is wonderful too.  The thing that annoys me most about video games is that once it's running, you can no longer adjust the Windows volume level.  If I turned it down while on the web, I had to exit the game to turn it on again.

*The keypad is removable: yes, you can move it from side to side, but you can also get it out of the way completely if you don't need it.

*The cruise control button is also nice (and it may help with those people having the ""Ctrl+W+R"" problem).

*Good solid construction overall.

Cons:

*Like others have mentioned, the keys have been rearranged some.  I have definitely found myself pressing ""~"" at odd times.

*The backlight (which can be turned off) makes the keyboard hard to look at when the lights are on.  As I am not in the habit of gaming in the dark, this stays off most of the time.

*The knob for the volume seems a little flimsy.  I'm not sure how it will hold up in the long run.

*You are supposed to install the software before plugging in the keyboard.  This could be problematic if you don't already have a keyboard.

**************

Final thoughts:

This is a solid keyboard, and I like it a lot.  Until I found this one in the store, it never occurred to me that there were keyboards with macro keys (for a reasonable price).  I am very happy with this purchase.",0.04479149099057566
3152,5.0,"I had a hard time finding a decent Xbox One chat headset because I didn't like Microsoft's big uncomfortable model. This is very lightweight and the mic boom rotates up out of the way and it can be bent as well (it's not rigid plastic). The cord is just the right length, not too short, not too long. The adjustable head piece is plastic and round and is supposed to wrap around the upper/back part of your head, not straight over the front/top (note the round shape). I moved it around for a while to find the perfect position and then forgot I had it on while playing Minecraft with my kids for 4 hours. I'm buying them two of these since chatting with the Kinect is annoying and interferes with audio. The cord has a built-in volume knob with microphone mute.

3153,5.0,"For the platformers being released this year(2004), Sly 2:Band of Thieves has got a good running start on the rest of the pack. The developers fixed everything that was wrong with the first one(namely it being too short & too easy), made the graphics look even better and fine tuned the gameplay so that players will get more out of the game this time. Sly 2: Band of Thieves blends several gameplay elements together, including stealth, thievery, platform adventure, combat/fighting, strategy, and exploration, into one huge world. The tale begins with Sly and his gang discovering that parts of Clockwerk are missing, and they embark to ensure Clockwerk is never reassembled. You go across numerous locations, including Paris, Prague, India, the Canadian Wilderness and more doing your best to retrieve those parts of Clockwerk. There's even new moves such as pick-pocketing, vent crawls, rooftop chases, plus a team of unique playable characters. It took Sucker Punch over two years to make a sequel to the first game and it shows. They should be applauded on a job well done. They're definitely leading the pack at the moment so everyone else should do their best to be even better.

This game is, like mg a 3rd person shooter, where you play as a member of the swat team. There are also 3 different endings, depending on how fast you beat the game. The normal baddies are quite stupid, except the one that have knives, but the bosses are just plain awesome. Some have machine guns, rocket launchers, and even two guns. The only bad thing is that you only get 4 weapons in the game. BUT, THAT IS WHERE MP COMES IN. The multiplayer on this game is, to me, better that any of the james bond games. To start off you only get the five swat team members, and, yes only 4 guns. But, after you beat the game on hard, you unlock all the other characters, which fills the bottom half of the character select screen. It's awesome, you can play as banderas(my favorite) who has two guns! All th bad guys you chose have infinite ammo, but they cannot put there backs against the wall. This takes great strategy as to who you choose compared with who your friends choose. The only, i repeat, only thing this game could use in mp is bots, but aside from that, this is one of my top ten for n64.",0.01924264007597341

3161,5.0,"I rented this game because I was never much of a fan of the Rainbow Six series but people told me this game was good. They weren't wrong, this game is fantastic. Along the same lines as other sneak titles like Hitman and Thief, this game requires the player rely on stealth more than firepower. However, that isn't to say that it doesn't have its splendid moments of gratifying carnage. Let me put it into bulletpoints.
1) This game has some of the best AI I have ever seen in a game. The enemy actively searches you out and is excellent at taking cover and even at pinning you down. It even has the enemy work as a team at times - which can be frustrating yes, but always fun.
2) Graphics are top notch. I really can't emphasize this enough. I'm still astounded by the amount of care that went into designing this game.
3) There are so many ways to dispatch with your enemy - take your pick. Grenades, bullets, sniper rifle, various stun weapons, even a bottle to the head. There is definite replayability here.
4) Cool, cool gadgets. Including a nice pair of night vision goggles with an infared setting.
5) Decent cutscenes - they could have been better
6) The fact that you can take the enemy hostage and use him as a human shield was a definite plus.
7) Challenging, but not impossible. I usually end up getting frustrated and cheat with most games. Not the case here. The learning curve is perfect - always a challenge, but I never threw down my controller in disgust (okay, maybe once).
8) Convenient save points prevent you from getting too far and then dying - so you never need to restart from the beginning of a level. Best of all, its automatic.
While the game has its frustrations - sometimes mission objectives can be a bit muddy and there are levels where you can't kill anyone (including a super cool level in which you break into the CIA) forcing you to rely on arguably less entertaining non-lethal methods of dispatching with your foe - overall this is a solid game worth every gaming penny that you might spend. Although I finished the game in a little over a week of solid play, I will most likely buy it in the near future. I'm sure it will only get better the second time through.",0.030500044826967894

I'm 36 and have never snowboarded but skateboarded as a teenager.  Snowboarding with the balance board is EXACTLY what I remember about skateboarding.  Except now I'm 40 pounds heavier and 22 years older!  I played this for 3 hours the first night and woke up the next day, got out of bed, and my entire lower body was sore.  I do a lot of walking and some eliptical training but I used core muscles in this game that I don't think I've used in 20 years!  Since I'm old I now turn off the included music and crank up New Order and the Psychedelic Furs while playing this game.  I find that if you don't switch sides (put your right foot in front) regularly your left calf gets sore from grinding.

Let me just say that when I am busting out the solo to Pearl Jam's ""Alive"" on Rock Band 2, I ""feel"" more like I am playing guitar than I ever did during the many years I tried to play a real guitar :-)  Unlike a real guitar it only takes a few hours and a good imagination to rock out.

3174,5.0,"How many ideal ""interactive"" games out there? Games like Final Fantasy VII claimed to be cinematic, yet you do 30+ over hours running around and fighting random monsters. Metal Gear Solid series is another, yet despite clever plot twists and addictive gameplay, it fails to be an ideal ""interactive"" game. Now if we're saying which are better games, any MGS title would've beat this to pulp. James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing is perfect in it's own way. It doesn't throw a puny 5-second CGI for every few hours of teddlesome quests or 10-minute CGI for every few minutes of key-fetching work (a reputation of Metal Gear Solid 2). You get fast and furious action with exciting cinematics perfectly complimented each other.
Ok, I lied. The story is a disappointment and pretty much rehashed any average Bond movie to date. The voice-casts are excellent though what surprises me is model Ito Misaki displaying a commendable English even better than her counterparts like Michelle Yeoh (great, can we see her in a Hollywood movie next? She's was convincing in Ju-On: The Grudge movie). Too bad her lines were too bloody few, along with Willem Dafoe and Mya. I guess voice-acting in a video game does give you very limited roles. Pierce Brosnan shines and does not disappoint here given plenty of lines for him compared with other casts. His one-liners are perfectly captured with that trademark Bond charisma and coolness. It'll be idiotic to dump Mr Brosnan now for the next Bond film. I can't think Orlando Bloom or Hugh Jackman could ever possess half a quality of a Bond that Brosnan, Sir Sean Connery and even Roger Moore possesses.
Now, for the gameplay. It's a bit tad easy with players doing lock-ons 100% of the time. The big flaw is the lack of manual targetting that 3rd person games like MGS had. The shooting levels are exciting, but lacked depth of that Goldeneye or Perfect Dark games. It is simply because the generous and easy lock-on controls that this game possess. The shooting levels are thankfully awesome with trademark Bond gadgets thrown in such as Q Spiders, Nano-suit, Coin-granades and Gun Rapple. When it comes to automobile missions, EoN rules the lot. You're given missiles, machine-gun turrets, flamethrower and Bond-in-built gadgets such as Nano-stealth and remote controlled RC cars. There's an intense Midnight Run level set in a nightime urban city, train chase thoughtout an Egyptian ruin and an interactive Matrix Reloaded Trinity-on-a-bike-against-freeway-traffic tribute where Bond must race on a freeway stopping Jaws' trailer from blowing up a city.
The bonus extras for this game are Production Stills which must be unlocked by exceptional rating and an ""exclusive"" multiplayer co-op missions. Too bad this game falls flat compared to Goldeneye and Perfect Dark when it comes to multiplayer goodness.
I am not sure if this game warrants a purchase because even though in every aspect it deserves a high rating, the depth and longetivity is questionable. A must rent and a must buy for true Bond fans.",0.014499788710315027

3185,5.0,"I just didn't see it coming.  I sure thought 'inFAMOUS' would be another pathetic open world superhero game like 'Spiderman' / 'Hulk' / 'Superman' or 'Assassin's Creed' (which was a huge let-down for me) rip-off.  What 'Sucker Punch' has created is a refreshing take on the 3rd person action platformer like 'Jak and Daxter' series or its own 'Sly Cooper' series with a twist of comic book superhero origin story set in the Dystopian near future.

If you have been hugely disappointed by GTA IV or Assassin's Creed like many people have, let me assure you; 'inFAMOUS' is not is another GTA or Assassin's Creed clone.  It is an exciting and addictive action game combined with strong platforming mechanics, but most of all, the game offers solid storyline that oozes with highly stylized comic book sensibility.

You are Cole McGrath, an ordinary man stuck with a super power that enables you to manipulate electricity after the mysterious but devastating explosion that put 'Empire City' in lawless ruin.  You need to unravel the mystery behind the incident by traversing around the three islands of 'Empire City' (which is conveniently quarantined from the mainland) and take main quest along with many optional side quests to level up and unlock more super powers and become stronger.

The gameplay progresses just like 'Jak 2' or 'Jak 3'.  You take a mission for the main quest.  Between each mission, you can freely roam around the city and take the optional side quests you unlocked.  Story is progressed by radio conversation and comic book-styled cutscene. The cutscene is especially cool and highly stylized with some cool camera techniques and motion technology.

Although you don't get to use any weapon or ride vehicle, your ability to manipulate electricity enables you to muster various destructive power to dispatch baddies and manuever to move around the city in style, and it's a blast to use the electical power you possess.  As you get stronger, you will really feel like a comic book superhero that put Spidey or Hulk in shame.

There are two paths you take; Good or Evil.  Each path will unlock different super powers and side quests, and eventually lead to different ending.  Moral choice you get to make is important to shape your own path in the storyline.

It takes good 20-25 hours to finish the game on one path.  There are several different types of collectibles scattered throughout the city and the city is quite large.  There are tons of unlockable Trophy.  'inFAMOUS' definitely has some longevity and replay value.  It doesn't just claim so, it definitely delivers so.

The best part of the gameplay to me is the way you traverse in such style as you can scale any buildings and structures with such ease, jump from rooftop to rooftop, smoothly slide on the electrical wires and rails, and glide and hover around in the air.  Any combination of these abilities and the city is your playground.  The platforming mechanics are much more intuitive and accurate than 'Assassin's Creed' and 'Spider-man'.  The game might look like another 3rd person shooter but there are plenty of platforming in the game.

As far as free-roaming, open world game goes, GTA III Trilogy and Jak Trilogy are still the best, but 'inFAMOUS' comes really close to the standard set by the renowned series and offers something much refreshing than most that have tried to imitated the success of GTA.  Maybe the inevitable sequel will bring the free-roaming, open world game genre closer to the illusive 'free-formed, open-ended, sandbox' game like 'Oblivion' and 'Fallout 3'.  Overall, this is the biggest surprise of the year 2009 and a game no PS3 owner should miss.

*Free-roaming, open world game - You freely traverse an open and continous environment to take on mission to mission instead of being confined in the traditional closed and linear level to progress.  There are extra activities available when not restricted by main quest.

GTA series, Jak and Daxter series, Mafia series, The Godfather series, Scarface: The world is yours, True Crime, etc.

*Free-formed, open-ended game - You shape the storyline of game in any order to do whatever you want whenever you want however you want.

3186,5.0,"This is an EXCELLENT game that takes the galaxy civilization games a clear step further. Open-ended like a new science-fiction world and played as a seat-of-your-pants RTS game, this is a very intelligent hybrid that I greatly enjoyed.

In effect, SINS is a successful blend of the wonderful GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS and HOMEWORLD series, with a sprinkling of TOTAL WAR for good measure. This is NOT a turn-based civilization game, so expect a much faster pace. What this means is that while it maintains the characteristics of classic turn-based civilization games (exploration, expansion, exploitation and extermination), by relieving from the micromanagement tedium, it allows for an intense RealTime Strategy experience. Now, this probably may not appeal to turn-based purists, but I would advise an open mind: this is a good game.

This concept-blending is new, so expect a slow learning curve - it took me a number of ...false-starts to get the hang of it: after all, it plays like an RTS and (although simplified) it still has enough of turn-based features that need to be taken care of. The interface is simplified and informative at the same time, with info trees sliding out only when needed.

There are three different factions to choose from (financiers, technologists and psitecs) - yet, their differences focus mainly on research tree-branching and ship designs. What I did not like was that the ships of all three factions are effectively the same and their differences are only skin-deep. What I would have liked to find (and was disappointed to the point of withholding the 5th star for fun) was ship design and building! Remember how much fun was to design our own spaceships (from freighters to battleships) in GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS II? Well, no such luck here. Let's hope they keep it in mind when the patch gets prepared.

Quick and constant exploration is not only encouraged by a necessity if one wants to survive - let alone win. Spaceships built within a solar system cannot travel beyond it, unless using ""wormhole""-like singularities. This adds to realism but can stretch your finances to their breaking point - since only locally built ships can be used. Moreover, it makes really hard to locate the strategic points to either built defenses or focus an attack. The AI will constantly be bypassing your planning like the Maginot line - and leave you with such a French feeling...

The graphics (of all of backgrounds, planets and units) are very nicely done. I really liked the multiple afterburners tracing through space as a spaceship squadron was dopplering past my screen...And less-than-cutting-edge PC owners rejoice: even 4-5 years old systems can handle this game like a breeze!
What I truly appreciated was the realistic scale of things. Galaxies are much larger than star systems, which in turn are much larger than planets, which in turn are much larger than space stations...than spaceships and so on. How is this achieved? Excellent zooming!
SUPREME COMMANDER was the first game to introduce strategic zoom; however, SINS implements it much better and shows how it should had been done: from a galaxy to a single planet and to a single spaceship, zooming in or out firmly maintains the effectiveness of battle controls by grouping and simplifying the info-tiles as one zooms out. In SupCom, we had to chose between either discerning the units or moving ...info-tiles around the battlefield - not a bad first attempt, mind you. In SINS, one almost never looses perspective: ongoing battles, critical hotspots, or colony revolts are all easily identifiable in real-time.

On another note, SINS OF A SOLAR EMPIRE is a STARDOCK release which, yes, means their specialized installation utility. Nevertheless, this game hides no DRM or other intrusive security idiocy. Since trust and respect between a game publisher and its customers is a two-way street (and STARDOCK was willing to prove its friendship first), SINS deserves our support.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",0.07748416865944038

There are so many great things about this game...

in a nutshell...

ITS A FUN SHOOTER! The gameplay is great and it's nicely balanced. At 1st i thought that the game was set way to easy, but towards the last-last part of the game, it got more challenging. Now that i beat it, i will definately go back on a harder mode and enjoy it the game with another skin, difficulty level and more weapons!

TONS AND TONS OF FUN COOL WEAPONS!

Even though the Six Axis had a little part in it, it worked great and i'm glad they didn't over do it.

GRAPHICS ARE OUTSTANDING! The levels are pretty big and the level designs is awesome! Heavenly Sword and Resistance really stood out when it came to graphics... and now this game will join it too.

The game is CLEAN... meaning... no game is BUG FREE, but they did a great job and i found no major BUGS in the game.

The story was a blur at 1st, but became very interesting and left us hanging at the end for more because of a certain situation...

3195,5.0,"I am ashamed to admit.. I had heard very little of the Witcher until the Witcher 3 trailers popped up. I owned the first two, having bought them on a sale, but I hadn't really played them. Watching Geralt slaughter the three men that were torturing the girl in the trailer was just about the coolest thing I had ever seen, so I had to get into the game. I gave played through the first one and am partially through the second one, and The Witcher is now in my top ten games. Is it without its flaws? Well of course not, but what game isn't? I'll try to review each aspect of the game without being redundant to the other reviews that have been posted.

Environment and characters: Being that I played the game for the first time in 2013, the graphics weren't all that great. But, considering that the game was made in 2007 and the size of the game? Then it gets a little more impressive. The environments were actually really good, the character models themselves were good. They did use the same character model for multiple people (i.e., the merchants looked the same in every town, most of the harlots looked the same, barmaids in each inn looked the same, etc.), but again, you have to take it with a grain of salt. The game is six and a half years old :) The faces didn't have much expression to them, which was a little hard to get by for me, but if you can get past it it makes the game a lot more enjoyable, which I'll touch on later.

Sound: The music was a little bland, and the dialogue is good, but a tad lifeless. Like I said the faces were a bit emotionless, the dialogue was too in the sense that there wasn't much voice inflection. Geralt had the same tone of voice when he was seducing a woman, or telling a member of Salamandra that he was about to kill him. But as I stated before, if you can get past it the game becomes much more enjoyable.

Story: The story is actually really good. Aside from the semi-lifeless characters and voices, the story is really in depth. I love the decision making, how nothing is black and white, but gray. I had to pause and think for a minute more than once before picking a dialogue option that would seriously alter the game. For me personally, the game was a bit slow starting, which is weird considering that the first playable sequence of the game is defending Kaer Morhen. I don't really understand why it was to me, but hey, I'm a weirdie! ^_^ When you get inside of Vizima is when the game started to pick up to me, and when I started getting more involved.

Combat: A lot of people didn't care for the combat system, but I actually loved it. You had three ""stances"" if you will, your power attacks, fast attacks, and group attacks. The group attacks were most useful in my opinion, you could take out 3 or 4 guys that are attacking you all at once. The signs were pretty cool, I didn't really use them all that much unless I was getting raped by a few guys that were really tough, then I would light them up with Igni to help do some damage. But other than that, I think they could have been a little more involved.

Leveling and alchemy system: I loved the leveling system, to me it was incredible unique. Each aspect of Geralt's arsenal could be upgraded, and each skill to level up had a skill tree. The skill tree consisted of bronze, silver, and gold skills that would only be leveled up with bronze, silver, and gold talents (skill points). You couldn't level up a silver skill until you had leveled the appropriate bronze skill, and the same for silver and gold. It was a little overwhelming at first, because there was so much you could level up, but as you progressed in the game you knew what you wanted to level and what you didnt. The alchemy system took me a little bit to figure out, but once I figured it out I really enjoyed that as well. Basically as you fight around Temeria, you'll pass herbs, or as you kill enemies they'll drop alchemical ingredients. Each of these ingredients has a color in the corner of its picture. The different colors signified different alchemial components. Then, once you find recipes for potions, each potions would take a certain amount of certain colors (i.e. two green ingredients and one blue, or three white, one orange, and one blue). Potions also required a base, usually a strong alcohol. I didn't do much with blade coatings, I never really needed to, but it worked much the same way. I thought it was very innovative, especially for 2007.

One thing that I didn't care for (and that I spent a ton of time on the Witcher Wiki because of) was that whenever you found a witcher contract to go slay a certain amount of beasts, you had to have an entry in your Bestiary for that creature. Your bestiary is basically the monster section of your journal. If you didn't have that monster in your bestiary, you had to go find something to give you the entry, generally reading a book about that creature. It gave you no tips on how to find that specific book, so it involved a lot of time looking through basically every general merchant's books to find it. It was also very vague on where to actually find the specific monsters, but it wasn't too bad considering you could just google it ;)

All in all this game was fantastic. Easily one of my new favorite games of all time. It's a little slow starting, but if you can take the game with a grain of salt and get past the fact that it is an old game, you will have the time of your life. Anyone who doesn't like the game is lying ;) hahaha just kidding. But it is definitely worth the money! I have no regrets. Except for buying it on the GameStop client... Ugh I wish I could have gotten it on steam. But that was a derp on my part hahahaha.",0.013951027466544154

3208,5.0,"Most of Mario's games follow the same pattern. Bowser kidnaps poor Princess Peach, and then you collect stars until you've got enough to get to the final level. It's not I don't like that formula, but Mario Sunshine put such a unique twist on it. The game opens with Mario, Peach, and a bunch of Toads flying to a tropical island. A tour guide video comes on and IN FULL VOICEOVER says ""Welcome to the sun drenched tropical paradise of Isle Delfino! We are pleased to welcome you to our beautiful home!"" Once Mario lands it turns out that Bowser's son put on a Mario disquise and covered the island in pollution. The real Mario gets thrown in jail and is tasked with cleaning up the island. I liked the intro way better then ""Dear Mario, I baked a cake for you"". The gameplay was just as different as the opening. It still had the open world style that Mario 64 had, but it was often more focused. Normally you spray all of the gunk in your path with your handy dandy water hose, but a lot of the levels also had more puzzle elements. To knock over the giant Wiggler caterpillar you had to spray these weeds that shot a patch of land into the sky. Some levels had a platforming area where you had to just get to the end of the level. Super Mario Sunshine has a ton of variety with a beautiful beach theme. It was a nice change of pace. If you want an innovative Mario 64 sequel though, get Super Mario Galaxy. Super Mario Sunshine is a completely different idea, but it is a very fun game.",0.07185887671998782

I'll leave them behind and grapple to a heli, grapple the passenger to his falling death next with the pilot and then take it over and then blow the hell out of a thug-run criminal gas station with my heli's built in rockets, parachute down and then motorcycle to a drug king pen's villa and blow the snot out of him and his goons and its not even 6:00am in the morning yet. Am I a Marine? Nope, I don't command that respect but I play Just Cause 2. Been playing it for addictively for 16 hours now and not even 8% through the main game yet. Here is the original review - a few gripes after.

Well, I've never really enjoyed ""sandbox"" games. Tried GTA and just didn't get into it. Maybe I didn't try it long enough. But this game just got started and its an absolute blast and I think its just going to get even better. Watched many videos and read some reviews and watched one of the developers play and man this game is just plain insane fun! The diverse things you get to do and blow up are just amazing. Creating chaos and destroying cities to piss off the government! If only! Well, here we get to do it and the light story motivates you to kick some tail. The controls take time to get used to and are a bit difficult for older gamers like me, but its so much fun its worth it. Glitches??? I'm having way too much fun to even notice, nor do I give a .... Man, grappling to a huge heli, blowing it up OR taking it over then latching on to a building and 'chuting down, so many options. For less talented gamers such as myself, it does get a bit difficult with all of the controls and fast action though. I'll just have to keep practicing. As far as value for a game? I can't imagine how long and how many great hours you could put into this game. I think there are almost 400 locations to explore and infiltrate and I'm just getting started and thats not even mentioning the side missions which I haven't reached yet. Fun factor and replayability give this game 9.5 out of 10(haven't found a 10 yet) if you like to blow stuff up, shoot thugs, drive vehicles - planes, boats, helis, hummers and who knows what else.....this game is absolutely for you. If you pick apart games for reality, well give this one a pass. Once I get way further into it, I'll update this review.

Some gripes: Save points! I wish there was an option to go exactly back to the place where you died. It seems that the game sticks you back into an old conquest and you have to fly/ride/run back to the other place or ""transport"" from your black market contact to a previous conquest that is close by to where you want to be. Not sure why, but thats the way they did it. Maybe there is another way but I don't know it. The vehicles can be difficult at first, but after you get used to them they are a complete blast. This game is still one of the most fun games I have ever played and there is so much more. Its one of the first games the I want to complete each mission at 100% and that can be fairly time consuming. The heli's are so much fun. I don't know why the put the vehicle purchase option in the game when you can just steal and aquire them in the game. Maybe there is a reason, but I don't know it yet. I bought a couple but it was just a waste of cash when I crashed them and stole another. I'll stand by my 5 star and 9.5 out of 10 review, or ok, 9.25 out of 10. A complete consuming blast, and still I'm only a small way in the game.",-0.016624779933726387

Like many of you video game frantics out there you have been praying, begging and hoping that someday, out of the blue someone will bring to you a thing that will allow you to make your own games.  Well fellow believers the time has come.  RPG maker is here!  There is much rejoicing and much pain and suffering.
Let me say this right off the bat.  You will need a lot of time to make a game with RPG maker.  That means you will nead about 1-2 months if you hope to create a game.  But that does not involve the time neaded to understand how to use this thing.  From the minute you boot it up.  You will scratch your head raw in a effort to understand how to use RPG Maker.  I spent who knows how many hours trying to figure out how to make levels, make spells,items etc.  At one point I was so deppressed I gave up and did another game.
But wait...
1 month after I got RPG Maker I Botted it up again and gave it another go.  And low and behold, somehow everything fit togeather! At long last I finially understood everything, ""so that s how the event thingy works, so thats how the monster edit goes!"" were thoughts that flashed through my mind.  I set to work making my very first game, Quest for Atlantis.  1 1/2 months later I finially finished it.  It took aproximatly 2 hours per day, for 1 1/2 months to make a 1 hour game.  But it has been worth it.  It is impossible, to say in words, the thrill you get when you finially play your finished game for the first time.  A game that YOU made.  Music, levels, charachters were all made by YOU.  I have also a tidbit of advice for you.  DONT LOSE THE 2 MANUALS!! they will prove invaluble in the future.  But they cant be good all the time.  For instance I was trying to find a ship, one that I had made in the items section and I couldent find it.  The manual only said when the logo for it was displayed.  I finially found it by going to sample dungeon and going under ""Other"" but I am still trying to find the blimp.  Where are you you stupid Blimp?  Also forget about using the animie maker.  Its impossible to use.  RPG Maker is incredibly frustrating at first, But goes above and beyond the call of duty to reward those who stick with it.
The good: you can make your own games! need I say more?  Infinate replay value
the bad: hard to use.  Manuals can be superficial
And the ugly: Incredibly hard to get the hang of.",-0.012530323943367422

I couldn't use it for an excuse as my husband raised his eyebrows at me when he learned of the purchase. The truth is I was dying to try this one for myself. The setup is pretty easy. You choose your character for your profile, head to pick out uniforms and poms, then you're off to practice. After an easy but informative tutorial, you hit the floor cheering. Head to the workout area to do simple to complex routines meant to burn calories as you train out of shape participants. They reward you with goodies like new uniforms. Or head to the cheer competition featuring several cute locations and familiar FUN songs. Each location offers four songs/routines varying in difficulty. Pick them off by scoring points, thus filling your rainbow megaphone. Master them, and you earn a new location with new songs. I must warn you, this is embarrassingly addictive. Also be warned, it takes a while to get into the groove and get the feel of the tracers, as well as how to hold the wii-motes. It feels strange at first to use the two wii-motes, but you'll get the hang of it no time. My boys have played, and they really love it. My 5 year old even beat me on the Corbin Bleu ""Push It"" song. :-) I like the upper body workout, and am even starting to add some footwork to it. You should know that you are literally thrown into each routine without being taught it first. It takes several times to get an idea for what the routine is like. Then it becomes very enjoyable.

3228,5.0,"""7 button"" is a little deceptive, especially for the gamers. Though mentioned in the description, the standard left and right keys, in addition to the scroll wheel and the DPI control is included in the buttons count. But this point is inconsequential when taking into account the sheer value of this mouse.
This mouse, which may actually be the cheapest one available on Amazon, is of very good value. The two side keys do the usual back and forward commands while the additional strange key next to the left key is a sort of an ""auto double click"" where a single click yields a double click response. The DPI, as stated, is variable in fixed intervals, and actually makes significant differences between them.

The build quality of the mouse is surprisingly high. It uses a soft rubber finish with a shiny plastic accent that makes it quite pleasing to look at. When plugged in, it has a breathing color effect, fades in and out of different colors.
The mouse lacks the heft that premium gaming mice come with, but feels sturdy. The braided cable was a nice touch.

Very enjoyable. It's not buggy like Luxor:Quest For The Afterlife (see my review).
Luxor 3 is a bubble shooter game mixing together elements of marble popper, puzzle, and shooter games. I have played 3 other Luxor games, and this is the best one!
Graphics and music are very good. Music for the puzzle section I wish they sold because it is absolutely wonderful!
There are achievements to earn and puzzles to make you think. Some of the mazes are difficult and require lots of repeat plays. If you have played Luxor:Quest, none of the Luxor 3 mazes are as bloody difficult as the boat rope maze in Quest. I almost gave up playing Quest because of the boat rope maze. I finally succeeded after hours (and hours and...)!!!
Play the puzzle section over and over to earn more ankhs for your power-ups and for the cool sci-fi shooter.

You have ranks to achieve. So I've been playing the free play section over and over and over to earn points to achieve new ranks. I read there are 70 ranks. The ranks are not numbered.
Here are all the ranks I've achieved since I started writing them down at Protector Of The People:

Life Of The Land
Servant Of The Celestial
Embodiment Of The Divine
Propagator Of Life
Keeper Of Being
Thinker Of Pure Thoughts
Possessor Of Courage
Opposer Of Wickedness
Interrogator Of Memories
Walker Of The True Path
Judge Of Spirits
Protector Of The Body
Guardian Of The Tomb
Guide Of Spirits
Weigher Of The Heart
Haunter Of The Wicked (I like that one a lot!)
Sentinel Of The Necropolis
Gatekeeper Of The Afterlife
Speaker Of Truth
Guardian Of Secrets
Diviner Of Knowledge
Upholder Of Truth
Preserver Of Learning
Heeder Of Wisdom
Guardian Of Truth
Conscript Of The Gods
Soldier Of Order
Enforcer Of Law

It seems the more ranks you achieve the longer it takes to achieve them! Between the ranks Soldier Of Order and Enforcer Of Law, I had to earn about 20 million points. If I average 500,000 points per maze, I have to play about 40 of them. That's too many (because I DO have a life) SO I will never know what the last rank is. I have googled the ranks several times. I find nothing that states the higher ranks. If anybody knows, send me a message.
Luxor 3 is still my favorite Luxor!

Sonic 2 for Game Gear is not what you expect to be if you had played the Genesis version: It has a completely different storyline and zones. Tails is kidnapped by Robotnik and Sonic must save him. Isn't Tails supposed to be the sidekick?

Anyways, the gameplay is identical to the Genesis games, which is great. The music and sounds were still well-developed. What is kind of a letdown is that there are no Special Stages. You gotta find the Chaos Emeralds in the zones themselves. There's your challenge for ya.

If they pull off the basics of the games foundations, who cares if its running state of the art graphics or sound or not.  Point is on a game is balanced playability.

3246,5.0,"Three eras, two hedgehogs, one epic adventure! That was the slogan for what would become possibly the best Sonic game since Sonic Adventure 2 for the Sega Dreamcast. This is the WhitWire review for Sonic Generations for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 (also given a handheld version on the Nintendo 3DS).

Since the blue blur's introduction to 3D-styled gameplay, opinions on the quality of his games have been mixed between the two halves of his fan-base. Modern Sonic games have been criticized over and over again for having too many scripted scenes, implementing bad cameras, causing motion sickness, and shoving unnecessary gimmicks down our throats.

With the debut of Sonic Generations, the fans' attention was immediately drawn to one fact: now you could play as either ""classic"" Sonic or ""modern"" Sonic as you progress. Sonic Generations was Sega's attempt to celebrate 20 years of their beloved mascot--but does it live up to expectations?

It isn't until you finish the very first level of the game as Classic Sonic when you're introduced to some story elements. The basic plot of Sonic Generations is that a mysterious time-travelling creature has captured the Sonics and their friends and sucked the ""color and life"" out of the surrounding world--all with the aim to stop time itself.

Through the game's progress, you will save Sonic's friends--who have been eaten by this creature and set into alternate dimensions. Playing as Modern Sonic, you'll save your fox-friend Tails. Tails--who is just as perplexed about this strange world as Sonic is. After this, the hubworld given to you expands, you can decide whether to play as Modern Sonic or Classic Sonic, and you'll now have to zip your way through four more levels before Classic and Modern Sonic finally meet up.

Upon discovering that there are two Sonics, the game's storyline goes through a very simple formula: save your friends and stop the evil that threatens to tear the world apart.

As Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, it's up to you to run through this world--which comes in the form of various levels--to bring them back to life. All these levels are based on past levels from the all the Sonic games created in the past 20 years. Each of these levels are set up into groups of three--referred to as ""eras"".

There are three eras: Classic, Dreamcast, and Modern. The Classic era consists of Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone, and Sky Sanctuary. The Dreamcast era's levels are Speed Highway, City Escape, and Seaside Hill. Finally there's the Modern era--which is made up of Crisis City, Rooftop Run, and Planet Wisp.

Both Classic and Modern Sonic will have to run through the levels in these eras. Every time the Sonics run through these levels, they travel through time and space. As a result, they restore color and life to the universe.
It isn't until the end where a ""certain someone"" and his ""friend"" show up and admit to having caused all the havoc in the Sonics' world. Who are these people I speak of? I don't know, guys; I probably shouldn't spoil it for you!
All this being said, the story of this game--especially for an anniversary title--is incredibly simple but manages to tie in well with the actual gameplay.

If there's one thing I think many of today's Sonic games lack in, it's variety. In the past, however, games like Sonic Adventure were criticized for having too many characters to play as--half of which were completely boring in the eyes of many fans. Despite everything I've just said, Sonic Generations gives an equal balance of diversity among levels.

People who played Sonic's titles on the Sega Genesis will feel immediately at home with Classic Sonic. He's everything you'd think he would be; he has the old, stout, beady-eyed look, old side-scrolling gameplay, and same means of reaching the end of levels.

Classic Sonic plays identically to how he played in the Genesis days--with a few exceptions. The first difference you'll notice about Classic Sonic is the power in his spindash. In the old days, if you really wanted to make a powerful spindash, you'd have to press down on the D-pad and constantly mash the jump button. In Generations, however, you get all the power by only pressing the spindash button--and and nothing else but the spindash button--once. Once you decide Sonic is done revving up in place, you can let go of the spindash button and cause him to skyrocket across the screen--bouncing on enemies all the while.

One of the major downsides to Classic Sonic--a feature that will become immediately apparent to anybody who has played the Genesis titles--is his inability to gain momentum while going down slopes. Rather than going down slopes, you'll be expected to mash the spindash button often.

Modern Sonic plays exactly like he did in Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors. This being said, Modern Sonic comes equipped with the Sonic boost and the homing attack--all in a 3D environment.

The Sonic boost serves as a means of speeding Sonic up. While using the boost, all enemies in your path will be killed simply by you running into them. The homing attack will serve as a means to launch Sonic at enemies and other obstacles while he's in midair. I highly recommend you use this attack if you find bouncing on your enemies in a 3D world to be tedious.

A big downside to modern Sonic is his controls--which are incredibly stiff without the drifting and side-stepping introduced from Sonic Unleashed. Such stiffness makes me yearn for the controls given to him in the Sonic Adventure games.

Apart from the two Sonics, Sonic Generations gives us a very close attention to detail--so close that the game is sure to make it very hard to catch all the detail all at once on your first run-through. I must admit that even I know I haven't seen all the details and alternate paths to take. The largeness of these worlds makes these possibly the largest Sonic levels since Sonic the Hedgehog 3's acts.

Sonic Generations adds many minigames--all of which are based on the actual game levels--to help add to the largeness of the game. The actual replay value of these minigames can range from, ""Sure; let's give it a go,"" to, ""No! No; not this part again! Anything but that!"" In my opinion, the best levels are the ones where you race to the finish line against another Sonic. If you manage to beat all the levels in a particular area, all the color will be restored to that area based on the level it surrounds.

Although Sonic is mainly known for his mind-blowing speed, there are plenty of platforming sections you'll have to go through in order to progress. I honestly think it's safe to say that this game has a perfect balance between speed and platforming.

Added to this, you'll also be encouraged to search for red medallions--medals that earn you art and music. While I don't care much for the artwork, you can actually play the music pieces during actual gameplay. All these music tracks are, of course, tracks from almost every Sonic game ever made.

If there's one thing in this game many die-hard Sonic fans will complain about, it's the Skill Shop. It is here where a small, blue robot named Omochao will sell you ""skills"" to use in the game. Some skills include the elemental (electric, bubble, and fire) shields for Classic Sonic and the Direct Jump for Modern Sonic. If you want to ""equip"" these skills, you have to put them into a ""skill set"".

There are only 5 ""skill sets"" and you can only hold one at a time. Added to this, the amount of skills you put in your sets is limited depending on how effective the skills are to your performance. Why might people like this system, you may ask?

Notorious games such as Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) and (notorious for some people) Sonic Unleashed used skill shops. Many people will argue that all of Sonic's non-game-breaking abilities should be available from the get-go--and I agree.

If ever in the game you're having serious (and I mean SERIOUS) problems trying to figure out how to play the game, you have the option to activate the Omochao: who will tell you exactly how to play the game.
Once activated, you can run into the Omochao anytime during the game. Omochao is slightly hard to avoid, and no matter how fast you run, Omochao will still be able to catch up and tell you every little detail concerning gameplay. For people who have never played a Sonic game before, I recommend you keep this feature on. For those who are already familiar with the series' mechanics, turning on the Omochao is sure to annoy you.

Sonic Generations may have problems, but thankfully they are very few and small. Like I said before, the story of this game is incredibly simple and--I must add--slightly underwhelming. Although the story and the Skill Shop may catch people off-guard, Sonic Generations manages to bring the perfect balance between speed and platforming we've all come to know and love.",0.019531008247903207

3257,5.0,"Smackdown vs Raw (2007) doesn't only control better than any other version but it has tournerments when the other versions don't. I think the tournerments are fun too and a nice addition to the game. You have King of the Ring, The Road to WM, Smackdown vs Raw tournerment and a Money in the Bank Tournerment. When ever I play the game for other systems now I always miss the tournerment option that the PSP version has. Plus as far as graphics go, this game looks awesome for a portable game. I don't like how it controls different for other systems now but this version is the easiest to control. I strongly recommend this game. Smackdown vs Raw 2006 is also a really good for PSP game but this one is surprisingly much better.

  I think the legend thing should be different for the next. Like if you want Eddie Guerrero you have to play as a Smackdown wrestler in season mode. Plus I think you should be able to unlock legend matches like a body bag match that the Undertaker used to have in the early 90's. I think you should have to unlock ECW Legends as well. Like if you want Bam Bam Bigelow or Terry Funk ""or the late great Mike Awesome"" you play as an ECW wrestler. I think they should also have women Legends to unlock in the next game as well like Trish, Lita and Chyna.

  Legends for Smackdown 2008 I'd wanna see: Hogan, Bret Hart, Stone Cold, The Rock, Rick Rude, Randy Savage, Jake the Snake ""and after u beat someone he should put the snake on them"", The Million Dollar Man, Chris Jericho ""he deserves respect!"", Mr. Perfect, Owen Hart, The British Bulldogs ""Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid"", Jim Neidhart, Ricky Steamboat, Razor Ramon, Diesel, The Demolition, Yokozuna, Vader, The Ultimate Warrior, Bam Bam Bigelow ""with his ECW or WWE ring music"", Marty Jannety, Shane and Vince McMahon, Terry Funk, Lita, JBL, Chyna, Trish Stratus and Arn Anderson. I also wouldn't mind cruiserweight legends for once like Dean Malenko, The Ultimo Dragon...

3261,5.0,"Without a doubt, the characters in this game are the most realistic. Whoever writes that they are too cheesy or corny has not lived in the real word (even though I'm solitary and introverted, I was able to realize that). The way Square made each character's behaviour was enough to make me love the game, though the graphics weren't my favorite. As these chars are teenagers, NOT adults, the way that they act is completely natural for people whose method of emotions has not evolved into that of an adult (duh). The whole prodigy thing was a bit much, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the game.
Also, the distinction of behaviour between the adults and the children and teenagers is superb. Square really put a lot of emotional study into this game, and it shows. The characters in this game are the most human I have seen for a long time. Also, the originality of the plot must be why many people hate it; they want the same old (hint on OLD) characters that have ALWAYS appeared in FF titles, the plot to be the same, and the characters to all be dragoons or black mages. Sorry to burst your bubble, but this game is ORIGINAL (aside from its title). It breaks away, it is unorthodox, but that is quite all right when you look at the alternative (FFIX, which is basically a universal plot with no real good original ideas, and Square 'made up' for it with cramming tons of stuff from the other 8 games into the scene...it sucked). My opinion? Buy it, every penny is worth it. Unless you don't like originality.

3268,5.0,"When the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in late 1985 to much critical acclaim, Kid Icarus was one of the first games to grace everyone's homes.  Your hero, Pit, is responsible for taking down the evil Medusa.  But in order to do so, he must progress through 4 worlds:  the Underworld, the Overworld, the Skyworld, and the Palace In The Sky.  Each world is divided into 4 sections (with the exception of the Palace In The Sky).

As you begin the game in the vertical-scrolling Underworld, Pit will need to explore every open door with the many surprises that await him.  There's the Enemy Room, the Treasure Room (you can earn a credit card if you shoot all of the treasure bags that don't contain the Reaper), the Training Room (this allows Pit to acquire 3 special weapons:  the Fire Arrow, the Holly Bow, and the duo Protective Crystals), 2 different Shopkeeper's Rooms (you can purchase the Hammer, Water Of Life, Barrel, Glass Of Wine, or Angel Wing), the God's Room (he'll upgrade your Arrow if you've killed enough enemies), and the Hot Springs room (which can refill Pit's Life Meter).  Furthermore, the more points that you rack up at the end of every level, the sooner that Pit's life bar will expand (to a maximum of 5).

By the time that you reach Stage 1-4, you will encounter many moore booby traps, and you will need to acquire the Check Sheet (or Map), Pencil and Torch to make it through to the boss.  But watch out for the Eggplant Wizard -- he'll turn Pit into an eggplant, and he'll need the Hospital's help to become normal again!  After you defeat a particular boss, Pit will acquire one of the three Sacred Treasures.

As you further progress through the horizontal-scrolling Overworld and the vertical-scrolling Skyworld, the challenge will become easier because Pit will be able to use his 3 special weapons.  After clearing the third boss in Stage 3-4, Pit will also be able to use all 3 of the Sacred Treasures:  the Pegasus Wing, Mirror Shield, and Light Arrow!

In the final stage (Palace In The Sky), Pit will progress through an auto-horizontal side-scroller before finally reaching Medusa.  She, herself, isn't very difficult to defeat.  All you have to do is station Pit at the left middle side of the screen while she fires in a downward angle.  But watch out for her snakes!  Kid Icarus has some of the best graphics and very deep soundtrack in the action genre, alongside Super Mario Bros., Metroid and The Legend Of Zelda.  So if you haven't downloaded the 3D version of this title onto your Nintendo 3DS, well then you'd better stop reading this already and start playing!  :)",0.024884099388743353

If you are looking for more content among the second generation, give Crystal a try (I should mention that one cannot compare the two, however, as Crystal was an entire remake of the generation).",0.02314814814814815
3314,5.0,"I've been using this game for almost four months now and have completed 60 workouts.  (...)

As I'm always looking for something to inspire me to exercise it didn't take me long to come across this little gem. Yourself! Fitness is an Xbox ""game"" geared towards physical fitness. You are introduced to Maya who will be your personal trainer.

Maya starts you off by having you do a physical assessment where you are taken through a series of exercises and your resting and elevated heart rates are measured. You put in your height, weight and sex and from there Maya will customize a workout plan for you. Based on what your results are Maya will recommend a goal for you such as Weight Loss, cardio and other selections.

If you own hand weights, a balance ball or stepper, Maya can also incorporate those into your workout as well but you don't need to have those things to do it.

Y!F lets you set up a calendar to record when you want to exercise and for how long each session. For your initial fitness evaluation, Maya will recommend to you a weekly schedule but you can customize that for yourself. For instance, Maya recommended weight loss for me and had me scheduled every other day for 15 minutes to start. I am very overweight and I think ""she"" didn't want me to overdo it in the beginning. But I thought I could handle more and I adjusted the calendar to add in some 30 minute workouts. I'm entering my third week of workouts and have been doing five to six workouts a week at 30 minutes each.

Each time you go to workout, you are greeted by Maya. Maya will ask you how you are feeling. You are giving three options for an answer. Paraphrasing here but here is an example: A. Nothing can stop me, B. Feeling okay today and C. You're lucky I'm here!

Now, based on your answer, Maya will set the intensity of the workout before you even start. As you are working out, Maya will again ask you how you are doing. You can than chose if you think the workout has been too hard or too easy and Maya will then adjust accordingly.

This is so much better than a dvd or video just for the above mentioned customization but there is also some more neat things. Like you can zoom the camera in and out and pan all around Maya to get a better look at how she is doing the exercises. There is also a tutorial that you can exit out of the workout and you get more detailed instructions on how to do the workout. When you are ready you can rejoin Maya! There are different work out settings and music to chose from so less chance of getting bored.

Each day, when you start your program, Maya will suggest a daily focus - Weight loss, Cardio, Upper body, Lower Body and Flexibility. She varies these so you aren't doing the same thing over and over again. Weight loss is my main goal but I do the other workouts too and they are geared more to help me lose weight. You have a warming up period in the beginning and then you do the targeted workout for the day and a few minutes of stretching near the end.

Y!F also has a ""Meditation Garden"". This is a ""place"" to go and do yoga exercises. I haven't tried this part out yet but others have really enjoyed it.

There is also a reward system. After you've completed three scheduled workouts, Maya will reward you with some bronze dumbbells, a new location and a new music choice. There are two more sets of dumbbells to earn after this and more locations and music to unlock.

The workouts use Yoga, Pilates, Cardio, Strength training, and flexibility exercises.

After a set amount of workouts, Maya will have you do another Physical Assessment to see how far you've progressed.

There is also a great support system at the Yourself! Fitness website where you can keep an open journal where other members can encourage you and you encourage them.

There isn't much negative I can say about this except maybe a better selection of music or music you can download into it would be nice.

The graphics for Maya are excellent! She looks almost like a real person and moves pretty realistically too. Sometimes her arms look a little funny or she seems to be floating a bit but other than that, she looks great. The background graphics could be a little better but maybe the next version will address that.

I own a ton of exercise videos, dvds and very expensive exercise equipment that I just don't use. I'm starting my third week with this and I feel almost addicted to the program. There's something about being greeted and asked how you are doing or being told you're doing a great job meeting your commitments. It also keeps you on your toes not knowing exactly what to expect because each workout is different. There are over 500 exercises and Maya usually adds one to two each workout.

There is also a meal plan for those who are looking for that sort of help. I haven't done the meal plan but folks on the Y!F website who have really like it. You can download recipes from the website that you will find on the game.

This also comes in a PC version and a Playstation 2 version as well.

I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a home fitness routine.

3317,5.0,"Great stealth game with an original story, engaging dialog, and dynamic characters",0.25
3318,5.0,"Talk about a game that came out of no where.  Dead Space was almost dead in the water.  The original game and concept was to be a prison ship where, to my understanding, you would be fighting prisoners while trying to escape.  After a script rewrite, as something thought a horror game would be better, we now have one of the best horror games of all time (in my opinion).

Gameplay: If you do not know what dead space is about instead of watching videos or spoiling the game by reading a faq / walkthrough , all you need to know is you are Isaac Clarke. An engineer sent with a bunch of people to fix a busted up comm's array on a ""planet cracker"" .  A ship designed to rip planets apart to salvage valuable resources.  Your landing goes.. a bit wrong lets just say and from that point on keep your door locked and the lights on.  This game specializes in jump scares and old school horror (like resident evil). Harder the difficulty, the more impossible the game feels.  The gameplay doesn't get old, as you collect schematics for new weapons, power nodes for upgrades(adding an RPG element), dual fire modes and actually rewards you for being a good aim or at least learning the weak spots on enemies.  The controls (for PS3 at least) are positioned well and allows you to make multiple actions w/o much effort.

Sound/Story: The sound is surreal.  Amazing... It does a perfect job of making you paranoid, scared and feel claustrophobic.  Voice acting is very good and believable.  The story is great!  On first playthrough you might find it has a few holes in it but do enough side exploring and find some hidden vids/text document files and those holes will be filled.  The storyline is pretty unique and you will feel like Isaac the entire time -- trying to put the pieces together to figure out just what happen on the Ishimura

Graphics/Presentation: The game looks great.  720p (1080p if you force it).  The levels are very creepy and set a scary, dark tone. You will traverse the Ishimura(spelling?) in an attempt to flee the nightmare you walked into.  Zero Gravity rooms, moving in the vacuum of space, tight corridors, rooms with no lights etc.  The game does a very good job of making every chapter feel like an entire new place despite being stuck on board the spaceship. Image wandering through a tight hall with the sole light flickering.. odd writing on the walls and a strange sound rattling in the rafters above that sound like footsteps.. makes you think something is watching you. Perhaps something is --

Length/Replay: You can get a good 8-10 hrs on EASY out of the game.  If you are good enough might be able to cut that down to 6-7hrs. Impossible will make you almost cry especially if you play it how the game intended (no DLC and only using the Plasma cutter).  By beating the game on any difficulty you unlock ""impossible"" which can be selected from the new game menu right after saving a game plus file (or you can load a game plus file then start a new game).  I've played through the game 4 times already.  While the scare factor is almost all but gone for me the gameplay keeps me coming back!

Summary of ""cons"" I have for this game (with positive re-enforcement)
- DLC tends to ruin the game.  Did an impossible run with the Tank suit and Heavy Dmg weapons.  Was not a lot of fun killing enemies in 2 hits.  [Best bet if you are going for a true experience, play the game on HARD with your first playthough and do a Plasma Pistol only run.  Can always then do an ""easy"" game and use that to unlock trophies/have fun.
- Not so much a con but well a mechanic flaw in the game.  Some 'ammo' is pre-set in the game. The rest is randomly chosen from what weapons you have available to use with priority given to what you have on your character [basically if you only have a plasma cutter 90% of the ammo in the game will be plasma rounds.  This leads to an insane surplus and takes away from the horror experience.  Equip 4 weapons so that you always have 'low' ammo.  Makes every shot count then.. but again.. this is OPTIONAL]

Overall Score: 98%
A must have for any Action / survival horror / sci-fi gamer.  This game came out of no where and was impressive on almost all levels.  There is a reason why it is a greatest hits(PS3) and a Platinum(Xbox360) title. I also proudly say that I have the PLATINUM trophy (PS3) for this game. A fun game to strive to platinum",0.025605399856949713
3319,5.0,"After an abnormally long wait and rumors that were flying about, Samus Aran finally returns, this time on the Gameboy Advanced in the game ""Metroid Fusion.""  All the original creators of the series are back to bring you the next chapter of the Metroid saga.
And boy, did they succeed.  What an involving game.  The storyline is pretty good (Samus getting infected by the X-Parasite and must destroy it while dealing with the parasite's fusion to her) and the graphics are actually outstanding.  It's not perfect, but they brought back the original style of ""Super Metroid.""  They also improved the wall jump.  The world map is a little more linear than Super Metroid, but so what?  It's good nonetheless.
Looking at the reviews on Amazon, I cannot believe how much Prime is regarded over this.  Fusion may not hold a candle to many of the classics, but considering today's video game market being dominated by ultra-cool graphics and cinema scenes, THIS GAME IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.  If anything, this proves that an old school game can survive in this day and age.  Gamers tend to forget the reason why games are awesome in the first place: GAMEPLAY.  This game has it.
If you have a Game Boy Advanced, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU PICK THIS UP.  This has classic written all over it and you should not be without this game, especially if you are a fan of the series.  This is a worthy sequel to Super Metroid.  So what are you waiting for?!",0.07789666473877001
3320,5.0,"Zone of the Enders is probably one of the most well-crafted games of its genre. Do you like giant robots? Do you like giant robots doing crazy, insane anime-esque fights? This collection lets you do that, by giving Z.O.E. 1 and 2 an HD reboot better suited for modern tvs than their original PS2 releases.

The controls are tight and well-executed, the updated graphics are simply gorgeous, the music is amazing, and the story is every bit as ridiculous and nonsensical as it's creators other works on the Metal Gear series.

This release also needs a bit of an history lesson for those purchasing for the first time. The original Zone of the Enders games contained a demo disk for the newest Metal Gear Solid. For a lot of Z.O.E. fans, they got into the series because they wanted the demo, and played the game because it looked fun. The fact that the HD collection contains a demo disk is simply a fan send-off from a creator that knows just -why- a lot of players got into Z.O.E.

This is a game that I will definitely come back to at some point to try out some of the other classes I didn't get to.  I think the only negative thing I can say about this game is the grinding nature of it... to complete the game just once, with one character build, you have to go through 4 chapters on 4 different difficulties (normal, nightmare, hell, and inferno).  The randomness of the game helps a bit with this, same areas potentially have different layouts every time you load and the various events and dungeons are also random.  But this randomness also means you may never see some areas... I've played through all 4 chapters at least 20 times now and still don't have all of the exploration challenges for Act 2.  On the plus side though, your stash can be shared between your characters so it does get easier each time you play through with a new character if you hang on to good armor and weapons.

3370,5.0,"There seems to be a curse on Ace Combat akin to that on the Star Trek movies. And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2...

If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed.

The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear ""Bingo!"" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself.

controls handle perfectly, this is by far the best Batman game ever made, you truly feel like batman, from the gadgets and fighting style to the detective aspect of the game, this game hits every note perfectly, for the first time ever in a game you are the batman.

graphics are fantastic, every little detail throughout arkham is rendered perfectly, everything from the smallest details in a room to the character models are crisp and well done.

the game is set in a semi-open world style, similar to Bioshock's levels. every area of Arkham Asylum, inside and out, can be explored eventually.

voice acting is spot on, with the original voice actors of Batman and the Joker from Batman: The Animated Series.

basically its the best game overall we've seen so far this year, and it will most likely go down as the best Batman game of all time.",0.026690782132959

3382,5.0,"UPDATE:4August2015:  After owning the Shield a few weeks now, I upgraded my opinion from 4 to a full 5 stars. Its become my home entertainment hub, with my usage leaning heavily on Kodi.  Kodi is now in the Android Play Store so installing it is a snap. Using the controller at first felt awkward navigating, but with use and familiarity, it's a snap, and the optional $50 remote really isn't necessary at all. I added a bluetooth keyboard to my setup; it was recognized immediately and works flawlessly with the shield. The headphone jack in the controller also works flawlessly for playing games or watching something late at night. I appreciate the solid construction of the controller more now also as I've dropped it on a hardwood floor numerous times without any damage whatsoever.  Still blazingly fast and using Netflix as well is still far superior to using it on my Roku or PS3.

The Invidia Shield Console serves a dual role. First and foremost it's a platform to play Android games as evidenced by having a game controller as it's interface. The controller is solid and hefty, fitting in the hand comfortably with a familiar layout of buttons and joysticks for anyone who's owned a PlayStation or Xbox.  There's a capacitive triangular area that turns on the controller with the touch of your finger. Beneath that area is a circle that when touched takes you back to the main menu area, also touch sensitive. Lower still is an area that allows you to adjust the sound volume, so everything is just a fingertip away and very convenient.  Once set up and initialized, that is you're greeted with a screen that gives suggestions of things that might interest you based on previous choices. Those might include Utube videos games and other items. Beneath that is a square that is the gateway to downloading games, both free and for sale.  Gaming was not my primary objective but I downloaded a free car racing game to ""kick the tires"" and found it surprisingly addictive.  The controller was comfortable and responsive.  My only frustration came with not having any idea how to use the controller, that is, what each button accomplished and so navigating the controls was hit or miss until it eventually became evident. The gamers out there might be rolling their eyes, but this was annoying for someone used to a PS3 controller. Any game I played on my PS3 walked you through how the controls worked for that game and gradually gave you more complex tasks until you got the lay of the land. This lacked that luxury or at least made the understanding more obtuse.

The other function the console serves, which was it's intended purpose for me, was to serve as as the hub of an entertainment center, i.e., accessing Netflix, having access to a browser, and hugely important was being able to access Kodi, (XBMC).  Out of the box the Shield sadly did none of those things and trying to initialize those uses proved head-bangingly frustrating.  Even going to the download store just didn't let any of that happen. I would go through the download process but the app was nowhere to be found.  Thankfully an update was issued and there in the menu appeared Netflix.  Since no browser was included either, I needed to download Kodi to my laptop, transfer it to  a memory card, then insert it into the Shield console.  Before you can even access that you first need to download ES File Explorer. For some reason that was also a frustrating process but finally was accomplished and Kodi was installed and set up.  If you also intend to use Kodi, it might be noted that when you want to search for a show or movie the title, of course, it must be typed in. Using the game controller for that purpose was again, less than ideal.  Fortunately, I had a bluetooth keyboard that works with android which coupled effortlessly and made any typing extremely easy.  Once set up, Kodi now enjoys it's own icon in the main interface menu and so is easily accessed.  Two weeks after receiving the Shield Console I read that Opera released a browser that worked. Finally, all the pieces are coming together!  Since the controller contains a microphone, I was able to bypass using the keyboard completely in doing searches, and it works almost perfectly!  Now, I must say that the Shield has gone beyond my expectations.  Picture quality is nothing short of terrific.  Speed of all functions including accessing Netflix is supersonic, far faster than my Roku.  My only other gripe was that the sound was limited to Dolby, but with whatever upgrades they made I can now use the other multi speaker variations of my sound system.  Most of my initial disappointment and frustration was due to the Shield being really incomplete on unboxing.  The software upgrades, the available browser and Netflix fixes ironed out the glitches.  A few words about the unit itself. Like other's have mentioned, it feels extremely solid and even the packaging exudes quality. The geometric almost architectural design is impressive and futuristic.  The thin slice of green light that signals the unit is on is brilliant and almost alien. It sits solidly flat but there's an available solid aluminum stand/base that's available that holds the unit vertically and for me was a must have because it deserves to be featured and seen.  There's a remote control that's also available for an additional fifty dollars which I haven't seen but it's received highest marks from reviewers for it's feel and the quality of it's build.  Undecided whether I'll spring for that.  In summary, the Shield Console is exactly what I wanted as an entertainment hub and I can't praise it highly enough, plus it has the added benefit of being a gaming console, which may be it's main intended function, but for me will be an added bonus.  Why only 4 stars then?  Mainly because of the initial experience of not being complete out of the box with the software included that most people wanted, notably Netflix, as well at the need to jump through hoops to discover how to complete all that was needed and then to install it manually. Not sure if you can use the Opera browser to download and install Kodi, but I don't see why you couldn't now.  Also, ES File Explorer or something similar should have been included in the initial package.  Also, though the unit is brilliant, at this price point, it seems excessive that to have the stand and remote you'll need to shell out another eighty dollars which seems excessive for something that should have been included initially or available for a more reasonable price.  Getting past those initial trials and annoyances I can whole heartedly recommend this unit whether you're looking for a gaming experience or now, to use as the hub of your entertainment system. Slightly pricey, and not exactly the plug and play ease of say, a Roku box, but once set up you'll be blown away with it's speed and the options it offers you. It's a work in progress, but I expect it will only continue to be refined and the bar of superlatives raised.",0.032450668794696456

But mario kart super circuit is one of the best games i have ever played. Its very creative and i really like the gameplay. The idea for the game was really fun, and addicting. The charecters are all great and they all race differently. The music on this game was awesome, they had a different tune for every track! The best thing about the game is that its challenging, there are so mamy tracks to beat(once you unlock the secret ones) i still haven't finished the game and i've had it for over six months. But thats okay because it keeps me playing, and it never gets old. I think the game is well worth 30 dollars even if it is from 2001. Overall this game was definately a keeper!

Pros:

great gameplay

fun charecters

40 different tracks

items make game very fun

music is great

graphics are superb

single player or multi player

battles for multi player

addicting

challenging

The buttons respond similar to Hori's Kuro buttons. The joystick feels similar to a Sanwa only with higher tension, a quicker engage, and louder clicking. Actually, maybe it's more like a Seimitsu with longer throw... If you don't know what any of that means, just know that I had no trouble kicking tail in Ultra Street Fighter IV or King of Fighters 98 and never once felt like I was robbed due to substandard controls. I will probably still replace the stick with a quieter Sanwa model, but I'm very tempted to leave the buttons as-is. Looking at the shell, the physical design is weighty but ergonomic, and the visual style is best described as ""plain yet classy."" Out of the box, I give this stick a 9 out of 10 compared to a MadCatz TE.

Being a fan of most RPGs I would buy it based on the great ratings and then feel stupid for it due to my own inability to ""get it"".  Fast forward to this generation and I was between a couple of games so I decided to pick it up on the cheap and give it a ""true effort""
Well I am just incredibly happy and fortunate I did.  It may be the best game I have ever played.  It has a stiff learning curve, you are not handheld or led to your objectives.  You will likely kill some valuable NPCs  (Gavlan I am talking to you!)  You will misuse  your souls more than you would ever dream.  But if you stick with it and take the game at a slow pace you will soon move over the learning curve and find yourself in this gamer's paradise of sorts.  You will look up the WIKI on the game and find strategies to beat bosses, you will figure out which of those walls is truly illusional and not just a trick someone is playing on you.  You will find loops in how to approach stages and you will want to get every single soul you can to level up that mechanic or to buy that item to open up a new path.
The game is deep and rigid but it can be handled by anyone willing to put the time in to get better at it.  Soon those big bosses will be easier to handle.  You will understand the rolling approach or parrying.  You will reset your game to try other classes of characters that fit your style.  You will want the game to pass by slowly because you will fall in love with its rough exterior.  You WILL count down the hours until work is over so you can drop back into the world and clear each area of all souls.  It's addictive and the added STRESS of losing hard earned souls gives even the most mundane leveling up a flavor that is more than satisfying to consume.
You will be invaded by other players and you will be in the middle of farming and it will make your heart pound as you look for the RED PHANTOMS to come and challenge you.  You will hate it and you will love it.
In a nutshell this is Dark Souls 2.  It's just so well made and there are so many secrets and ways to pass your time.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend.  Put in the time and you will feel a sense of accomplishment that goes beyond trophies or achievements.  It's more about conquering seemingly impossible odds and then afterward finding something even harder to do.  But you get better and better and the buttons become second hand knowledge.  Please do yourself a favor if you like RPGs and approach this like a fine wine.  Be PATIENT!!!!  Don't expect to move quickly but set smaller goals for game play time purposes.

So I decided to go the economical route. I got this version from a Japanese seller. I plays just fine on my US account and updates but in order to play online you'll need a japanese account. It isn't that hard just create a new account and set the region to Japan and enter info but set your zip code as a Japan Zip. Plus you'll have access to the Japanese psn and if you get a japanese psn card you can buy japanese games or the dlc for this. The only obvious problem is if you don't read japanese, but some things are written in english and some english is spoken. For some reason it seems like the japanese version has a few more moves. I do not know if it is because the US version I played was a demo but I seem to prefer the japanese version. This isn't your typical 3d fighter it doesn't play like tekken or SF.

3420,5.0,"When it comes to virtual board games, Nintendo has really conquered that market for the past several years with the success of the Mario Party franchise. Undoubtingly, the series that started from the Nintendo 64 back in 1999, has been the dominant force in the Mario spin-off franchises. It has proven to do so well from the N64, 4 editions for Nintendo's last home console, the Gamecube, and the recent success of Mario Party 8 for the Wii, the mini-game series has still remained as popular as it has been before. The biggest glitch though has remained in the handhelds. With the faults that have occured from the Game Boy Advance edition of Mario Party, many hanheld gamers have still been anxious for something a bit more to hold on too for the party. Now, with a new version for the Nintendo DS, it has proven to be a different course.

Mario Party DS brings the popular Mario board game series to a different handheld, and does deliver. There are over 70 different mini-games that range well from the simple use of the stylus, to the button mashing we all loved from before. There are five differnet boards for you to play on ranging from Toadette's Music Room, to Wiggler's Garden, the caterpillar from Super Mario 64, and many more to play with. There are also so many games to play around with that take full advantage of the Nintendo DS like more boss battles like Hexoskeleton, where you have to knock down a king-sized Dry Bones, to his knees by kicking fruits at him, to make him spill down to the floor, or the all-new Rotisserie Rampage, where one player is spinning the meat the other three players are on top of, as you try to roast them out to dry.

The gameplay takes full advantage of the DS as you even use the stylus, and the microphone in a game like Blowdown, where you'd have to knockdown a giant whomp by blowing into the mike. The graphics have proven to work much better here, than the e-card and the GBA versions of Mario Party, and takes the gameplay to a whole new innovation, as was the case with the Wii version. Sadly though, there is one big disadvantage with the game, there are 5 boards to play on, a few fewer than the editions from the N64 and Gamecube versions. Nevertheless, it still remains big on the graphics, sound, and fun all in one. It takes a step in the direction DS owners have desired for the franchise.

All in all, if you haven't played any edition of Mario Party before for the Gamecube, Wii, or N64 days, you'll definitely love this one for the Nintendo DS. It has so much fun at a great value in gameplay, excitement, and everything you'd expect from Mario, Luigi and company in a game that is fun and loveable in the palms of your hand.

You need monsters to work on the seasonal islands to obtain crops. Don't let the monsters hit you because if you run out of HP (health points) you pass out and you wake up at 10 am. And you might have a cold. The same thing happens if you stay up until 5 am. Don't attack king monster gates until you think you are ready. I did that once and passed out very quick. My brother and I both love this game (don't worry if your siblings say you will do awful at fighting because mine does and I'm confident). So are you ready for fighting and adventure?! I hope you are!  Written by Rachel age 10",0.0027164356111724513

3439,5.0,"++++++ BACKGROUND ++++++
X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a remake of the classic game X-Com: UFO Defense (UFO: Enemy Unknown outside North America) released in 1994 and is considered one of the top ten games of all time for the computer.

There are currently two re-makes currently undergoing development to be published by 2K. The first, known as XCOM, will be produced by Irrational games and depicts the XCOM universe as a First Person Shooter in the 1950's although recent announcements suggest it has been moved to the 1960's and will be squad based combat.

The second, X-Com: Enemy Unknown, was developed by Firaxis games and consists of the game I am currently reviewing. Firaxis are veteran developers of the genre of strategy games due to development of games such as Alpha Centauri and Civilization under the guidance of Sid Meier, one of the companies co-founders and creators of such classic games as Sid Meier's PIRATES!, Civilization, and Railroad Tycoon.

++++++ GAMEPLAY & COMBAT ++++++
X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a return to the world of single player strategy games that are few and far in-between in this world of first person multi-player shooters. Gameplay is divided in-between two areas; management and battle skirmishes.

In management, you build up your bases, upgrade facilities, preform research and development of weapons all the while monitoring your finances which always feel like a heavy burden you are carrying upon your shoulder you just cannot escape.

The skirmishes are where the meat and bones of the game lie and where you may spend a majority of your time. Simple choices you make in a turn-based fashion have an overall effect on the outcome of the battle. If you slip and make a poor choice the computer will make you feel that error. It may seem fun to go around and annihilating everything in your pass by using high explosive weapons but strategy requires you to capture and collect your enemies bodies and weapons. To get close requires strategy, planning, and luck several moves out. A well thought out strategy and turn is the key to success.

You spend your time recruiting, customizing, and developing your soldiers while watching them rise through the ranks after each successful mission becoming attached in the process only to have them fall in combat....and fall they shall. Your memorial wall will be filled by the midpoint of the game from the losses you will sustain. With the close intimacy of you and your men, the loss of a high ranking officer is a devastating moment to be played through and experience first hand.

The gameplay, compared to the original, has been streamlined but that is expected as the fact the game has been customized to fit the multiple of consoles it has been released for as well as the fact the field of gaming has changed a tremendous amount in the eighteen years since the original was released. The console does play rather well compared to its keyboard/mouse counterpart on the PC.

++++++ GRAPHICS & PRESENTATION ++++++
The graphics are, obviously, an improvement over its 1994 counterpart. I have had several issues with camera angels. Also, the action shots that you endure that became popular since Fallout 3 are entertaining if somewhat repetative. The skirmishes provide a very destructive environment that will leave the battlefield resembling swiss cheese that was burnt in a microwave.

++++++ CHALLENGE ++++++
The game is challenging but is not at the point where you feel as if you need to throw the controller at the wall because you have reached an in pass in gameplay.

Some have stated that this game is more difficult than the original. The reason why is the original X-Com in 1994 contained an error so all difficulty levels were the same. Later X-Com games were noted for their increased difficulty because this issue was fixed in sequels and later editions of the game.

++++++ STORY ++++++
The story is, overall, engrossing throughout the game and provides motivation to make it to the finish to see the end result. Who doesn't enjoy a good Human VS the Evil Aliens story?

++++++ CONCLUSION ++++++
This game is worthwhile of the title ""X-Com"" even with the high expectations and standards set before it by the classic ""X-Com"" of 1994. This game has met and exceeded the challenges set before it.

Highly recommended for those that enjoy turned based strategy games as well as those that desire something different than the dozens of first person shooter games that now littler the video game marketplace.",-0.003765498605825611

3443,5.0,"Didn't purchase on amazon, but did via ebay. Never played this game before or knew much about the storyline. It is truly one of the best games I've ever played. I'm sure I'm not writing anything new on the topic, but the graphics were solid between the playable portions and the cut scenes, the voice acting was splendid, and the storyline was beautifully written. It is as if you are playing through a well-crafted movie. The gameplay was also very good. I haven't played a GTA game in years (since the overhead PC versions in the olden days) so this third person over the shoulder view and shooting system was slightly new to me. Crafting items, using stealth, and trying to properly use (or not use) too much ammo helped to make each encounter a nail biter. The fact that this also includes the DLC: Left Behind is a great addition.

If I had purchased this at full price and had already purchased the PS3 version I wouldn't have given this 5 stars, but as a first time buyer and for only 10 bucks this was definitely the purchase of the year. Still going through the commentary.",0.0458360131691915

3447,5.0,"I've always loved games that mix genres into one package (Vice: Project Doom, Gargoyle's Quest, Golgo 13 etc.) and Actraiser is up there as a mix of townbuilding and action platformer! You basically play as god on a quest to make humanity thrive, and protect it from Satanic demons. The townbuilding sequences are really simple: you just expand towns in different directions, tell the people what to build, have them destroy enemy spawn points and shoot enemies disturbing the peace. You also get messages form your people praying to you to help execute an objective for them, whether it be ending a plague or making more farmland. Once your town is perfect, however, you go into another action platformer segment.

They're similar to Castlvania, Valis IV and Run Saber, just run forward, get through some platforming segments and slash enemies. You play one before building your town and one more when your town is prosperous enough. they're simple, fun and fast paced with some fantastic graphics and music!

Neither of the genres here are gonna win any awards of game design- very simple townbuilding, very simple action segments with some clumsy enemy and level design, but they're both fun, have great graphics, great music and having them in one package with a very unique setting and premise makes Actraiser one of the standout titles on the SNES! I feel fans of action games will love actraiser more than fans of townbuilding/god games will, but for fans of either genre, Actraiser is a really fun and addictive game with fantastic presentation!

Once I found this for a decent price of 5 bucks, I immediately clicked buy, and boy am I glad I did.

The controls I had to get used to, but it wasn't horrible or impossible. The sound effects are awesome and the music is also better than the PC version. The game does have difficult puzzles but they are not impossible and the enemies are really awesome.

3459,5.0,"I actually had no awareness of the source material before I played ""The Wolf Amoung Us"". The Fable comicbook series was something I've never heard of, but I was aware of public television attempts to accomplish similar settings; A mash up of fairytales trying to coexist in and stay relevant in modern urban or cityscape setting. It's a more reoccuring fixation in the past few years, this retelling of fairy tales trend, and it's interesting to me personally in many ways. How do our fairy tales hold up to modern values? If confronted with modern day problems, how would they react? If given a different prespective are the villians still so evil and the heroes still so good?

In this game, those questions are both confronted and addressed pretty well and is a good source of the story's' power over it's audience. Unlike other retellings and reimaginings, the Fable characters are both very aware of their histories as storybook characters and constantly make the audience aware of the traditional versions of their stories. Instead of the writer rewriting the characters so that they fit new sterotypes, the characters look upon the original grim versions of thier tales as a harsh sort of history that most of them are trying to move on from. It works very well. The personal struggles with change, pain, sadness, and most notably in the main character's case, regret add's to the story's harsh and mature tone in a very belivable way.

Story wise, the genre is mostly a murder mystery, dipped in the sheep's clothing of a fantasy. The player takes charge of Bigby (yes, the Big Bad Wolf himself) who, after the fables fled their respective world and established they're community in the modern world, was charged with the task of law enforcer. Of course, one of the story's biggest pulls is the contridiction of that. Bigby was and is still seen by most of the other fables as THE villain and nobody really trusts him. Internally, Bigby also struggles with himself, he is raw power combined with a dark animalistic nature, but he is also incredibly lonely and sick of it. The player guides Bigby's actions throughout the season, both shaping the progress of Bigby's internal struggle and solving the external murder mystery.

Adding to the story's power is the artwork and voice acting. The art is cell shaded just right to that of a harshly lit comicbook. It feels almost like a colored in noire film and reflects the gritty, angry, mood of the stories setting. The voice acting is brilliant, clear and very emotional.

3491,5.0,"Sometimes, critics suprise me. While most of the time they help me choose products with reliable reviews, sometimes they disappoint me. This is the case with Alpha Protocol, a game that was praised for its RPG elements, but criticized for its weak shooting and sneaking mechanics. After buying it, I completely disagree. Alpha Protocol is one of the most underrated games of all time.

The story is an ambitious one. It features an astoundingly dynamic plot that changes depending on the choices that you make. While other games have tried to do this, no game has done it as good as Alpha Protocol. These choices are timed, meaning you don't have an unlimited amount of time to think about what to do. You have to think fast. The spy theme would have been interesting alone, but these timed choices making makes it all the more awesome.

For instance, early in the game, I went on a mission to intercept a weapons dealer suspected of selling weapons in the middle-east. I sneaked through the camp, and caught him. This is where the choice making began. I engaged in conversation with the man. I maintained a professional approach to the conversation. Then, as I was confronted with the next timed choice, there was an ""Execute"" option. I ended up sparing him.

This brought up the question - what would have happened if I had killed him? Would he have a private army come to me to avenge his death? How would my superiors react? What would the consequences be?

It's moments like these that make Alpha Protocol special. The intracies demand multiple playthroughs of the game, and I always wanted to play more to see how the game would play out if I chose a different approach.

Beyond the fantastic story, the gameplay is strictly RPG. Don't expect an Uncharted-like adventure that focuses on shooting. This is a game that sticks closely to the RPG rules. That being said, the game is fantastic when it comes to basic gameplay. There are three elements of gameplay - shooting, stealth, and minigames. Each one is handled well, and are polished enough that it can compete with other shooters in the genre.

Shooting probably got the most criticizing from the critics. They claimed that when you have your aiming reticule right upon the enemy's head, that doesn't mean that you will hit him. They also stated that pistols were completely inaccurate. This is where the critics messed up. I played through the game as a stealth agent, specializing in pistols. I upgraded my pistol stats at every oppertunity. I experienced no problems in my accuracy after I upgraded that tree enough.

This re-introduces the fact that this game is an RPG. Don't expect to excel in pistols if you haven't applied a single upgrade to that tree. You must choose the weapons that you have upgraded your skills for.

Anyways - back to shooting mechanics. The game features a standard third-person cover-shooting mechanics, similar to Uncharted or Gears of War. You can peer out of cover to shoot bad guys with a variety of weapons. The cover system is easy to use, and I have no issues with it. Overall, the shooting is pretty solid overall. As long as you can keep in mind that it is an RPG, you can easily enjoy the shooting.

Same goes for stealth - your skills and upgrades in stealth will determine if you can excel in it. The skills that you unlock as you progress in stealth are more than worth the investment, and lead to you becoming the ultimate stealth warrior. My only complaint is that stealth can feel a bit basic at times. Don't expect anything too advanced, like shadows and camo. Alpha Protocol is basically about hiding behind a box, waiting for the guy to come around near you, then kill him. Stealth definitely gets more deep as you progress, but I still feel it could be a bit more deep.

As for minigames, they  are incredibly easy to pick up, and I encountered no problems. There are three minigames - lockpicking, computer hacking, and alarm bypassing. Lockpicking is easy - you apply force to the pin using L2, and set the pin using R2. Computer hacking is the hardest - you must find specific combinations of letters and numbers in a data stream. May be hard to new players, but it gets easier the more you do it. Finally, alarm bypassing is also easy. It is the most fun of the minigames, and easy for new players to pick up.

Overall, Alpha Protocol's RPG influenced gameplay is fantastic. Upgrading your skills is addictive, and the shooting and stealth are respectable, and a blast to play through.

As for the graphics, Alpha Prtotocol is also great. Character models look fantastic, and the cutscenes look incredible. Environments look awesome, with detailed textures. However, the animations can range from good to slightly exaggerated. The best example of this is the running animation, which looks unintentionally stupid. Also, there is a lot of texture pop-in, especially when looking through menus. It takes about a second for the texture to pop-up seemingly EVERY TIME you want to view a different item. However, these flaws do little to detract from the beauty of the game. Alpha Protocol still looks great, even if it won't be going up against Uncharted anytime soon.

Audio is also fantastic, with some incredible voice acting and script. The great voice acting makes the characters in the story feel more than just cardboard cutouts. The sound effects for the guns aren't anything special, but the music is fantastic, and adds to the super-spy theme - you'll feel like you're in a James Bond film.

The lasting appeal of the game is phenomonal. The game is incredibly lengthy (up to 15 hours), and the decision making adds incredible value to an already deep game. I'm constantly wanting to go back and see how a different approach to the game affects the game. There is no online play, but a game as good and deep as this one doesn't need it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the review summary. It is rated on an out of ten scale.

Story: 10

Everything about the story reminds me of a spy film. The decision making means that each playthrough has potential to be completely different.

Graphics: 8.5

While the animations can be exaggerated and the pop-in is abundant, the cutscenes look fantastic and the character models look great.

Audio: 10

The game features an incredibly musical score, and the voice action is believable, and undeniably delivers.

Gameplay: 9.5

While the strictly RPG gameplay may turn off hardcore shooter fans, it will definitely appeal to the RPG fans. Polished shooting, awesome stealth, cool minigames, and an in-depth leveling mechanic - what's not to love?

Lasting Appeal: 9.5

While the game won't last forever, it definitely has some fantastic replay value. The impressive decision making ensures that you'll be playing Alpha Protocol for some time.

Overall Score: 9.5 out of 10",0.03357718901599073

3493,5.0,"Disney Infinity is everything I hoped it would be: great gameplay, great graphics, huge variety of unlockables, and high quality figures to satisfy the action figure collector side of me.

 The starter pack lets you choose between three different types of gameplay. There are the play sets, which serve as open world story modes based on specific Disney movies (the starter pack comes with Monsters University, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Incredibles), Toy Box Mode, which is pretty much build a world and play in it with any Disney Infinity character available, and Toy Box Adventures Mode, which are just various missions that you can do with any character available (every figure comes with their own character-exclusive Adventure). All of these modes are fun, and chances are, you'll enjoy at least one of them. I, for one, enjoyed all of them. The only downer is that when you've done all of these things you're done until you buy more figures or play sets. Despite this minor set back, I really like the gameplay.
 Disney Infinity chose to make everything look like a plastic toy, so don't expect everyting to look just like the source material. Everything looks significantly cartoonier than usual, which isn't a bad thing at all. They chose this style so that all the Disney characters would fit in together, which isn't the easiest thing to do, but Avalanche didn't disappoint. Despite it's cartoony look, there's a lot of lighting and details that make this game pop. This IS a good looking game.
 Not much to say about the sound. Some of the voice acting is great and will sound just like the original actor/actress (sometimes they ARE the original) while other times the voice acting's really lousy. And sometimes, some of the things the characters say are cheesy or really annoying. The music is pretty good. If it's not taken from the movie, it sounds like it could be. So, it's really hit-or-miss when it comes to sound.
 While they're not as detailed as the Skylanders, the figures themselves are really good. They still have that cartoonish look I mentioned earlier, and since they're supposed to look plastic, they don't as much detail as the Skylanders do. But even still, I'd much prefer buying figures of characters I know and like then buying figures of characters that I've never even heard of. WARNING: they are not to be played with! I haven't played with them, but I've heard a lot of complaints about them breaking. If you just display them and only move them when you're ready to play as that character in the game, you shouldn't have a problem. One of my favorite aspects of the game is that each character is designed to play and fight just like they would in the movie(Jack Sparrow walks with a swagger, Woody's run is really flimsy, etc.), so that's another plus to getting these figures. My biggest problem is the lack of classic characters, but that problem will probably be fixed in later figure waves.

 The only real difference between the Wii U version and the other HD versions of the game, is the Gamepad capabilities. Using the touch screen, building stuff in the Toy Box and switching between tools and weapons is a little bit easier. Other than that, they're the exact same game. If you have the option to get it on Wii U, I would recommend buying that version. Not much else can be said of this game. It's a great game, and I completely recommend this game to Disney fans everywhere!",0.03275117563981435
3494,5.0,"...as turning Tomb Raider from a vague jumping puzzle/auto-aim adventure with a weak narrative to a primarily story-driven survival game made for stirring, STRESSFUL action set pieces that were interspersed with the lots of exploration and fun. Sure, the actual TOMBS that are there to be raided are few and far between, the layout of the island and the experience/upgrade system is great.

I loved the idea that you're never quite sure if there's something mundane or spiritual going on making the island a treacherous prison of pirates, cultists, and survivors, but seeing it all play out, success followed by tragedy, over and over again, was great! Especially as it's done through the eyes of a somewhat hesitant Lara, who is forced to come into her own over the course of the game as opposed to being the stereotypical, top heavy avatar of the past.

Gameplay-wise, I love that switch from press-and-hold auto-aiming that I recall from the 90's/00's to actual skill-based aiming... particularly when using the bow (it was my first set of upgrades). Sure, there's been a rash of bow use in pop culture, from books to movies to games, but I really love what was done here (and in Farcry 3).

There are a few disappointments for me, though... such as the lack of depth concerning the supernatural guardians in the second and third acts of the game and the final boss sequence being a slow motion aim test a la the first COD:MW. Still, even though that fight disappointed me, it was pretty badass to have it be the moment where a certain character habit manifests for the first time in the game.

Overall, the Tomb Raider reboot is a great gaming experience and worth playing. Not quite the same sandboxy quality of FarCry 3 and a bit behind in the story department when compared to Uncharted, but a worthy competitor and much better than previous iterations of the series.

3496,5.0,"I don't understand why in an industry where originality and uniqueness is key to maintaining success, the gamers are so resistant to any sort of change whatsoever. Team ninja revamped metroid in a way no one was really expecting, and people just wigged out.

Metroid goes back to it's platformer roots, but in the way Bruce Willis yippekaye'd his way into action movie roots. The controls are simple enough but there is so much action and adrenaline even in the simplest of moves, flashes of light, mini explosions, cement tearing skid marks. And like any respectable
platformer it's got more creepies to indiscriminately gun down than ever before. I played metroid's first fps game, corruption and that was new as well, but while previous games emphasized the lonely silent exploration of Samus Aran, this one is refreshingly talkative and busy. Finally a game that had you on the edge of the seat and doesn't put you to sleep 3 times through the level.

The wii remote pointing and aiming restricted fps gaming seqeuences are plenty distracting though, and awkward to control initially, but a little patience and practise goes a long way. And by the end it becomes second nature, and you wondered what you were complaining about in the first place.

There's not enough games today that truly embrace the fast paced platformer action, and that's a shame. Metroid other M, bravely goes where no games on any console have gone in recent history. And it is games like these that will keep the wii in competition with current gen consoles, especially with gaming veterans.",0.016289975441006542

You have all the songs unlocked (well, most of them) so you could practice before going to the campaign and do all those tricky notes in the songs. There are cool songs like from ""The ramones"" and "" Fall out boys"" and it's worth your time playing it a couple of hours.

3499,5.0,"Simply put this may be the last RTS game you will ever need.  It can fill any RTS niche and do it all within one game.  You can select any era of play starting with the prehistoric age where your citizens must hunt and gather as they had not learned how to farm at that point and you can play up through an advanced space age with giant mechs, robots, and laser infantry.  Most often I'll pick one age and not advance past it.  If I want to play a modern day game I can sellect the Atomic II era and play with Apache Helicopters and B-52 nuclear bombers.  You can zoom all the way in to ground level and while it is a nice feature it is almost useless in a combat situation.  It is best when you are finishing off an enemy and you want to see the action close up.  Another nice thing I like is that the aircraft fly realistically.  Airplanes take off, fly around and then have to land when they run out of fuel.
I've seen some reviewers give bad ratings due to their computers locking up.  This is not a problem with Empire Earth.  I had the same problem but did a little research into it and found out that the Zone Alarm firewall program has some compatability issues with Empire Earth as well as a few other games.  I switched to Symantec Internet Security and haven't had any problems since.  Note that Zone Alarm will lock up your machine if you are playing Empire Earth EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT PLAYING ON LINE. Once again, this is NOT a problem with Empire Earth.
To sum it up, this is the RTS that I keep coming back to even when there are more advanced RTS games on the market.  Keep an eye out... Empire Earth 2 is coming soon.  :)",-0.010585057054700173

The right analog button on the PS3 version was a little bit of a pain in the neck to use when adjusting the camera but not on the Vita version.  That really impressed me.  If you have any issues with the Vita's button layout, fear not since this game can be played on the Playstation TV with a Dualshock 3 or 4 controller.  The same goes for Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 as well.  You might as well not buy the PS3 version and go with the Vita/PSTV version instead since you can take it on the go.

I was one of the people who thought the Vita would be a waste of money and boy I was wrong.  The Vita & 2/3DS are holding up against their console brothers pretty well.

3526,5.0,"Lumines, never fails to deliver an addicting and energetic puzzle rush.  Electronic Symphony is probably the best Vita title as of today.  If you've ever played Lumines before on the original PSP or PS2 it's not very different, however there are subtle changes that are welcome.

Most of the songs are licensed, so you'll hear some familiar tunes such as ""Hey boy Hey Girl"" from the Chemical Brothers (also on Just Dance 3) and such.  The power of the Vita gives the skins vibrant colors and the blocks are 3 dimensional when you shift them to the right or left.  The colors really do pop out on the huge vita screen and sometimes I feel like I am in a trance playing this game.  You really can't really do much to improve an already amazing series such as Lumines.

There are not very many modes.  You have a couple to choose from and they are voyage mode, master mode, duel, stopwatch and playlist mode.  Voyage mode is basically a marathon session you erase blocks as long as you can to get a high score.  Master mode is basically an extreme difficulty mode with (I think) 4 tiers of difficulty.  Duel is what it is, you duel against another player locally via adhoc only, which is kind of a bummer, but oh well.  Stopwatch will give you a time limit which you pick and you have however many seconds to clear the most blocks within that time limit.  Playlist mode you can pick all the tracks you want to play within a sequence or just endlessly loop one track.  There is another feature that isn't a mode, so I just say it is a feature.  That feature is world block.  The world block is a huge block with 2 million blocks and however many blocks you clear during an entire days worth of playing you contribute to shrinking the world block with everyone around the world playing this game.  So say you clear 440 blocks throughout a one day session, you will remove 440 blocks from the 2 million block world block.  Am I confusing you yet?  It seems as if a lot of people have this game because every time I access world block it is already cleared for the day!!

As you continue playing the game you have a level that grows with XP depending on how many blocks you clear in any mode.  I like this feature, because it echoes an RPG system and with certain levels you gain you'll get more skins (new songs) and avatars for use in duel mode.  Due to the leveling system you might just find yourself wanting to climb the all time high score list.  My highscore is around 120,000 and some people are in the 1,000,000s.  With that said, you will get addicted to this and that is a good thing, after all you might just be waiting for the train ride home or your cousins foot surgery.

Wow, I cant believe this review turned into 4 paragraphs.  It is due to this game being a very strong launch title and perhaps my favorite puzzler on a handheld ever.  If you just got your Vita and you have indecision about which titles to pick up, Lumines Electronic Symphony will not disappoint you at all.  I am very happy with this game and you will be to!",0.016554267739587052

3547,5.0,"Sonic 3D Blast is a radical departure from the other classic Sonics. It takes gameplay from the Flicky arcade/Genesis game, and throws Sonic action and great fake 3D into the blender!

There are so many zones in this game that you probably wouldn't have time to finish the game. The bad part about that is that there's no saving or loading, BUT the closest thing to that is the level select. The level select, while it can be accessed by a button code, can also be accessed by cartridge tilting. It's secretive, yeah, but it's the closet thing to a save feature. That's what makes this version superior over the Saturn game: Easy level select access.

The Special Stages, while presented in even better fake 3D, are very easy. You have to cross a huge bridge over lava or the Earth, collecting rings and dodging spike bombs. You can probably finish one with over 300 or 200 rings.

The main gameplay is about saving Flickies after you kill the Badniks. Then you must toss 'em into a giant ring that lets you go to the next part of the level.

Shields are still present. There's the regular shield, the fire shield, and a golden one that lets you use the Homing Attack, a new addition to Sonic games since Sonic Adventure, in which that game and so on lets you use it as a normal attack.

Overall, I could have given this 4 stars if I hadn't known about how cartridge tilting accesses the level select. That really helped calm myself. The Flicky/Sonic style action has made a unique twist on the series.",0.017231787820023117

3559,5.0,"There have been many Batman games but not many good ones, Batman: Arkham Asylum is the first game where you feel like Batman and you get to do all the things Batman can do, you really become the detective and caped crusader that is Batman. This game really has a sence of darkness and the story line is perfect for this type of game. If you are not sure about it then download the demo because if you don't try that you really are missing out on a great game.
Plot: The game begins with Batman capturing the Joker after his latest plot and escorting him to Arkham Asylum for imprisonment. Due to the Joker's recent attack on Gotham's Blackgate Prison, a large number of sane convicts have been transferred. However, the Joker, with the help of Harley Quinn, frees all the inmates and closes Arkham Asylum with Batman and Commissioner Gordon inside. Joker then threatens to detonate bombs all around Gotham if someone tries to enter the building. Batman must uncover the full extent of the Joker's plan while contending with the horrors of Arkham and was not expecting much from the game because I had mixed feelings about the demo. But as soon as I put the full game in, it freaking blew my away. The graphics and presentation suddenly hit me when I began to play the intro of Arkham Asylum. They made the visuals and it surroundings so believable that I thought I really had Batman in my grasp to controle. It is obvious from the start that the developers put sweat and tears into the game. Every chapter of Arkham Asylum is well thought out and realized. The gadgets aren't just there for show, they make you use them because of the well crafted level design. The free flow combat is great but if you can produce some combos and add some gadgets and moves into the mix, the hand to hand combat becomes even better. In conclusion, I will quote IGN by saying ""Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time."" That is a bold statement but i truly believe that the game deserves it.",-0.004389506225217627

3562,5.0,"I first heard of Dark Cloud fourteen years ago when my cousin didn't sleep because he was playing it nonstop. We were 8 at the time! In 2010, my sister received Dark Cloud 2 as a gift from someone and we loved it. Recently, I was looking for a new game to play and found a new Dark Cloud 1 for cheap on Amazon! So, I purchased it and can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Dark Cloud is extremely addicting, and I found myself doing the same as my cousin did so many years ago -- staying up all night because every time I finished a stage of a dungeon, I found more villagers and materials to rebuild my town. The game has very addicting gameplay as a result. It can get very repetitive, but finding more atla (as they're called in the game) and leveling up weapons keeps you coming back.

My only gripe with the game is the story. It's very broken up and odd how characters go from one part to the next. It's almost entirely illogical, and lines of the story are just dropped without a word. Also, lots of foreshadowing occurred and none of it actually happened at the end of the game. Dark Cloud 2 did a better job of this, so I'm glad to see that that was improved upon in the sequel.

Regardless, the game was still excellent, hence why I give it 4.5, leaning towards 5. The rest of the experience does make up for its downfalls. I suggest Dark Cloud to any gamer whom likes RPGs and/or action-adventure!",-0.04737961225333349
3563,5.0,"I can honestly say I've never played a game that has stuck with me this long after finishing, nor one that convinced me to play twice.  And then again.  And then 7 more times. This game is truly something special, and if you are on the fence or trying to figure out if you would like it... let me just say You Will LOVE IT.

This is not a Zombie game - this is an Apocalypse game. Imagine what the world as we knew it would be like if it was shaken up by a virus killing a majority of the population. There would be fighting, quarantine zones, shelters, failed attempts to bring about normalcy.  In the end, you would have localized societies and currencies, but nothing would be the same: no electricity, computers, manufacturing, and people would be living off the previous generations' leftovers.  Some things would last, but most would rust, decay, decompose, crumble, sink, fall, lean, leak, split, explode, or simply be buried by mother nature.  Imagine that world.  What The Last of Us did for me, was paint a picture so vivid, that it lasted long after the game ended, and it had me itching to play it again.

Also - I knew I liked ""mature"" games, but I was afraid this would be a gory game, focusing on blood, guts, satanic symbols, etc.  Nope. It doesn't need to.  There are bits and pieces you can put together if you pay attention, but the story is focused on the characters not the zombies.  It's the dialog, the scenery, the friendships, the struggles, and the lost past that make the journey worth experiencing again - not the scares, trigger points, headshots, etc.

- Most beautiful graphics I have ever seen in a game
- Most realistic dialog I have ever experienced in a game
- Very well realized setting
- Overall Gameplay mechanics are FUN.  Naughty Dog made sneaking FUN without needing to play 20 times to memorize each person's patterns.
- Voice acting is top notch.  Nothing comes close.  I must say, every character had WOW factor for me, and their facial expressions, body language, and overall actions matched their voices perfectly.
- Game Length is short enough you will WANT to play again. When playing a 120hr game, I am DONE by the time I am fimished.  This game was short enough that I actually looked forward to playing again and re-visiting the early chapters.",0.0006206863056320155

3573,5.0,"I loved the first Halo, and I'm sure most of you also did. While I was playing the first one, I never thought any FPS could be any better - and that was, obviously, before I put my hands on Halo 2.

Halo 2 was hyped as hell, if it wasn't the best game ever it would disappoint gamers, so Bungie worked on it really hard for nearly three years. I was kind of let down at first when I saw that the most complex textures and details in the CG-like movies appeared moments after the basic ones. It's not a big thing, but it's still something. But when the intro was over, I got shocked... Could those be the graphics? Oh my God! The most incredible graphics I've ever seen in my entire life... It began a little bit like Half-Life, and when I found out I could shoot with two weapons at once, I said to myself: this is going to be the best game ever. Soundtrack and sound effects are far superior than usual even in a normal TV. I wasn't able to plug my Xbox into my home theater, but as far as I know, the result can't be compared to any other games avaliable. One thing I liked about the soundtrack is that the classical soundtrack from the first one has been changed and now there's a lot of rock'n'roll tunes - I like both classical and rock music, but guitars fit the world of Halo way more than pianos and violins, and you've got to agree. Voice acting is also top notch.

Now there are new enemies in the game. The variety of enemies still isn't the best thing ever, but it never gets repetitive. New weapons (I love the energy sword, it's the most powerful weapon), new vehicles... Halo 2 has improved the first one in every way possible. I loved the controls in the first one, and this time they're even better. AI is great... Enemies and allies are really smart - not smarter than me, though (hahaha) - in 99% of the gameplay. I have witnessed some parts of the game where the AI kind of failed - allies stopped shooting due to nothing while in a vehicle, allies refused to get into the Warthlog for no reason... Other interesting thing in this game is that you play with two characters: Master Chief and an alien, so it's two different views of the story.

Let's talk about the Xbox Live gameplay... Holy Spartans! I don't have much experience in online gameplay (it was the second time I've played anything online), but I must warn you: it's highly addictive. If you're tired about the single player game, ok, it's possible, but you can't get tired of this. It's different every time you play. There are many game modes, scenarios and there's still more to come - Bungie is always planning some new download contents. And Halo 2 includes a special code so you can play the game online with absolutely no charge for two full months. C'mon, play Halo 2 free, online for two months, you can't miss it. All you need is a high-speed internet connection and a credit card, nothing else. If you want to continue playing, no problem: pay a US$50 tax to play for another year or buy a Xbox Live Starter Kit so you get new games to play online and you don't pay anything else for a year. If you want to cancel, you can also do so and you won't be charged. Such things like playing Halo 2 online can't be written, you must play it, simple as that.

Overall, we're talking about the best game of 2004. I'm not a big fan of first person shooters, but this one absolutely rocks. Since it has no bosses and no puzzles - two things I don't like in games -, it's extra fun. If you think a game with no bosses and no puzzles is basically a very easy game, try to beat it on Legendary mode, dear gamer... Buy it right now! If you don't own an Xbox, it's worthy to buy one only to play this single game, which is, by the way... The best game ever.",0.04275357466533937

+ The price considering all five games is very low.
+ The ""Source Engine"" these games run on are very computer friendly and do not lag even on some older hardware.

CONS
- For those who do not like Steam, don't buy this. I personally have no problem with it, but unfortunately to you people it is required.

I own multiple physical copies of the infinity engine games such as baldur's gate or planescape...

For anyone not wanting to spend time setting up / fighting MODs, this game is a simple installer/launcher  and patched up ready to go with widescreen support, extra classes, fresh content, and practically zero bugs (on my play through).

The amount of Content and replay from both the base game, included expansion Throne of bhaal, and new areas and classes... there are no exaggeration hundreds of hours of enjoyment to dig into. This is a game you can revisit in the years to come with a different class, a different party makeup, different choices.

3608,5.0,"Had given up on this genre years ago due to poor/unrealistic gameplay. Got this because it happened to be on special for 1/2 price that day and thought I'd give it a try for something different as I am a bit of a European Mediaeval history buff. Since that time (and I kid you not) I have derived 60+ solid hours of pleasure out of the product, and only completed 2 campaigns and a few ""historical"" battles) - so it has a lot more shelf life to offer (cheap thrills on an hourly basis!)

Good things - graphics are simply superb, the battles are not easy and different unit's strengths and weaknesses have to be borne in mind constantly to win, allies are often untrustworthy (just like real ones), it takes a long time to build things in your cities/castles (just like it used to), and various environmental forces (including heretics, storms, and the season) have various effects on your settlements. Absolutely engrossing gameplay that will have you hitting the end turn icon and hanging around ""just one more turn honey"" to see what happens over and over.

Things I wish were different (bearing in mind I gave it 5 stars) - Armies move much too slowly sometimes (it didn't take 2 years to sail from England to Italy for example), Princesses are often worthless - if they're not ""charming"" you can't marry them off, and they can't negotiate well as diplomats, and there's nothing you can do about it (like send them to charm school), sometimes in battle the troops get in each other's way and don't go where you tell them, being excommunicated has always had little effect - almost to the point where it is irrelevant, and finally I wish it had some way of showing me units in the field that I have forgotten to move (life gets complicated when you own all of Europe and much of North Africa)

Stuff that was driving me nuts that got fixed in the 1.1 patch - inquistors have much less power to kill your generals, when attacking cities with two armies and one is under AI it doesn't just sit there passively anymore, as well as a bunch of minor things.

On my old machine (P4 HT 3.4, 2gb PC4200RAM, SATA1, nVidia 6800 256mb) everything worked fine except the individual battles took some time to load (not outrageous, but not fast either) and grpahics were fine except on a couple of occasions where I had 2000 or more troops on the screen all doing their own thing - frame rate got bogged down.

On my new machine (PD945 3.4 Dual Core 2gb PC6400RAM, SATAII, nVidia 8800 GTS 640mb) load times are MUCH faster and I have had no frame rate slowing.

Buy this game if you have a decent machine and you don't mind getting really engrossed and ""wasting"" many hours of time taking over the world and wreaking havoc on those who attack you. Along the way, if you read all the detail text on the various buildings (armouries, alchemist labs, abbeys, docks/wharves etc.) you'll actually learn quite a bit about the period 1080-1520: they've done a good job of historical accuracy IMHO.",0.020617182381888262
3609,5.0,"If your an older gamer or just someone who likes older game series you have probaly played Megaman (the original series not X,Legends,Zero,or Battle Network) I remember when I first got my NES when I was 5 and Megaman 2 I loved that game and still do so I saw Megaman 8 for playstaition decided I should check up on this series (I'm more of a Megaman X fan) from the opening movie which is shown in stunning anime to the ending credits this game is flawless the story begins with 2 strange robots fighting in the deep reaches of space when they injure each other so bad that they crash land into earth and Megaman heads to investigate when he gets there Dr. Wily (for you noobs Megaman's main enemy) is carrying off one of the robots which has very evil very powerful energy Wily is harnesting so Megaman helps the second robot and heads after Wily so the battle begins with your standard 4 bosses Clownman,Grenademan,Frostman, and Tenguman(my personal favorite) and after they are done your next four appear Swordman,Astroman,Searchman, and Aquaman(not to be confused with the DC comics hero) you Megaman veterans already know where this is going even though the game is standard Megaman format that same format is perfect and if it ain't broke don't fix it
Graphics wise the game rules its 2D but very good looking 2D the enemies and backgrounds are very detailed I could just stare at them all day but I won't but anyway you older gamers will admit this is a huge step up from NES and SNES(remember the old square shots that would pass off as bullets in the old games?) Megamans graphics Megas little pellet shots even look good his charge up shots have detail and just the basic movements of running jumping and sliding look pretty good

Great the music for each stage is good and even the voice acting in the cut scences is nicely matched also having the cut scences in anime was a great idea seeing Bass and Megaman duke it out in anime is really great to see it really makes the carnival level more fun when you have carnival music as your background all also when you're going through a labyrinth in Astromans stage the music really sets the mood for how strange the level is these are just some examples as all the music really does a good job of setting the mood for fun
Fun factor is what makes this game so great is that there are so many diverse challenges in levels and ways of getting around such as snowboarding,flying via the Rush Jet and even swinging on vines in a jungle so many robots to destroy so little time also there are added challenges like finding 40 bolts that Roll (once again for you noobs Megaman's sister) will make upgrades for Megaman with and its not as hard as some other Megaman installments so if you're rusty on the series or new to it this would be a good place to start basic Megaman formula still is around if you beat a boss you obtain his power example: if you beat Clownman you get his power the Thunder Claw even though I have beaten the game several times I still find myself playing it
The Bottom line here is that Megaman 8 is another perfect Megaman game that seems to just get better with every installment that needs to be in everyones Playstaition collection 10/10
By the way for those of you who agree with my review lets hope for Megaman 9 soon",0.0384280947112999
3610,5.0,"Wow, the atmosphere of this game alone is enough to warrent a paragraph about the ""mood"" of this great Game! I have looked for something like this for a Very long time. (thought I had found it with Rockstar's Manhunt or Manhunt 2 due out 7/30/07) its truly amazing! you start off in a prison cell, and after a few minutes you realize, something is horribly wrong! all the other inmates have vanished and theres blood everywhere. you must explore and be prepared to jump (there is a part that got me even better then RE #1 did with the ""dogs through the windows"" scene) this is a 3rd person adventure type game with tons of shooting and puzzle solving. Tons of killing, blood and gore! it (aside from the gore) really gives you the ""feel"" of being in prison and not a wink of help in sight. the sense of desperation only grows throughout the game. and the ""creatures"" are inspired by their varied criminal acts! right down to ""bodily fluids"" pooling beneath hanging or fallen bodies! this game is brilliant. its really rare a game with this much violence and gore (till you hurl!) turns out so well when so many turn out so poorly. Buy this Now while you still can but I would avoide the sequal as it has many bugs that will freeze the game up. The Suffering is almost art in its sickness! part 2 however is graphicly as pleasing with better deaths etc but considering you will get 50% to 75% through it then have it perma freeze ugh. Cant say Anything bad about this title though. its simply perfect!

Graphics: 4 1/2 stars nothing Uber ground breaking but some of the ""mood"" graphics work really well hence the xtra point and a half.

Sound: 5 Stars! freaky and Superb! you will have nightmares! lol.

Fun Factor: 5 Star Swetness. Kill aha!

overall: 5 stars for a) sickest game and B) most fun sick game!

3611,5.0,"Vine reviewers with kids between the ages of 3 and 8 were asked to review this game, and I think that's a good age range for Just Dance Kids 2.  My 7-year-old enjoys this game, while my 10-year-old prefers the ""big"" Just Dance 3 Kinect game.

This game is structured slightly differently from JD3. When players jump in front of the camera to play, it takes a picture of your face, and with gestures you can select a cartoon avatar that's either boyish or girlish.  (That's an important distinction for young kids!) The videos show actual kids dancing against colorful backdrops, and the steps themselves are much simpler and more repetitive than the regular Just Dance dances. The songlist is more kid-oriented than JD (""Lollipop"" here is the ""lollipop, lollipop, oh lolly lolly lolly"" song, NOT the ""sucking too hard on your lollipop"" song in JD3) although not as large, and so far there's no downloadable songs.  It's very easy for players to jump in and out mid-song, but make sure there's plenty of room for them to jump around - it can get pretty chaotic! The ""create your own dance"" feature is also included and a lot of fun.

This would probably have the most appeal to the Barney and Yo Gabba Gabba set. The controls are easy to use even for the youngest gamers, provided the camera can see them. If they're older and already listen to a lot of pop songs, Just Dance 3 may be a better buy.",0.06335162840064801

The developers make a cool use of the controller with stuff like spray painting and listening to audio files.
There are some shortcomings too. Your interaction with the world and people in it are limited. Pedestrians say things when you walk by, but you can't have a conversation with them. And they only react to you in one of two ways: cheering or cowering in fear. This makes the game feel a bit lifeless. And like many other open world games, it can get a bit repetitive since you mainly do variations of the same thing. I also wish the game was longer.

People give it crap for the controls, and I slightly agree...  They're not as bad as you might think.  The multiplayer isn't anything to write home about but it's sufficient.  It's few game modes (including team death match and capture the flag) offer a pretty fun experience, but you can't play online online.

I recommend downloading the demo first from xbox live.  I did and boy it didn't disappoint.  I recently ordered the game from Amazon and I am glad I finally did!

The gameplay is third person action.  Its set on Arkham Asylum (as the title explains).  You start out with the batarang and a few fight moves, but you have to ""find"" and earn his other gadgets, but the storyline and gameplay make it interesting.  You also have the Riddlers riddles to find throughout the entire game (240 of them which include find ""Question"" marks that unlock trophies, ""Paitent"" tape interviews, Puzzles, etc.) which will keep you going.  You earn points by finding riddles and completing tasks that allow you to apply towards the upgrades of gadgets and combos.  In fact the gadets coincide with finding additional riddles/puzzles because the new gadets allow you to explore new areas that you were unable to get to at first.  The developers also did well with storyline and integrating Batman's features, skills, and the villians into a long single player campaign.

The game also has a Challenge mode which is separate from the single player mode where you are tasked to take on henchmen and preform certain combos or takedowns, etc to gain enough points to gain a medal.

Each item is randomly generated on drop, so you can be certain that you'll have to check out all the stats and re-evaluate your loadout each time you pick up a new item.  Even uniques/story items have different attributes each time they drop.  I haven't gotten to the multiplayer aspects of it, but I hear that is where the real fun is.  With two DLC packs already released, I expect to be playing this game for a while, it seems like a dream for the completionists out there, with side quests galore and plenty of upgrade options.  The actual character leveling isn't too deep, you only get a few options for your skill tree, but its lighter RPG elements don't hurt the game.

3635,5.0,"If you're a fan of Baldur's Gate, be sure to try Untold Legends a try. This little RPG even lets you play multiplayer with your PSP-owning friends!

You start out getting to choose your character - for females there are alchemists and berzerkers, for men there are paladins and druid. For each character you can customize skin tone and hair style. Then a few attribute settings and you're off!

You start with the traditional spider-bashing, moving from room to room, chatting with the various NPCs you meet. Soon you're picking up loot, killing larger monsters, and heading off on quests. Yes, these are the things RPGs are made of, but of course what makes this brilliant is that you can carry it along with you, play it whenever you want, and get the great PSP graphics.

Even better, if you have friends with PSPs, you can all adventure together wirelessly, in study hall or on the train or bus! You can truly pass hours at a time without any effort, customizing your character and building up levels.

It's fun to zoom in, but really, you play most of this game zoomed out so you get as much of the map on the screen as possible. The variety of weapons and spells keep things interesting. You could say that a downside is that the game is pretty straightforward and simple - but you really don't want a super-complex game for a handheld. That's what the big consoles are for. This hack and slash is sort of the 'gauntlet' for the PSP - run around alone or with friends, gain some levels, find some nifty cool weapons, and then hit SAVE when your bus gets to where it is going.

3641,5.0,"For several months I was obsessed with this game. I logged over 40 hours of playing time and probably more like 60 counting the times I left the game w/o saving because I missed something, couldn't get passed a boss, or wanted to cheat my way at the slot machine at Tolbi Springs--and that was with the aid of a walkthrough. I can't imagine how long it would take to conquer this monster game w/o one; there are so many places to go, hidden things to uncover, and useful powers to master. Since Golden Sun was my first role-playing game, I needed all the help I could get.

I loved this game! I was disappointed that there was no conclusion to the story here (that is on the sequel Golden Sun: The Lost Age), but then I realized that I would just need to play more GS, and the more is better when it comes to a game like this. It is very complicated and, at times, incredibly challenging but, with a detailed walkthrough, even a novice like me whose previous proudest video game moment was beating Pitfall II on my Atari 2600 can become a GS master (or mistress as it were). I love that you can save the game almost anytime save for during a battle. You can even save in the middle of a puzzle so you can get tricky parts out of the way and just focus on the next. I wish all games were like that.

You start out as a kid named Isaac (you can customize the name; in fact, if you hit the select button a bunch of times at the start, you can name all the characters). Isaac lives with his mom in a town called Vale. Right away, there is danger lurking as the peaceful town will eventually be destroyed by a giant boulder. A kid named Felix will be swept away in a stream (he will be key to the sequel). You and buddy Garet meet two mysterious adepts, Saturos and Menardi, who are up to no good. They challenge you to a fight. Being just kids with no fighting psynergy, you have no chance. This defeat inspires you and Garet to build up your powers in the aftermath of the avalanche. There is a lot of dialog at the beginning which may make the game appear slow and boring but, be patient, the game will have you hooked before long.

You will use the psynergy you acquire through the game in fighting and, especially, in completing certain tasks like lifting, moving, and carrying heavy objects, turning puddles into ice, and reading minds to help you in your adventure. You also have Djinn: cute little creatures who can fight for you or protect you in battle or, if placed on stand-by, can summon the planets to give you enormous powers. By the time you face Saturos and Menardi again at the end of the game, some 40 hours of logged playing time later, you will have no trouble leveling your revenge.

The final boss isn't all that hard, even the Fusion Dragon they unleash. I defeated them twice, first try each time. The most difficult boss is Deadbeard who lives on a sunken ship at the bottom of the dungeon on Crossbone Island. It took me forever to beat this guy! The trick (and this trick can be used on other big bosses) is to alternate Djinn Flash (with Garet) and Ground (with Isaac) to limit the damage and fight only with Ivan using attack Djinn and summons while Mia is primarily used for healing. This strategy takes a long time--maybe 40 minutes--but it works!

What I like the most about this game are all the neat places you see, various tasks you complete, and all that cool music you hear. There is a different tune for almost every place you visit. I would actually like a CD of all the different GS tunes. You do not have to complete GS to play Lost Age, but I highly recommend it as I recommend getting a thorough, detailed walkthrough. You will get the most out of the game and, before long, you will have mastered both! Good luck adept!",0.03593215760874098

First person shooters are not usually my favorite thing but I bought this one and I love it. The story gets kind of old after a while and the weapons get boring but tats only during single player. The real fun started during multiplay with some friends. I dominated and while they were trying their hardest to hit me with a shotgun from a distance in space I wiped em out with my railgun. This game can be a lot of fun but if your in a samller level with the maximum number of bots and have them on decent diffuculty levels expect some chaos. Chances are right after you spawn you might eat a rocket. I like the fact that when on nightmare level I fire a rocket in their face and they keep on running like nothing happened to them. Then they turn around with a machinegun and mow me down. If you havn't played this game the machine gun is the weakest gun in the game and its what you start out with.

3645,5.0,"Grand Theft Auto 4 brings the acclaimed top selling video game series to a new level, in technicals, storytelling, and gameplay mechanics. The final package is nothing short of remarkable. It is an gameing experience I certainly won't forget.

Technically GTA IV isn't the most mind blowing game this gen, but given the scrope of the Liberty city it's certainly one of most impressive visual achievements in gaming on the PS3 or any other system outside the PC. The sound is great too, sounding fantastic on 5.1 surround. It simply puts you in another world with such fluidity, really groundbreaking. Must be experienced.

The story is simply one of the best I've ever seen in a game, and that includes RPGs. You still get some of the same silliness of previous GTA games, but layered over it is some terrific performances of numerous characters. The cut scenes play like real serious crime dramas and give you plenty of motivation to complete your quests. The story is very multilayed and riveting, dark and sometimes funny, even romantic at times. It's really great.

Gameplay wise it's a definate improvement over other GTA games. In particular combat is drastically improvement. If I have one minor complaint about the it's maybe there are one too many combat centric missions, but they never get boring because the aiming and duck and cover system is so solid. Driving is also improved. I wish there were more customizable options, but in the end playing as Niko, the main character, never gets dull.

And it's absolutely not just for beginners, either. There are songs that will challenge pretty much anyone.

Yes, this ""game"" teaches real-world skills. This is not really a ""game"", but a legit learning tool.

The bass section is full, too. I'm mostly a bassist, and there's plenty to do there. It does not cost anything extra to play the bass tracks. It's all included.

I've been watching this game ever since it was released and waited to buy it because of all the bad reviews. I was waiting to buy it after the price dropped and some updates released for it. The game when I bought it was around $19.99 but I got it for $1.99 and included many updates.

I saw the Demo version of this game and it looked awesome and everyone knows that when the actual game was released it was very bad in many areas from the detail to how the AI played and more. But now a lot of that has been fixed in the updates. The detail is much better and polished, the AI is better but not perfect. I have trouble sometimes with my Marines being left behind as they want move forward but they just stand there doing nothing. One thing I wish they would have added was the ability to damage your surroundings. I love to shoot the lights out and go into stealth mode.

The game sounds amazing with Logitech gaming headset 7.1 surround sound.
The default controls to me are terrible. I had to rearrange some keys. I was only able to get it to 85% that I like.
Not much video settings to change but when I first started to play the game, I thought the game was having trouble with my monitor because it was so grainy but there is an option in the video settings to turn of the grain.
I don't like the armor bar or the health gauge. Armor doesn't even last long and the health gauge can only auto-recharge if the health cell isn't completely empty. I prefer Halo auto-recharge gauge in games.
Upgrades to your weapons is good as I like upgrading things in games.
Weapons are well design in detail including the Legendary weapons but I am having trouble with the pulse rifle that you start out with. I can fire 30 rounds with zero problem but when I get down to the last 10 rounds the gun will stall for like 1-2 second before it will auto fire again.

Also, I would like the ability to cycle through all my guns selection with my mouse wheel but I am only able to cycle two.
I would like the ability to weld the doors back shut once I pass through (just to get more of that movie feeling).
I've not found any problems with the AI Aliens so far. Their attacks are very good and they are fast moving. I've got to get used to my targets climbing up the wall, ceiling, under staircases, ect while shooting them. It's been awhile since I've played a game like this as I am currently playing The Elder Scroll Oblivion for many weeks now.

Overall I am well pleased with this game and would recommend it now with the updates. I wouldn't pay $19.99 for it but $14.99 I would.

--New Update--
I've played a few more hours of the game and I'm still enjoying it. The updates are working great but I did find two glitches and had to restart from a check point which wasn't a big deal. One of the glitches got stuck on where there was unlimited Xenomorphs attack. I killed around 50 before I realized it was a glitch but it raised my stats level up and I was able to keep it when I restarted from a check point.",0.02436217284776509

No auto aim, help in any way, but if you master them it makes it all the more rewarding.

And it always feels like you're doing the quest for a reason. You always need more materials so it makes it so rewarding when you beat a boss, and carve him up for materials to make new weapons, armor, and items. And with all the customization you will spend a lot of time mixing and matching armors for the best combinations to fight certain creatures.

The enemies are tough, but stick with it, learn their moves, and be patient, and before you know it it's lying dead at your feet. The level of excitement you feel, for a boss that took over a half hour and almost killed you numerous times, is amazing. Also, it takes much preparation. Fighting a thunder based creature in the desert? You will need cool drinks for stamina, thunder protection, and all sorts of healing items, bombs, traps, tranquilizers. You will soon learn that taking your time and being prepared cuts the steep difficulty level down.

This is my favorite MMORPG. That is something that a lot of people would argue, especially World of Warcraft's rabid fan base. But even though it's not as deep as WoW, the combat is so much more exciting then the typical right click of PC based MMORPGs. Get this game if you like great RPGs, with amazing battle systems.. or just get it if you love an extremely well put together game that will challenge you, and keep you playing for hours. I can't rave enough about this game. BUY IT!",0.0243157910822956
3664,5.0,"Sure God of War III is more of the same, but that's a good thing. There are better graphics, more painfully awesome kills, and a variety of new weapons/magic, but it doesn't change things up from the other two games in the series too much. Still, this is one of the most epic games ever made. Some of the level designs and boss battles are massive beyond belief, while some environments become a little bit of a letdown after the earlier stages. Kratos himself still remains one of the coolest characters you will ever control in a video game.

It took me a good 11 hours to beat, but I was taking my time. There are loads of extra features to keep you busy when you're done, from making of videos to various combat modes.

My PS3 died on me the day I got this game in the mail, so I had to wait another two weeks for my new one before I could play it. It was torture, but it was well worth the anticipation.",0.032709061872184295

3673,5.0,"RPG is not my favorite genre, and 3rd person perspective even less so.  However, I did play the first one and liked it, so I thought I'd give ME2 a try.  This one is even better.  It does tie into ME1 somewhat.  There is a large data base of information about the various species and technology so you can catch up that way.  Still, I would not say ME1 is a total waste of time if you haven't played it.

In ME2, you can customize your player by sex, facial appearance, fashion, and faction, or just skip all that and take a prefab character.  I recommend customizing because you end up seeing yourself quite a lot.  I played male in the first one and female in this.  I definitely prefer watching a female figure in the frequent cut scenes, but that's because I'm a male.  It doesn't change the game any.

Leveling up is pretty straight forward and you choose how to spend the credits you earn.  On ""normal"" difficulty, the game leads you through with objectives and goodies clearly marked on your HUD.  There is a journal where you can review objectives when they pile up and it becomes hard to remember what's next.  Squad commands are few and you always take 2 NPC's with you on missions.  However, you get to choose which 2 and level them up before setting out.  There's always many more upgrades than you have credits for.  Plus you can purchase enhancements from various merchants along the way.  It's hard to know where to invest your credits and perhaps in the end it doesn't really matter.  Like I said, this is lite RPG gameplay.

Gone is the wheeled drop ship and tedious exploration for meaningless resources as in ME1.  What remains is the Paragon/Renegade gauge; the purpose of which I still don't understand.  For those who don't know, it's a estimation of your relative goodness as measured by your choice of dialogs.  If you choose aggressive and arrogant verbal responses then your character becomes more renegade.  Conversely, if you choose cooperative and sympathetic responses, you become more paragon.  What this does to the game is unclear to me.  It doesn't seem to matter.

I should say that I have only played about 7 levels and I never play online so I can't say what happens there.  I still think there's a lot here to like for people who don't want to spend months character building as in those heavy RPG games.  There are so many great games to play I just can't see sticking with one game for more than a couple weeks.  Oh, I should also say that I'm 55 years old, which probably explains why I don't like online play.  As you get older, well, I'll just say I consider online play to be the deep end of the pool; more suited to the young and adventurous.

There are a few flaws even after the 1.02 patch.  I have gotten stuck once and the controls are a little rough.  However, it's a beautiful game and runs smoothly.",0.014281422142324396

3676,5.0,"How does a game 15 years old possibly still look great today? Well you can partly thank the indie developers who pump out ""retro style"" games on the latest console generation on a daily basis. Most of the modern retro games make my Sega Genesis look massively more powerful than the PS4 and XB1! Secondly, graphics haven't improved much in fighting games because they use limited graphics. No open world to explore, limited camera angles, it's pretty simple. They have just added more special effects and detail... and little else. So DOA 3 remains a very pretty showcase for the original Xbox and a well balanced fighting game. If you like the series, then you know this is a great game. If you like fighting games at all, add it to your collection, especially since its cheap as dirt. If you are new to fighting games, it is a good starting point for the series if you have an original Xbox lying around. Remember though, it's 1000% better with two players, but remove all the breakable objects in the room first!",0.05418780304363828
3677,5.0,"I'm semi serious about this. This game is tough. It's an excellent platformer, one of the all time best for that matter, but some of the levels are rage inducing.

Crash is the perfect mascot/icon for Sony and they let him go. At the time when Sony needed one, Crash was there and sold systems. He was the face of Playstation and it's baffling why they didn't hang on to him. Just ask Nintendo or Sega what the advantages of a mascot are. Nintendo is dead without Mario and after many failed attempts, Sega is still trying to resurrect Sonic. Crash was perfect for Sony. He's funny, has attitude, likable and recognizable and the games we're the first, really good 3D platformers for the next generation. He also provided a stable franchise for the younger audience, which every company knows they want and need. What happened here? Man, I remember the commercials when a guy in a Crash outfit went to Nintendo headquarters and stood outside with a bullhorn and was taunting Mario, daring him to come out. Classic. That was Crash. Sony really dropped the ball here.

Crash has never been the same since Naughty Dog let him get away. Other developers have made some very uninspired sequels with him, changing his looks, alliances and even voice. I know you can't do the same thing forever but none have come close to the success of Naughty Dog, when they held the reins of this franchise. Today, Crash sits in a woeful state, being made to participate in very un-Crash-like games.

This game started it all though. This changed the platformer forever. While Mario and Sonic we're still going left to right in their side scrolling adventures, Crash took us into his world with glorious 3D. It said something about the future of games and consoles at the same time and it was only on Playstation. Even today, this is a very challenging platformer. Amidst the Ratchet's, Jak's, Sly's and 3D Mario's and Sonic's, the original Crash is about as tough as there is. But it's also compelling enough to want to keep going. You never don't know how your going to get through the level (they're linear afterall), it's getting the right timing and touch to do what needs to be done. There are some truly insane levels here that will test all your patience and nerve. But you'll just want to keep trying, at least till you get to your next save point so you know you don't have to do the level again that you just did. Fortunately, there's plenty of fruit and extra lives, but your gonna need them all.

The audio, video, and play mechanics in the original Crash trilogy are spot on. These games still look, sound and play great today. They're a very few of the only original PSone games I can bare to look at, let alone play anymore. The look is perfect with bright colors and varied enviornments and the music and sounds are catchy and perfect for each stage. These games have aged extremely well and are a real tribute to the developers at Naughty Dog.

There are a couple of downsides though. These games are really tough, maybe too tough for the average gamer or especially child. Some of this is intentional design and some I feel maybe the fact that 3D platforming was in it's infancy at this time. Some of the angles on jumps, just seem a little off. The perspective can make it really tricky. Another problem is that the save points can be a little far between. Not the check points during the levels, they are plentiful and life saving, but the save points. Sometimes, I just wanted to finish a level I'd been on for a while, save and quit. But then I'd find that I had to go through another whole level and a half, just to get the bonus round/save point. And even the bonus round was tricky sometimes as it's set up as a mini level requiring you to get from one side to the other but if you fell along the way, you'd have to restart the level to get back to it. Again, more challenge and patience testing. My final complaint is that sometimes you'd have a nice number of lives you've accumulated from previous levels, say 20 or so, you save, come back and you only start with 4!!! I want my lives, I earned them!!! On a final note, I downloaded Crash on my PS3 but cant save as it wont, even though PS2 games do, so I have to use passwords. It's a little annoying but if they didn't provide them, then I'd really never be able to save.

For anyone new to Crash, looking to try it out, don't let any of this put you off. These (the first 3) are fantastic games overall. They're among the tip top in the platforming genre and are some of the most challenging but rewarding at the same time. Crash is truly a gaming icon and I hope some way, somehow, that his original developers can one day give him and us another grand adventure worthy of the name Crash Bandicoot.",0.015141796438007914

3680,5.0,"This expansion pack introduces the new continent of Outland.  This continent can only be accessed with a character that is at least level 58.  If you're either just starting to play World of Warcraft, or you have no characters even close to level 58, you may just want to wait to buy the expansion at a later time.

However, the expansion also grants you access to two new races, the Draenei (Alliance) and the Blood Elves (Horde).  You won't be able to create characters of either of these races if you don't have the expansion.  So, if you want to play one of them you'll need to get it.  If you're a new player who's just trying out the game, I'd suggest just getting the basic version and playing one of the original races, rather than spending the extra $40 before you even know whether you like the game.

You should also be warned that if you're upgrading from the original version of the game, even if your copy is already fully patched, you'll have to install the patches again after installing Burning Crusade.  This is because they printed the CDs with version 2.0 of the client you use to play the game, but they've issued patches after that which you need to log into the server (up to version 2.05 as of this writing).  If you look in the Patches sub-folder of your World of Warcraft folder on your computer, you should already have some of the patches present and be able to simply double click them to install.  If you were to try to log in before doing that, you'll have to redownload the patch before it installs instead, which will naturally take more time.

Some people have complained about lag, crashes, and lines to log into the more popular servers.  These are all short term problems.  A lot of people are very excited about the expansion, and so there are far more players than usual logged in at once, which is straining the servers.  Give it a week or two after release and it should begin to settle down.

For the basic version of WoW, the level cap is 60.  If you install the expansion, the cap is increased to 70.  If you have a level 60 character and want to continue to advance, you MUST upgrade your account with the expansion pack.

Additional level brackets for the Battlegrounds (Player vs Player areas) have been added to accomodate the new higher levels in the game.  Also, a new battleground called Eye of the Storm has been made available for characters of level 61 and above.  Additionally, around the zones of the new Outland continent, there are PvP tasks you can perform such as taking over control of towers, with the faction that controls all of the towers in a zone gaining a small bonus such as a 5% increase to damage anywhere in that zone.

They've also added a number of new instances/dungeons.  The new ones have two settings, allowing you to go through them at either 'normal' difficulty, or 'heroic' difficulty.  The heroic setting makes the enemies tougher, and provides increased treasure rewards.  This keeps the instances useful for advancement over a larger span of levels than would normally be the case.

Most players will find that, as they do quests in Outland, they quickly begin to get armor that's superior to what they've previously been using.  The monetary rewards in the new areas are also increased.  Additionally, professions have been expanded to cover the additional levels in the game and tailoring has been expanded to include specialties similar to the way blacksmithing and leatherworking work.

Flying mounts are available on the continent of Outland for those who purchase them.  However, these are not available to be used in the two original continents.  This is because those areas were designed with the intention that they would only be accessed from the ground and a lot of work would have been required to make all of the quests and visuals work as intended if characters were permitted to fly around freely.

Be cautious about buying this item used.  Each copy of the expansion includes a key code that is required to upgrade your account to allow access to the new content.  If you buy a used copy of the software where the seller has already used that key to upgrade his account, you'll still be able to install the software upgrade, but the lack of an unused key will mean that you won't be able to apply the upgrade to your account that's required to actually access the new content.

If you install the expansion on a computer where more than one account is used (for example, if you and your spouse each has your own account) then you can only use the key to upgrade one of those accounts.  The other account will continue to work, but it will not be given access to the expansion pack content.  Therefore, you need to obtain one expansion pack for each account you or your household has if you want to access the new content on all of them.

Edit:  As of January 22, 2007 Blizzard has announced on their forums that they're working on allowing players who already upgraded using the basic expansion to then also upgrade using the collector's edition in order to get the limited edition pet.  You'll have to call Blizzard's billing service line with the unused collector's edition expansion key, so it's slightly more work than upgrading directly with the CE, but it can now be done.",0.0056010051233179375

Spider-Man was even funnier than ever and the villains were okay also( but my vote for best villains still goes to the original game ""Spider-Man"" for the PS1). There are a few villains returning from the other 2 games along with some new ones(although this game is technically a prequel to the PS1 games). Meaning, this is the first time Spider-Man meets the villains presented in this game. The old favorites Shocker and Scorpion have returned and the new ones are the Vulture and(ofcourse) the Green Goblin. The voice acting in this game was great and the levels were incredibly realistic and lifelike. One of the coolest (and hardest) levels in the game is when Spider-Man goes to Oscorp and fights their ultimate weapon: the Super Mech! This robot was beyond huge! It was at least twice the size of a Gundam mobile suit! And the fact that Spider-Man was able to beat it all by himself shows just how much of a badass Spider-Man really is!
This game also brings something new that didn't appear in the other games: aerial combat!

All the levels are cleverly designed, and you can tell a lot of work went into them.  At times, I felt like some of the levels were just way too fast-paced, but hey, this IS Sonic the Hedgehog we're talking about!

The time travel element to the storyline is pretty good, too.  You can get through the main story in a good day or so, but the collectible items and achievements really add a nice touch to it all.  The only minor issue I had with the game was the final boss.  I found that level to be a little odd, and it took me a few tries to find out exactly how to beat it.  All you have to do is keep holding down the X button to boost and dodge all the debris.  When I found that out, this level became the easiest boss stage in the game.

The challenge gates are a very nice addition as well, and they keep you busy even after you beat the game.  I didn't collect all the items and pass all the challenges, though, but if you're an achievement getter, then you should definitely attempt the extra levels.

3746,5.0,"For the longest time I kept myself from playing the Lords of Shadow reboot of the Castlevania series since I originally believed I would have to play most, if not all, of the older Castlevania games in order to appreciate this series. In time, I realized that wasn't the case, and after hearing a lot of good things about Lords of Shadow, I finally took the plunge. In the end, Lords of Shadow was indeed a good game and was certainly worth playing, however it was just the slightest bit overhyped, in my humble opinion. Lords of Shadow does plenty of stuff right and actually gets better and more exciting as you go along, but there were several little flaws here and there that kind of got to me and lowered my enjoyment of the game, but only by very small degrees. You take the role of Gabriel Belmont, a knight of the Brotherhood of Light, whose sole responsibility is to serve God and punish the wicked servants of darkness. Gabriel is on a mission to destroy the ones responsible for murdering his wife, Marie, and on his journey he will face off against all manner of evil creatures including werewolves, vampires, ghouls, trolls, zombies, etc. The story for Lords of Shadow is a bit on the straightforward side, but there are some interesting developments as the game goes on, especially in the game's ending. There's actually rather limited narrative in this game, at least as far as cutscenes go. Most of the story elements in the game are revealed through storytelling narrations before each mission told by supporting character and narrator Zobek (voiced by the very talented Sir Patrick Stewart). Otherwise, the story and the gameplay do pick up after the halfway point.

Each of the enemies Gabriel faces offer unique challenges and have to be dealt with through different means. Some require careful, planned attacks with frequent use of blocking/parrying and then attacking, while others should be dealt with by hit and run tactics. The bosses are all rather challenging and fun, and the battles against some of the titan-sized enemies are actually puzzles themselves, since figuring out where and how to attack them can be kind of tough. Simple hacking and slashing won't cut it against most of the enemies in this game, as even some of the weaker enemies can prove to be a handful in large numbers and can even attack Gabriel while he is attacking them. Furthermore, Gabriel himself can be killed rather easily, especially in the earlier parts of the game when his health and other abilities are at their lowest levels. Speaking of abilities, Gabriel has a decent collection of weapons and powers available to him that make him a very potent monster hunter. His Combat Cross is his chief weapon, which functions as a retractable chain whip that allows Gabriel to attack enemies from a fair distance and attack multiple enemies at once. Its biggest drawback is that it is somewhat lacking in terms of outright damage output, however it is a fast and versatile weapon. Certain upgrades the Combat Cross receives later on in the game allow Gabriel to use it to break through certain barriers, activate wenches, and grapple onto enemies and grapple points.

The other weapon that he eventually acquires is the Dark Gauntlet, which lets Gabriel crush his enemies with powerful punches and ground slams that can be charged to increase their power. The polar opposite of the Combat Cross, the Dark Gauntlet is slow and has limited reach, but it is also more powerful. On the downside, it does leave Gabriel open to enemy attacks while he is charging it, so careful timing is required when using it to fight enemies. Furthermore, it is required to activate certain switches and move certain obstacles. Gabriel also has access to Light and Shadow Magic, each of which serve their own purposes during combat, as well as in activating devices and solving puzzles. Light Magic lets Gabriel heal himself when he attacks enemies and Shadow Magic increases the damage of his attacks. Both forms of magic also let Gabriel use more powerful attacks on enemies, such as blinding them with holy light or incinerating them with bursts of fire. Two other relics Gabriel gains are the Cyclone Boots, which let him sprint at increased speeds, and the Seraph Shoulders, which let him sprout wings to double jump. Experience points gained through killing enemies and solving puzzles provide upgrades to Gabriel's regular abilities and his relic powers.

Perhaps Gabriel's most amusing ability is being able to ride on and control larger enemies like giant spiders, cave trolls, and wargs after weakening them. Controlling these monsters proves to be unusually fun when you use them to kill other enemies, as well as necessary in order to bypass obstacles. Furthermore, finishing off weakened enemies and bosses, as well as activating devices, are done through rather well done quick-time events. Gabriel also has secondary weapons to further increase his effectiveness in killing monsters: Silver Daggers to attack enemies from a distance, Holy Water Flasks to greatly damage undead enemies, Fairies to distract enemies, and Dark Crystals to summon a powerful demon that can greatly damage or outright kill all enemies on screen. Using Light and Shadow Magic in conjunction with these secondary weapons can help increase their effectiveness. Gabriel can increase the maximum number of secondary weapons he can wield by finding Brotherhood Arks scattered around many of the missions, however most of them can only be reached after acquiring relics like the Cyclone Boots and the Seraph Shoulders, meaning that most of these upgrades can only be accessed by revisiting older missions (they're not required, but can still be helpful). The missions themselves are quite linear, but several of them have multiple paths that usually lead to hidden gems that increase Gabriel's health and magic meters.

There are a multitude of puzzles in Lords of Shadow that range from very doable to downright brain twisting; a couple of them I completed through sheer guesswork and process of elimination. Most of the puzzles can be unlocked by finding scrolls left behind by dead Brotherhood knights, although unlocking them means you will not gain any experience points (while I never used the unlocking options myself, other games I played with even more difficult puzzles would have done well to include similar options). The two DLCs, Reverie and Resurrection, add about 6 more missions that show what happened to Gabriel after the main game's first ending and how he ends up the way he does in the surprising after credits ending. The DLCs have Gabriel joining forces with the child vampire, Laura, to prevent a powerful demon known as the Forgotten One from breaking out of his ancient prison and destroying the world. Reverie chiefly consists of even more challenging puzzles for Gabriel and Laura to solve and obstacles to bypass, although there is a bit of combat as well. You even get to control Laura a couple of times in order to get through certain areas that Gabriel can't access. She plays rather differently from Gabriel and brings some variety to the gameplay. Although she lacks Gabriel's strength and weaponry, she can fry enemies with a few electric attacks, drink their blood to regain health, and even bypass locked gates and avoid enemy attacks by turning herself into a purple mist.

Resurrection largely consists of some challenging (and largely trial and error) platforming sections that are very similar to what's on offer in the main game, only with much stronger senses of urgency added in, namely outrunning rising lava pools, avoiding falling debris, and avoiding being spotted by the Forgotten One himself as he climbs his way out of his prison. There is a bit of combat as well, largely against the Forgotten One, who proves to be the most challenging enemy in the game. So, what exactly are the game's flaws that I touched upon in the beginning of this review? Well, here goes. My biggest issue with the game is the sometimes unresponsive controls. Several times Gabriel simply didn't latch onto a grapple point or vulnerable point on a boss, and even grabbing onto a ledge and pulling himself up proved challenging for him at times, even when he was right in front of it. There's also a bit of a learning curve with regards to the layout of the controls, specifically the block/dodge button. Most games in similar genres, such as God of War, Darksiders, and Ninja Gaiden, let you block/dodge with the L1 button. Lords of Shadow on the other hand has you block/dodge with the L2 button instead, which just doesn't feel natural. While this generally doesn't seem like much of an issue, I found that it slightly interfered with my reaction time. I did get used to it as I went further in the game, but it was still slightly annoying even towards the end, like a little mosquito that simply wouldn't go away. The last issue I had with the game is how a lot of missions come and go with little to no change in the story or even a single line of dialogue spoken from Gabriel, especially in the first half of the game. I've seen this happen in other games, but for a game like this where the story is supposed to be an important aspect, I felt there should have been more dialogue and character interaction in general. On its own, Lords of Shadow gets 4 stars.

The other game in this collection, Mirror of Fate, was a very different experience and, in my opinion, an even more enjoyable one. The fact that Mirror of Fate was a 2D sidescroller originally made for the 3DS had me a little uneasy at first since I really haven't played that type of genre since the days of the Sega Genesis. Thankfully, this game more than lived up to my expectations and ended up as the game I enjoyed the most in this collection. Mirror of Fate initially opens a year before the events of Lords of Shadow with the player taking control of Gabriel Belmont in a brief tutorial mission to show you the basics of gameplay; I was relieved to see that the controls from Lords of Shadow were seamlessly transferred into Mirror of Fate, in fact they were improved since they were actually more responsive. Even the quick-time events function a lot like before, only they aren't nearly as prevalent in this game. The rest of the game is split into 3 acts with the player in control of 3 different characters who go through Dracula's castle in different moments in time: Simon Belmont, grandson of Gabriel Belmont; Alucard, the son of Gabriel in vampire form; and Trevor Belmont, the man who would become Alucard. All 3 characters control very similarly and all wield their own long-range, whip-like weapons and secondary projectile weapons (Throwing Axes, Bat Projectiles, Boomerangs, etc.) to slay the many creatures of the night littering Dracula's castle; the enemies are the usual werewolves, vampires, zombies, and so on, but they're no less challenging, not to mention the tough but fair bosses. While all 3 characters have the same basic controls, there are a few differences that help make each character feel somewhat unique. Simon doesn't have any specialties, but Alucard can do things like swim underwater indefinitely without running out of air and gains the ability to climb up certain walls, as well as double jump and glide with Demonic Wings. Trevor can also climb up walls and double jump (but not glide).

Each character also gains access to different magic abilities that run on the usual magic meters: Simon can summon the Spirit of Belnades to make him invincible to enemy attacks and hazards, and he can summon the Spirit of Schneider to shoot fiery arrows at surrounding enemies. Alucard can take on a Mist Form to phase through certain locked gates and improve his dodging ability (and drain health from the enemies he dodges through), as well as take on a Wolf Form to increase his attack damage. Trevor, like Gabriel before him, can use Light and Shadow Magic to heal himself and increase his attack damage, and he also acquires Speed Boots which function just like Gabriel's Cyclone Boots, letting him run at greater speeds and jump great distances. Most of these magic abilities are also instrumental in bypassing certain obstacles and barriers, such as Alucard using his Wolf Form to break through stone doors, Simon using the Spirit of Belnades to walk through poisonous waterfalls, and Trevor using Light and Shadow Magic to activate special devices and emblems. There are less puzzles in Mirror of Fate compared to the much larger number of puzzles in Lords of Shadow, but the few that are in this game are no less challenging and will require a fair bit of time to solve.

What really sets this game apart from Lords of Shadow is its focus on exploration in the same vein as in the older Castlevania series (which I admittedly have never played). There's a lot of ground to cover in Dracula's castle, but finding your way through it is half the fun in this game, especially compared to the much more linear mission layout of Lords of Shadow. Many of the secrets in this game that you will be hunting around for are upgrades to the characters' health, magic, and secondary weapon ammo, as well as enemy bestiary scrolls. These secrets aren't required, but can make things easier, plus finding them all gives you a secret cutscene at the end of the game. There will also be plenty of moments where the characters will have to backtrack to get an important item or upgrade that will be necessary in order to continue their journeys. Thankfully, the inclusion of a few teleporters scattered around the castle help make backtracking less time-consuming. I especially liked how players can leave their own personalized notes that remain on the map as reminders to the locations of previously unreachable collectibles and upgrades. Even the story behind Mirror of Fate is considerably more grasping and interesting than the one in Lords of Shadow due to its strong plot full of mystery and intrigue. 5 stars for this great game. To sum up, if you're a first-timer with the Lords of Shadow series and are thinking about getting into it, then this is the collection to get you started.",-0.0008471603008795834

Although it is arcade perfect, it is not as good as my ol' Sega CD version.  By the way, my copy was purchased in 1992 and is still in mint condition (even the cardboard box!).

The Sega CD version of Final Fight is not only arcade perfect, but goes a step further by adding a very good CD audio soundtrack.  In addition, there's a special time attack mode where you're challenged to beat up as many bad guys as possible before the time runs out.  The bad guys come at you in droves from both sides of the screen.  I remember playing this mode over and over, always trying to better my high score.

I could go on about how good the graphics were for its day (1992), and how this was not suppose to be possible on a system like the Genesis...but ""arcade perfect"" should pretty much sum it up -- arcade perfect in every way, but with an enhanced CD audio soundtrack and time attack mode, making this the definitive version of Final Fight.",0.02232036183649087

3754,5.0,"When THQ first started the smackdown series, I have to admit that I was not a fan. Smackdown ""just bring it"" was awful. I thought I would never play another one, but I decided to give ""shut your mouth"" a try, and it was a big improvement. Since then every version seems to get a little better.

What I like most about the Smackdown games is... well, laying the smackdown. I love giving a good beating, and this game allows you to lay the ultimate smackdown. I love the hotspots: being able to slam my opponents head into the steel steps, or rubbing his face into the steel cage. Also, for the first time since ""just bring it"" you can now carry the fight into the crowd (kind of). However, the best smackdown comes in the hell in the cell. You now have the ability to throw an opponent off the cage and through the announce table. Imagine seeing the great khali choke slamming his opponent off the cell and through the table. you can do it!

Yes, there are a few drawbacks. no bra and panties matches for the divas. Also for some reason its harder to stomp on downed opponents. Many times you will try to kick a downed opponent and the kicks don't connect. Also, the commentary has a few glitches.

Drawbacks aside (and there are only a few), this is the best smackdown game yet, and I love the addition of Mr Perfect to list of legends.

However, one thing I can't understand is why THQ adds new elements to the series and takes them away, such as the pre match mini games that we got in 2006. Another great element which was taken out after ""shut your mouth"" was the after match option where you could push a button to attack the opponent after the match.",-0.008029913771656873

3761,5.0,"I started playing Hellgate: London and I couldn't stop.  This game is very addictive.  The replay value of this game is just amazing.  Everytime you play the game, the game will play out differently.

The game takes place in London, England in the year 2038.  Demons from Hell have taken over London and they live above ground.  The last remmants of humanity live underground in subway stations.  The levels you go through are always different and the monsters and creatures you fight against are always different.

Right now, I'm playing a character called Blademaster and I'm having so much fun playing that character.  You can play six different characters in the game.  You actually give your character a name and you make your character look the way you want it to look before you start playing the game.  Blademaster is an expert using different swords and shields.  You can also use one sword in each hand or a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other hand.  You can also use a grappling hook to bring a demon next to you with one hand and kill the creature with a sword with the other hand.  You make the choice of how to fight the demons throughout the game.

It was so cool to fight against demons called Blood Zombies and I actually used my sword to cut one Blood Zombie right in half.  Well the bottom half of the Blood Zombie's body kept coming at me.  It was just the hips and the legs coming after me.  I couldn't believe it.  Another time I chopped off the head to a Blood Zombie and the body kept coming after me with no head attached.  There are these jumping demons that look like mean looking dogs and they will try to land on top of you.  Well I actually use my sword to kill them while they are up in the air above me.  It so cool to see them fall down dead around you.

The graphics in this game are really good.  I don't why people are saying the graphics aren't very good in other reviews because I think they're great.  Also the demo to the game is only 5% of the full game.  The different levels and demons in the demo are nothing compared to what is in the full version game. The full version game is huge.  The game reminds me a lot of Diablo and Diablo II.  I loved those games and I love this game.  This game is definitely a five star game.  I highly recommend getting this game.  Hellgate: London is so much fun to play.",0.024758265782752132
3762,5.0,"Although there are some repeating segments in the game, this game overall is a very fun and finished product. Although you can play as both good and evil in the game, the choice system is very extreme. The good and bad choices are very very obvious in the game i.e. nothing is nuanced. The game is fun and I consider myself being a sort of average gamer at best, & I could play the game on tough all the way till the end boss. On medium and lower the game will just zip by. Overall its fun and plays almost like a third person shooter.",0.04777853725222146
3763,5.0,"PROS: If you have a full team of friends? There is no better shooter this year.

CONS: If you don't? You can't rely on strangers who may or may not talk to provide an enjoyable experience. If anything this breeds toxic behavior. So if you are a solo focused multiplayer type person. This game is an easy pass.

I have a gaming system and it isn't for everybody but I find it useful. I expect a dollar an hour for my time invested in any game (yep I have heard all the trolls in regards to the dollar an hour comparisons - so funny kek).
A game like Skyrim? I put in over 300 hours and it is safe to say I made an outstanding purchase even at 150 dollars for the collectors edition at the time. But I have also bought many games where
I lost money on paying triple A price only to manage a handful of hours. Even some indie titles I think five dollars is a great deal on a game I am mildly interested in and then I never play it even though
it is a great deal I lost money.

Enter in RainbowSix: Seige. I have been a fan of these game for years and you can imagine when I found there to be no campaign I was very disappointed. Then I looked at the price tage and scoffed. That much for a non campaign game?
Insane! Typical Ubishit tricks again. But then I looked at it differently because when anyone is overractive they are rarely intelligent. I tried to remember the campaign from the other games and I couldn't. By saying that I could not remember I mean I couldn't even remember the smallest detail of any of the other games.
The book I could easily recall but not the stories told in games. Then I started to consider how many other campaigns I beat in other shooters and I could think of very few. When you think about it? Not really a big deal. Yes people have a right
to be disappointed but it certainly isn't the end of your gaming hobby either.

Then you look at the launch price and many felt it is too high for a multiplayer only game - especially with the season pass. At first I felt the same way but after playing it I can tell you I will easily get the money to time ratio I explained above because I enjoy it.
I compared it to battlefront the ulimate edition. Then I looked at the Black Ops III deluxe edition. Both over 100 dollars, Both with no campaign or a short one and I started to realize it might seem high but it is cheaper than other offerings - outside of Halo which is a
aquired taste and only on one system. And even then it is only 60 dollars in some cases. I just wanted to get those points out of the way. All that matters is how the game is and what it offers.

Believe it or not this could be the best multiplayer shooter of the year with on big IF. You have Halo 5, Battlefront, Call of Duty Black Ops III and then Rainbow Six: Seige. Sadly it does not take a genius to figure out Christmas wise what game people will
probably pick out of that group. It is just not a household names compared to those giants.

But here is the reality. While it might not be able to compare in name. It blows all of those others away as a game. While the others seem like easy choices to make you would be wrong.
This is a real shooter and runs in the same vein as the great shooters in the past and the destructable environment is amazing. Yes battlefront has some of that but nothing like this where it is part of the gameplay and strategy. That is
where this game shines. Another amazing aspect is you really feel incentive to progress in this game. The maps are amazing. The weapons smooth the whole concept is so well done.

I'm as shocked as anyone the start of this year I thought this would be the worst shooter of the year and that you could almost bet on it. While Battlefront or Halo would be the best. Now you could argue Battlefront is the worst and Rainbow Six is
the best. Any fan of multiplayer shooters owes it to themselves to give this game a try but just know this game is unlike other shooters. It is team based. No not a team death match team. Not a zone out a lone wolf it team.
This is a team shooter where you will need to talk with other people. So it is best to have a bunch of friends who want to play this game.

The one down side to this game is just how people are in general. You throw some random stangers together to play a game and you probably won't get the best results. In fact people who are part of an organized team will probably farm teams like that
for hours on end. So if you are going to invest in the game? Do so with the knowledge you shouldn't bother if you have no intention wanting to be social. I can't exactly punish a game that requires teamwork when there are so many other offerings on the market
where you can ignore everything solo or with a friend and have fun.

3766,5.0,"I must say I am shocked at the bad reviews on these headphones.  I feel bad that some people maybe got bad ones.  I love these for gaming.  I use them on my ps3 mainly for battlefield:bad company 2 and some MW2.

Let me start by saying the sound on these is incredible.  I really can't believe how some couldn't be happy with it.  They almost had to have gotten a bad pair.  I started playing with my 5.1 surround sound system and it was good, but loud.  Then I switched to these, and wow.  They sound even better than my 5.1 system, and it's all contained so you don't bother anyone else in your home/apartment.  Playing games almost gets scary because it gets you so into the game.  It just drowns everything else out.  They have plenty of sound volume.  I could never turn them up all the way.  And I have never heard any distortion yet at even the higher
volumes for me.  The sound is very clear, and it's nice to be able to adjust each speaker on its own.  As for bass, again, wow.  I almost can't believe it's coming from headphones.

Cable length is really good too.  I keep these in my tv stand behind a door so they are hiddin.  When I play, I just open it up and take them out.  The cable easily reaches to my couch(I sit back far enough to play on a 60in tv) and I leave the decoder box right in the stand.  So that is nice.  Plus, like others said, just down from the headphones, you can disconnect them, so you don't have to take them off if you need to move around.

The microphone.  I must be doing something wrong.  I have yet to get it to work.  I actually bought a set at a local retailer and it didn't work.  Ordered from Amazon, same thing.  It crackles and pops, but won't work.  The headphones will pipe in audio from other chatting to me, and the separate volume control on there is nice for that too.  Two workarounds I have tried.
1 - if I plug the mic into the xbox 360 port on the volume controller box, that works, it's just not connected to the headset right by your mouth, so you have
  to slouch down a bit.
2 - I clip my bluetooth headset on the cord.  Use that for input, and the headphones for output.

I have a call/e-mail into support, but haven't heard back yet.  If anyone has any ideas on this, please pass it on to me.

Yes, there are some cables to deal with, but not the end of the world.  To me, it is easily worth it.  I saw some reviews saying the included optical cable wasn't
the greatest.  I already had one run so I just used that, so no comments on that from me.

P.S. I almost kept the second set instead of returning them because these are that good.  I am in the process of building a home theater/gaming room separate from my home.  I can honestly say that even when that is done, and I can game as long and as loud as I want without disturbing anyone, I will still probably use these headphones.  They are that good.

In closing, I would buy these again for sure.  Quality seems very good to me.  I read a lot of reviews before buying and there is a lot of talk on the turtle beach or the astro's.  I have never used either, so I can't comment.  But I would recommend these and would buy again for sure.  If I had a 2nd person that was over to my place even on a remotely regular basis (1-2x's per month), I would have kept that 2nd set for sure.

Edit :  I got my mic working.  As I thought, and another reviewed did too, I just didn't have it plugged in right.  You have to plug it in sticking straight out from the headset, so the little tab goes into the headset.  It is then open in there, so you can turn the mic to your mouth.  I was just nervous and I didn't want to break it.  It is pretty tight, but that is good, as it doesn't move and it works great.

I have to say again how great these are.  I couldn't be happier.  Buy these.  You will like them.",0.04098510860432318

3775,5.0,"Hi,

I am really enjoying the sabotuer.  it has really great graphics wwii style.  The heavily occupied nazi areas are a glossy black and white, while the other areas not as heavily occupied are color.  As you progress through the game you change the areas to color.

The gameplay is very fun.  Driving cars is fun.  You can drive any one and they are fun and fast to control.  You can run, jump, stealth, punch, kick, drive, climb buildings, shoot, and set demolitions.

You control Sean an Irish regular guy much like most of us.  He meets with various resistance people and performs missions.  I will not tell about the missions or story as you should experience them yourself.  Also since I am only 10hrs into it I don't know everything.  Anyway the story and missions so far are really good and fun.

The game can be quite challenging once the nazis are alerted that you are a sabotuer.  To help this you can melee attack with fists or kicking using stealth and being undetected and wear any nazis uniform.  Or you can go in blazing which is tough.  Anyway there are different approaches you can use.  You can always climb buildings.  But sooner or later the nazis are alerted and you have to go in blazing and it is quite challenging the ai is very relentless and good.  After the missions you will have to outrun the nazis or when ever you are detected and want to not be.  Then you have to either run or drive out side of the circle on the mini map that the nazis are chasing you.  There are also a lot of targets to blow up and I will not spoil any but there are hundreds if not thousands.  The map is big and there it is a really cool world.  You can map out your location when driving so you can follow a marker on the mini map that is always shown at the bottom of the screen

Also which is cool when you finish missions or blow up targets you get black market currency where you can buy weapons or cars and you can even get upgrades that will improve your abilities.

anyway in conclusion.  This is a very fun game with great graphics, a great story and characters, great action gameplay, fun driving, great controls, and Sean can do anything you would ever want a person to do.  I mean as in running , jumping, driving, etc.  Usually in a game they don't have an action you wish they did.  In this one I thought they covered all the bases for a character. I haven't noticed any bugs.  I read a review on the xbox 360 version where a guy said it had bugs like floating cars only in the first 2 hrs of play, but I have been on the ps3 version for 10hrs and not noticed any bugs.  And have even stopped playing uncharted 2 because I am having more fun with this.

I plan on finishing the review after I finish the game just wanted to give my 2 cents for up to now.

Kevin

**updated on Dec 28th 2009.

Just finished the game missions 100% didn't do hardly any free play targets.  Anyway I loved the game.  Very cool story.  Which includes the character and missions.  The missions are very varied and as the nazis get stronger you can also purchase stronger weapons.  It seems that the game is always progressing and your character along with it so while the missions are challenging, you are able with the right approach to finish them.  Some of the missions took me a few trys to get through but I enjoyed the game enough to keep trying.  Sometimes I thought too hard but just aproached it a different way.  Kinda of cool you have to think in an action approach instead of a puzzle approach.  I didn't ever wonder what to do as I think the missions are very well layed out.  You just think how to finish them without getting killed rather than what am I supposed to do.  One of the races took me all night to win.  But was super fun and exciting!  Some of the missions had so much action on the screen a lot of times I was just smiling and I was very engroused with the action.  I didn't have any time playing that wasn't exciting.  All in all the most fun game I have played right up the with mercs 2.  I didn't notice any bugs and would call this my game of the year.  Also some of the cars you can get when you start racing are sweeeeeet!

3777,5.0,"This package comes with ALL DLC MAPS, not included on disk. If you were to buy the premium content on xbox live, you would have spent $50 or 4000 microsoft points. But on amazon I paid $49 for both the premium download code, as well as a free copy of bf3, which I will MAKE MORE MONEY when selling to my friends. Heck yeah.

this game is the most realistic and diverse first person shooter I have yet to see: bullet drop, a time-period before bullet penetration, many attachments, blinding and lighting up via flashlight, as well as blinding via lasers, spotting enemies for other teammates to see enemies/enemy vehicles on their mini-map, suppressors aren't actually too quiet, the blur (suppression effect) is taken into account, showing you are being fired at, the ability to be healed by the medic class, the diverse 4 classes that define battlefield: medic (assault), recon (sniper), engineer(rockets/vehicle repair stuff), and support (LMGs, mortars, tagging devices, etc), and the way each class is beneficial during different times and places, like open places, close quarters, or near vehicles. This game really is amazing.

The single player is okay, and exciting but is not TOO intriguing for those who obsess over a perfect Halo campaign.
the multiplayer is addictive and highly competitive, but on certain maps the enemy snipes where you spawn, especially smaller, open maps.

The premium is very worth it, giving you first priority when waiting for a server to open up, giving you a head start with a few good weapons, it gives you camos for guns and your player you wouldn't normally get, and the dlc is entirely worth it.

with premium you get additional content like assignments to unloke newer weapons you wouldn't normally be able to unlock. The XBOW and FAMAS are good examples of weapons only premium members can really aquire.

overall the DLC is great, and exciting.

BATTLEFIELD REQUIRES HIGHER INTELLIGENCE THAN CALL OF DUTY. There are many more complications and realistic factors like bullet drop, destroying buildings, vehicles -land, air, and some seacraft, many attachments that get complicated like flashlights and lasers blinding you, taking fire blurs your screen more,  and more dedicated players who like to win. Younger kids would only make the battlefield experience worse. even though it ruined COD, it took the focus off of Halo and Battlefield, giving players like me a chance to gain some real competition.

Just a heads up, there isn't a battery backup or anything to run out, but because of the way flash memory operates it will theoretically only retain any given save file for around a decade.  Anytime you write to that save again it would restart the clock and give you another ten years.  It has to do with how long the memory physically retains the imprint of the save.

Folks,

I have read threads where they say this game is so much slower than the original, boring, etc...I have found this to be the opposite from *my* truth...I am seeing FRAPS in the upper 60's, whereas they were low 50's from vanilla COH. The game's graphics appear slightly better, but that may be my imagination. They have reverb sound now, which is so cool...I love the British artillery sounds.

The interface is easier to use. For instance, I now know what the potential radii of effect my mortar placement is going to be. Same with all of the arty. The map also lights up as to the range where you can fire too, and so now I can pinpoint where the enemy is (red squares), click over there quickly, and then drop the arty on them. THANK YOU Relic for making arty placement soooo much easier.

I am so happy I bought the expansion. The game runs smoother, much easier arty use, fun factions to play, love the new reverb/audio...Nicely done.

3815,5.0,"**June 2016 - minor tweak to review**

Having not read other reviews, I'm just sharing what I thought of this game.  Basically it is very possibly my favorite FPS of all time, including the PS3 and PS4 games I've played & own.

There are so many aspects I loved about Black.  You can go in guns blazing, or you can do stealthy approaches.  Head shots are clear and easy to get, unlike a lot of newer games where it's extremely difficult to drop a guy with one shot.  You can adjust each automatic weapon to either have a more-accurate single shot, a three-shot burst, or fully auto.  You can also locate suppressors for a lot of weapons, so again you can choose stealth tactics or just blowing people away.  There are more than enough different types of guns in this game as well, most are basics but they feel natural for each level.

It's remarkable how many different things you can blow up in this game, and while difficult to describe the sound of things exploding, it's somehow a very satisfying series of almost firework-sounding explosions.

Everything does what you expect in this game, and while not very many levels total, each feels unique and lasts a long, long time (a good half-hour if you're good, well over an hour if you're more methodical).  There are forests, docks, a gulag, a ruined town (you get to snipe a lot here, which is a fun & realistic weapon), and a bridge, to name a few.  There are some levels much more linear than others, but it is still fun as far as being able to have the freedom to negotiate the entire level however you want.

The storyline is exciting, though perhaps a bit generic for these days of COD and the sort.  But you are still kept in it with the action.

This was one of the most addicting and fun games I've ever played - many nights over the past few years I've turned out my lights, turned on music and my black light, thrown Black on, and just relaxed to blasting away.  After you beat the game the first time you have the option of unlimited ammo and level select, which makes it even more fun (getting a rocket launcher and magnum for most of the level = fun!).  As I said, if you're a fan of a well-conceived, good graphics, solid-plot-driven, unique-feeling FPS, then you should definitely treat yourself to this game.

Note: this is just a one-player campaign mode game, no multiplayer of any kind (which was just fine with me!).

The only other cons really for me were: there was no way to adjust the look-sensitivity, no ability to run, and no ability to jump.  However with all the emphasis on fast-paced online hyperactive/ADD/caffeinated/over-stimulation in gaming culture these days, this was a game where you do sort of move slower than you might be used to, but you quickly get used to it and just moving more methodically.  ALTHOUGH, I must say in the later levels when your opponents can maneuver faster than you can turn to shoot them, THAT gets irritating - that is where not being able to increase the look-sensitivity a LITTLE at least, would make me knock this game down HALF a star if I could, but keeping at 5 because while irritating at times you do just adapt.  The lack of jumping is not a big deal, and the lack of running only gets at all noticeable when you are backtracking to re-supply yourself.

Bottom-line: If this were a brand new game I would've been very happy paying $50-$60 for it, so whatever price it's now at I'm sure is great and well worth it.

I've read that the creator of this game had differences with EA so they won't be doing a sequel (that 'Bodycount' with THQ is the ""spiritual sequel"" but has terrible controls for the PS3), which is too bad.  The 'guns guns guns' and everything blowing up combined with being able to get clear headshots and with the large levels made this different from your current generic COD games these days that are so full of themselves that they are terrible and don't even realize it.",0.02639302041534381

The graphics and controls are top notch.  The players have facial expressions and grass even gets caught in thier facemasks.  There are even the actuall coaches who react to the plays on the field.  The instant replays are just jaw dropping.  A great addition I thought was the Madden Cards which you can use to unlock some retired football greats like John Elway and Barry Sanders.

The bullies that you beat down end up on the ground just writhing in pain. You are the main character, Jimmy Hopkins, and you have to go to class or you become truant.  You can break curfew, trespass, and earn respect with the school ""clicks.""  If you get ""busted"" several times you go to detention.  Very tongue and cheek.  Rockstar has done it again with another great game to go along with the GTA franchise.  This one is better because it can be played by younger gamers.  Bully is well worth the $[...] price tag.

3839,5.0,"Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit with Blue Switches

I love mechanical keyboards. This one has the blue type of switch, if you are a fan of the old IBM PC/AT keyboard this blue version is the clicky type you will love. The first thing you will notice about a mechanical keyboard is the weight. There is a lot of metal inside for structured gaming sturdiness and durability under intense use. This Pictek keyboard is even water resistant, but don't spill a soda in it to test that, it's not sticky sugar resistant. I'm not a touch typist but can type pretty fast and a mechanical keyboard helps me be more accurate and as fast as I can be. If you can touch type after a little familiarity time with it, your typing speed will increase a lot.

This keyboard has other special and unique and fun features. It has multiple colors as LED backlights for all the keys and even the decorative sidings are backlit. You can via some Fn key combinations set the keyboard into a bunch of different lighting effects patterns. There are also modes for different types of games and even some specific games, these and other things are all documented in the manual. This all adds up to one wiz big fun keyboard, some other gaming features include the key rollover features for multiple presses all at the same time. You can also use the included key cap puller to remove a key and replace it with some of the fancy key caps available from specialty manufacturers. If you never had a mechanical keyboard before this one is a great way to get into the action. I think this would also make a great gift for a student who needs to type reports but also wants to have some fun.

3840,5.0,"I've only done this Zumba ""game"" a couple times, but I love it so far! I read reviews about the first one not being that great (or picking up movements) so I just decided to buy this and not the first one; so far, I'm impressed! It picks up movements pretty well, and it's so fun! I love to dance, and this is perfect! It really makes you sweat and doesn't feel like a workout at all.

I've also never tried Zumba before I bought this, and it's definitely beginner-friendly. The moves aren't too hard to pick up, which is great. It took me a few tries to master some routines, but none of them were impossible.

EDIT: It's been weeks since I bought this, and I still love it! I actually bought the first Zumba Fitness after, and I have to say I think I like the second one better. The graphics are more clear, and it just seems like it's made better (if that makes sense). I still liked the first one, but I think I enjoy the second one more.

My only frustration came from my squad not going EXACTLY where I tell them to go.  For instance, I'll direct them to hide behind a barrier and sometimes they'll go in front or the side and get shot up.

3848,5.0,"This game can look super intimidating when starting out.  The setting is nerve-wracking and your character is extremely weak.  It intensifies even more when the night approaches as you are hunted by predator zombies.  Along with that, you have to loot for supplies and level up your character.  A very daunting task, but rewarding if you stick with it.

A game like this should not be judged by its story, but what it allows players to do.  Players have freedom in an open world zombie environment to discover and do whatever they choose.  Whether its just for completing missions, leveling up, finding secrets, or messing around.  The game provides all of that along with a story.  Plus you can do it with friends cooperatively.  You can even expose some of the games design by discovering ways to level up faster.  It doesnt really ruin the experience because its just one of the perks in discovering things if you dig deep into the game.

Since its a big game, there are occasional bugs that creep in every now and then.  Zombies sometimes glitch and weird things happen, but the visuals are still stunning.  The sights and carnage you inflict always leave me in awe.  If you think you can get up there, you can get up there.  When you think you are invincible, the game can still deliver the scares when it sends you into abandoned buildings walking down corridors.

My friend got me to co-op with him on this game and Im glad he did.  The experience playing together is fun and relieves most of the worries when starting out.  I recommend starting that way until you become strong or brave enough to go at it alone.  Each style offers its own fun and unique experience.  If you enjoyed the survival horror aspect of Dead Island, consider this the True Sequel.  If you enjoyed playing that game with friends, you still have the ability.  Except now, its better and heavily recommended.

Anyone looking for a deep game won't be disappointed with this title.  It takes the best elements from games and utilizes it in an open world zombie setting.  The ability to play in third person would have been nice, but this game was made for first person.  Driving will come later in the new Bonus Add-on.  Its been criticized for being a jack of all trades, but a master of none.  After playing the game, I'm not sure if that is actually a bad thing.",0.018533540905831924

3851,5.0,"Spoilers from the title of this review.  I adore every aspect of this game.
From the tone, to the gameplay, to the music..  This game exudes optimism in such a unique and wonderful way.
Only Nintendo could find a way to capture the joys of childhood, and bring them into such a modern context.

Some of the criticisms leveled against this game are that it's too linear, and too easy.  I'd say more than anything that this game is incredibly focused in its level design.  There is little to no ambiguity with regard to your objective.  The fun resides in accomplishing those goals in these levels that really feel like themed playgrounds.  That is not to say that there aren't secrets or alternate objectives to find.

Oh, and don't even get me started on how wonderful this game's soundtrack is.  The music contained within the game sets the mood in each level, perfectly.  The ghost houses are sufficiently haunting, and the Koopa/Bowser stages feel epic and dangerous.

Super Mario Galaxy is an achievement in gaming, and truly a masterpiece.  The controls, the levels, the feel..  I simply cannot help myself.

Obviously, adding this device to the Vita makes it a lot bigger overall.  However, if you're like me and use the Vita mainly at home for remote play and for carrying around the house than it is not an issue.  I find it to be very comfortable.  As others have said, the Nyko Grip feels ""cloth like"" or similar to velvet.  I personally really like how the texture feels on the grip.

This product to me does make the Vita feel much more like a regular controller (I would say the analog sticks are the main thing that hold it back, from feeling like a regular controller).  The extra battery life is just an added bonus with this product, the grip to me is why I purchased it.  I know my wife preferred the grip - as she saw the Vita by itself to be not the most comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions.

I didn't wait long to purchase this grip after buying my Vita (mostly for home use and remote play).  I know for me, this is a must-have Vita accessory and it seems like a product Sony could make money on if they made it themselves.  Sony is at least making some games like Fallout 4 have a better button layout (not using the back buttons), making this accessory even more useful.

Pros: Comfortable Overall
  Material feels good in the hands (velvet or cloth like)
  Shape of the Grip is good
  Easy to take on and off (from my perspective)
  Vita is secure while attached to the device

Cons:  Price (I personally think its worth $30, some may think that is high).
  Not as portable obviously
  Won't work with any Vita power charging stand (some people may have this accessory that they like to use)

Highly Recommend, if you want to use the Vita for remote play at home or just make the Vita more comfortable. I would compare it to the Wii U game pad, making it more like a controller.",0.054588391755981784
3876,5.0,"""Chessmaster 10th Edition"" has a nice set of classes, for people who want to learn more about chess; a variety of opponents at different levels, so you won't get frustrated or borred; and a huge variety of chessboards.  My daughter's favorite is the fairy tale animated chess board, where the pegasus Rook flies from one square to another.  The game automatically redesigns itself to suit the player's age -- for example, young beginners will receive easy enough opponents that they won't get frustrated.  The lessons are interesting, well split into small units, and sprinkled with wonderful ""try it out"" exercises.  All told, I'm thrilled.

I have a three year old computer and had no troubles getting this game to run.  Yes, you do have to put the CD into your CD reader each time, but most computer games require this, so I'm not sure why some reviewers are offended.",0.0642064720625092

3890,5.0,"After countless hours of frustration and disappointment with Ultima Online and EverQuest (although UO still retains a great deal of potential), Asheron's Call was a great relief.
One of the best features is that the  monsters aren't ""typical"" sword 'n sorcery fare. In other words,  don't come looking for orcs, goblins, giants, etc. While the bestiary of AC  obviously derives from these fantasy fiction archetypes, it develops them  differently, adding to the strong sense that one is truly in an  ""unknown world.""
AC is a bit quiet as far as ambient sound  goes. Honestly, I like that. I usually listen to music while playing and  this arrangement suits me just fine (and for any veterans of EverQuest,  it's certainly nice to not dream about that incessant and irritating gnoll  barking).
The graphics are a bit basic, but again, I find that a likeable  feature. And if nothing else, it shows that the game developers and  programmers are more concerned about the FUNCTIONALITY of the game than the  appearance. However, the environment (and most especially the night sky)  are detailed and quite stunning in their own right.
This MMORPG is also  excellent for the casual player (such as myself). Other games requiring  endless hours of sitting, practicing skills, fighting, etc in order to make  the smallest headway. AC's rewards are more commensurate with one's  efforts, and those rewards are satisfying.
AC is admittedly not for the  power gaming types, although they are there. Since I'm not a power gamer, I  feel more comfortable with the people online there and have a much better  online role-playing experience.",0.052737162794634064

3894,5.0,"In a sure sign that video games are as powerful as movies, the latest James Bond game has all the actors, all the action, all the effects - and isn't based on a movie!
Perfect for fans of New Orleans, a lot of the story takes place in that historic city of Louisiana. James Bond has the fast cars, the sexy, intelligent women, and the self assured skills that get him out of any jam.
All the actors and actresses are here, and it makes a HUGE difference to hear John Cleese, Judi Densch, Pierce Brosnan and all the other voices speaking to you while you play. The likenesses are all very accurate too, so it really is like playing a movie.
Where some previous Bond games were more like Rambo, this one is pure Bond. You get special bonus points for doing a special Bond Move where you defeat your enemies with a brilliant strategy instead of just blasting them. It's more Splinter Cell rather than Unreal II.
The graphics are great, with little spider robots, slick cars, well done smoke and fire and other atmospheric effects. You really do feel like you're in a movie and not looking at a texture-mapped building.
Gameplay is great, too. The enemies show some amazing AI in sequences. It might get a little used to the gameplay style, but stick with it. After a few hours of the learning curve (which a well done training level works you through) you will be totally immersed in this world.
Replayability is just amazing, too. You go through once to get the basic idea of the level. But then you keep going through aiming for those Bond moments, and trying to ratchet your score up by doing it quickly and accurately. If you're able to get on Platinum Level in all missions, you unlock new bonusses.
Everyone I know who has seen and played this game loves it, and we ourselves are quite addicted to it right now. There are stealth missions, driving missions, shooting missions, even ride-and-shoot missions. The cut scenes are great, too!
I definitely rate this one a must-buy for any fan of the Bond series, and for any action gamer in general. Enjoy!!",0.11097431077694235

3900,5.0,"To start off this review I'd like to say that this game will mostly only appeal to fans of Myth:the Fallen Lords and Myth II:SoulBlighter. But anyways, this RTS (real-time strategy)game isn't like StarCraft. You don't  pump out soldiers from a compound, you don't take huge groups of soldiers  and attack the front of the base carelessly and you certainly don't  ""just attack"". You start with a group of soldiers, choose who  fights in your epic battles, and then you strategicly place your units  across the battlefield. you then attack at the right time and pray to god  that your enemy hasn't noticed any movements in any sides of your  ambush. You get a wide variety of units. Most of them come straight out of  the movies, but considering there are 40 something units you'll get some  that are plain new. The story is pretty diverse and is a very good one, so  I won't spoil that for ya'. This game features state-of-the-art graphics in  beautiful full 3d worlds. Everything comes to life around you in the  battles. Sound is....well.....if you've seen the movies you know what the  sounda are ""really"" supposed to be like, therefor the game does  the sound well but if your new to Star Wars then you'll have a hard time  trying to find out why things sound like they do. Gameplay is what this  game is all about. It's downright fun. You command huge AT walkers and you  can just watch them trample the enemy while they retreat helplessly. You  can see infantry just storming outposts annihalating everything in their  way. Also the camera is fluid, not fixed. This is a game great fan for true  RTS fans!",0.037686568880425736

3905,5.0,"This game is wonderful.  Those of you who played the original MOO will find gameplay similar but with expanded options, while folks new to the series will likely enjoy the politicking and pestering that goes on in the average game.  A few general comments and then some specifics:
MOO:2 is a galatic strategic adventure game.  You pick from one of nearly a dozen races, each with its own benefits or drawbacks (The klackons, industrious space-ants, excel at production but are as dumb as bricks; ethereal Psilons float about learning with amazing rapidity but struggling to produce the ships necessary to defend themselves, while charming and wily Humans play folks against one another).  A new feature allows you to customize your own race from the scores of options characterizing the pre-packaged ones.  Want enormous planets?  Make your race Aquatic and Subterranean.  Insanely productive?  Cybernetic, Tolerant (ignores pollution effects), +2 Production.  The possibilities are staggering, and by buying a lot of negatives, one can afford an equal number of wonderful positives.
Each star system, unlike MOO:1, has a number of planets, most of which you can land on initially.  Unlike MOO:1, you will not need to learn different _types_ of colonization for different planets (radiated, barren, toxic, etc.).  However, you still need to research how to make them more fruitful.  Along the way you receive the option to hire both planetary governors and ship leaders, effectively Heroes for your forces.  Placing a good planetary leader in a system with a half-dozen habitable planets can double your empire's food, research, and/or industry production.
Other additional features such as multiple 'special' worlds guarded by nasty beasts, in addition to Orion itself, as well as the ability to purchase (eventually) robotic workers allows for great customization, and lets races rebound from setbacks.  MOO:2 even allows you the option to let the computer calculate all the fleet battles nearly instantly, so you don't have to sit through a 2 hour fight involving stasis fields and boarding parties.  However, you may only choose this option _before_ starting a given game, and cannot turn it off afterwards.  Long fights may get annoying, but I find it far more useful to know _why_ you lost, not just that you did.
All in all, MOO:2 is a very engrossing strategy game, particularly for sci-fi buffs.  Note however that while it has aged well, you may need to turn down the graphics accelerator on your computer to keep it from freezing up if you have a new one.  Details on how should be included in the help files that come with the game.",0.023969932325547297

3911,5.0,"Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 for the Wii lets you take on a massive amount of characters in fairly anime-realistic fighting. A must-have for any fan of the series.

While the game claims to have over 100 characters, really this just includes multiple versions of the same character. still, it's a fairly impressive number of characters that you get to fight with.

The Wii controller and nunchuck are both required, but they let you customize the way your characters fight. Gone are the days where you're button-mashing X X X to make a character do something. Now you're using both hands, combinations of buttons, and it feels far more intuitive. It's actually as if you are that character, blocking and fighting your way to victory.

There's a lot of space to work with. One moment you're up on a high plain, and the next moment you're down underwater, blasting away at your enemy. The large amount of space makes you feel as if you really are taking on the battle and unconstrained by artificial restraints. Sure, sometimes you run into a ""wall"" - but most of the time you're free to fly high and delve low in order to take on your enemy.

It's probably fair to say that if you're not already indoctrinated into the Dragonball Z that you might be confused. The game throws you right in with characters, situations, and relationships and expects you to understand them. But if you're a fan of the series, you'll love seeing your favorite characters and taking on battles that you've dreamed about.

Clearly this is a fighting game. So if you're a fan of fighting games, and a fan of Dragonball Z, you'll be in seventh heaven. If you don't enjoy fighting games, this probably won't convince you to convert. If you're completely oblivious to Dragonball Z, you'll probably be confused.

With those two caveats, I do highly recommend this for the Dragonball Z fans out there who want to immerse themselves in some fighting fun.",0.039385359480560704

3914,5.0,"I grew up playing Nintendo games.  My kids are growing up playing Nintendo games.  This is the essence of our joy for the Wii U, but it is not the sole reason.

First, this is not the Wii.  You cannot just buy the gamepad for your Wii.  It's a brand new system with brand new games that can only be experienced on the Wii U.  As a gamer, this is great news for me, because my Wii had been gathering dust for so long, getting no love from Nintendo as far as game releases.  I've also long tired of gritty mature experiences that could fill my time with xbox or playstation.

The Wii U came along and as a gamer I have not regretted the purchase in the 8 months I have owned it.

But I don't just consider myself when making a purchase regarding a home console.  My 9 year old and 5 year old boys are consumers in their own right, and it's important to me that they are exposed to the type of family friendly games that won't mess up their minds(too much.)

So we have great games for the kids.  Skylanders, New Super Mario U, New Super Luigi U, Lego City, Nintendoland just to name a few.  These are all games I enjoy playing as well, so it's really a no brainer.

Nintendo has been portrayed in a bad light by the media recently.  Sales for the Wii U have not been good, and it is not as powerful as perhaps many thought it would or should be.  But again, this review comes from a parent and a gamer.  The system is awesome.  It's fun.  The Gamepad is innovative and comfortable, and has lots of unique uses.  These are things no one can dispute.  If you are worried about owning the most powerful console, well maybe the Wii U isn't for you.  But for me, it's about the games my family and I like to play, and Nintendo always delivers.

The games are coming, too.

Bottom Line: Is it fun? Incredible game.  Will I keep it?  You bet.  It has infinite replay value.  Good for kids?  Well it is just fighting.  It is cartoony and fun, but that doesn't stop my kids from enacting the fighting scenes when they are done playing the game.",0.1399370709382151
3926,5.0,"So far, I've sunk in over 40 hours into this game. The difficulty reminds me of the old Ultima games from back in the 80's. Those games were tough, but if you took your time and were smart you could pull ahead of the curve.

My knight is at level 130+ now. Never playing one of these games before I did lots of farming. Clearing levels out until the enemies stopped spawning. This gave me lots of practice and experience. In total, I died 150 times before I reached level 120.

After that I ran into a couple bosses that I didn't think I could defeat. Both kept killing me, but I looked up some tips online, and victory was mine!

That is what makes this game so wonderful. When you defeat enemies and make victory yours, it feels like an amazing redeeming moment. Then you level up your character however you want and become more powerful. No matter how good you get, the lowly little enemies can still take you down, so you got to be on your toes always.

3932,5.0,"If there's a better hidden objects game than The Scruffs, I certainly haven't found it yet.  It's a good thing this game is so much fun to play because it can also be quite challenging.  The intricacies of the hidden object scenes coupled with the sometimes unforgiving time restrictions (if you choose to play the timed mode) can make for a number of failed attempts, especially as you advance farther into the game and encounter more demanding puzzles.  The overall storyline is a good one, full of interesting details - and the ultimate solution of each level actually plays an integral part in the story's progression.  For once, you actually feel as if you're searching for all these things for a real reason.  Along the way, you can also take part in a secondary game called Scribbles.  The children draw scribbles on a family photograph, and  you have to pick the most recent one - it sounds easy, but you're going to need to get at least 15 in a row on each of the 16 or so levels.  If your short-term memory isn't any better than mine, this may well become quite frustrating.  I was determined enough to finish each one, but I don't really want to hear the word ""scribbles"" again anytime soon.

With Dad suddenly unemployed and the house at risk, Grandpa Scruff surprises the other members of his quirky and charmingly odd family with the news that he has a secret that can more than save the day.  Unfortunately, the old guy doesn't quite remember the details.  It's your job to help the family discover the secret by finding valuable artifacts hidden throughout the house - and in order to do that, you'll first have to find a whole bunch of other hidden objects and solve a number of jigsaw puzzle games.  In timed mode, you only have a limited amount of time to find all of the objects on each level, and I found more than a few objects pretty hard to find.  Fortunately, Scruffy, the family dog, is available to give view a few hints (the closer you are to the item, the louder he barks), and you can get more hints by finding the dog bone hidden in each room.  Even with all that, though, it took me several attempts to clear some of the higher levels.  The artwork and design of each room is just marvelous, and they tend to be full of all sorts of objects.  You can't count on rushing through a level the second or third time around, as the sheer number of objects means you are going to be looking for a number of different things each time.  I also noticed that a few of the hidden objects you're hunting in a given room are plainly visible in other rooms, and that earns the designers of this game a few extra respect points in my book.

The Scruffs is easily the most fun and challenging hidden object game I've played up to this point, with a great storyline, beautiful graphics, delightfully quirky characters, and genuinely challenging - and fun - gameplay.

3933,5.0,"In RESIDENT EVIL 4, Leon Kennedy, the main character of RESIDENT EVIL 2, returns.  Leon is now a special agent of the U.S. government.  The President of the U.S. has had his daughter, Ashley, kidnapped and Leon is sent to rescue her.  Her location has been determined to be in a small, remote European village.  Leon is dropped off at the location by two police officers. Leon attempts to communicate with the locals but they try to kill him.  Leon survives the initial encounter, but the police officers who dropped him off meet a fate far worse.  It turns out that the local citizens, ganados (which is Spanish I believe for cattle), have been infected with an alien parasite.  Once infected the parasite eventually kills the person and takes over the body and those who are controlled by the parasites are under the command of certain ""leaders"".  The leaders of the ganados cult have very big plans for world domination and Ashley is an important key in those plans.  So Leon sets forth killing the villagers as he first finds and rescues Ashley.  It turns out that he and Ashley have both been infected with the parasite and before they can escape they have to find a cure.

The game is pretty exciting and takes between 25-30 hours to complete for an average player. It also has a lot of replay value.  Most of the time you play as Leon, but sometimes the player plays as Ashley and there are a few instances where both characters must work together.  Out of all the weapons in the main game, I preferred to use the shotgun for close range fighting though Leon also has a knife which I would recommend, in order to save ammo, using for close range fighting with just one enemy.  Enemies aren't completely mindless in the game and reveal some intelligence, such as dodging attacks, carrying shields, and joint attacks from different fronts.  In my opinion besides some of the bosses the most difficult and frightening characters to fight where the chainsaw ganados.  Those things just freaked me out and it is worse hearing the chainsaws but not seeing where those particular enemies are.  Every time I heard that chainsaw noise while playing the game it gave me the creeps.

The graphics are pretty decent, but it was the music which I found most haunting.  There were many times when Leon would commit a certain action and this haunting music would begin that gave me goosebumps because I knew some enemy was going to appear and sometimes they would just appear out of nowhere.  Something different from many other games is that you can't always relax during cutscenes.  Sometimes you have to perform actions that appear on the screen or Leon dies.

Upon beating the game, several extra features are unlocked including different costumes for Leon and Ashley; a shooting mini-game entitled mercenaries where you can unlock up to five different players; a separate mini-story line entitled ""Separate Ways"" where you play as Ada Wong and learn more secrets that weren't revealed in the game; another mini-game entitled ""Assignment Ada"" where you play once again as Ada, but on a different assignment than the one in the main game; a movie browser where you can watch all of the cut scenes from both the main game and ""Separate Ways""; and a list of Ada's files from ""Separate Ways"".

A very entertaining game that is a nice addition to the Resident Evil franchise, even if there aren't any zombies.",-0.03265246257060055

3946,5.0,"Wanna take your 360 with you on vacation or just somewhere else, look no further. While I had looked at some other cases, like the backpack, I chose the G-PAK and am completely satisfied with it.

The selling points on the G-PAK for me were the sturdy, hard case and the big outer pocket that holds all my accessories leaving nothing behind to carry. The straps and zippers seem firmly attached and the whole case feels like it's made of quality materials. There's a inner velcro strap that secures your 360 in place and it fits perfectly as well. There's plastic vents on 2 sides of the bag and a velcro flap in back that expose the 360's vents, inviting you to play your 360 while still in the case but I don't recommend this considering the 360's prone to overheating. It's a nice idea though. There's also a shoulder strap included that attaches to the sides via clips, an inner cd type holder for up to 16 discs and an inside pocket that's tailor made for the Universal Media Remote.

The only downside is that while I can fit all my cables, plenty of games, remote ad standard wireless controller, there's no room for a second controller. By the time you fit the power brick, power cables, a/v cables, controller, and battery packs in the big pocket, it's too full for a second controller. Granted, this is a minor quibble but most people play with another person. I'm kind of a lone gamer so it doesn't affect me but I know many will like to fit it that extra controller in one case.

Overall, this is a great carrying case that's fexible enough to fit most all your gaming equipment and is sturdy enough to give you the confidence to move your 360 from place to place without fear of damage by shuffling around inside the bag or being crushed by your other luggage. It's a quality case and a sound purchase which I highly recommend.",0.03611436027402415
3947,5.0,"For those not in the know, this is the Dreamcast's hype equivalent of, say, Metal Gear Solid.  The one game that is supposed to pick you up and knock your socks clean off.  And it does that, but not with constant action, fighting, or gun-blazing battle scenes.
This is an exploration game, very much in the vein of the old Sierra games like King's Quest, Police Quest, and Space Quest.  It is less of a ""beat em up"" than a ""talk and walk.""  Because that is basically what you do: talk to person A, get a hint as to who person B is and where to find them, then take a walk to find person B.  There are little diversions along the way, such as taking care of a kitten, buying everything from canned soda to little toy trinkets, interacting with the largest set of characters ever seen in a video game, and more.
The action comes in 2 forms: either TQE scenes, which are twitch reaction events that demand you hurry and press a button that appears on screen, and the other is the actual fighting sequences, where you use various moves to battle differing amounts of enemies.  The action is fairly few and far between, and you will spend most of your time walking and talking.  There is training time, but since it is not normally against an opponent, the action there is minimal.
What made this game so jaw-dropping for me was the scope of it all.  You roam from city to city, meeting dozens of different people, all with their own personalities, visiting dozens of buildings and shops, each with its own flavor and purpose, and manipulating dozens of objects.  I give the game's creator (and all-around Sega mastermind) Yu Suzuki a world's worth of credit because coordinating all of the aspects of this game must have been a nightmare!  And to think this is only part 1 of 4!
Complaints?  Well, compared to Metal Gear Solid, the voice acting in Shenmue is... well... laughably bad.  It could have really made you feel like you were living a fantastic movie, but the absolute wooden stiffness that the lines are delivered with along with their interminable slowness (""Hi...Ryo... how...are...you...today?"") really ruin the awesome sense of realism that remains otherwise intact.
The only other complaint from me is the stubborn control.  In most games such as this, up always walks you forward.  In Shenmue, whichever way you point the digital pad is the way you move.  This makes for some maddeningly uneven & unpredictable movements.  Luckily, due to the slow, exploratory pace of the game, the only place where the molasses control becomes truly infuriating is during the scant battle sequences.
But, control and translation issues aside, this game addicted me like no illegal narcotic ever could.  You don't ever want to put it down.  Every event leads to another event, with more areas to explore and people to interact with.  The game is fairly easy to beat, but a game like this is meant to be an enlightening exploration experience, not a frustrating ""do the same board 20  times just to get it right"" kinda thing.  It really took me back to an era of simpler games, with epic storylines, and expansive worlds to explore.  I had more fun with this than with almost any other game in recent memory (all the way back to Metal Gear Solid on PSX.)  A landmark achievement that will most likely be one day crowned ""Best Dreamcast Title Ever.""",-0.03982922781023837

Driving to me was such an adventurous experience that only existed in my fantasies.nI was greatly disappointed when my parents presented me with the driving simulator. They insisted that I had to get some practice on it before they would even consider letting me test for my drivers silence. I reluctantly obliged only to be amazed that I actually enjoyed the simulation. Loading the game gave me no problems with my computer, unlike most other gaming software. The graphics were simple but accurate enough to teach me the principles of depth perception. nI quickly changed my mind about the driving simulator. From my training, I nurtured responsible driving habits and mastered difficult driving drills before ever attempting them in a real vehicle. When my parents were finally satisfied that I was ready they let me take the test. Needless to say, I passed! I did not get unnecessarily anxious about driving in reality or having problems like possible gas/brake confusion. Even before I was in the driver(tm)s seat, I already had all the basic information I needed. Another unique feature of the simulator is that I could actually select different road networks for my different terrain tests. nI also learnt that the use of a driving simulator is one of the best in terms of saving costs since one did not need to hire a driving instructor. The entire training was also cheaper compared to the fees that I could have paid in a driving school for a driving license test.

3960,5.0,"SPOILER FREE!

All I have to say about this game is wow. I will be honest first and say that reviewers panned it mostly because of glitches that were experienced when first released. However, having put 40 or more hours into the game, I can say with confidence that the updates/patches have made the game what it should have been when it first came out.

So for starters, if you are new to the Mafia franchise, it's okay. It's like watching 007 movies where, you don't have to have watched every movie in the series, however, certain things will click when you see how they included it in the game. You play a military vet that comes home and due to economic issues, works with some local mobsters to get a big payoff. After some plot developments, the game takes off after that and really is an amazing revenge story with some added elements, and 1 particular plot detail that comes towards the end that is unexpected.

The combat mechanics are really on point. The shooting feels real and you can really feel the difference between the weapons that you use in the game. Heavier weapons, like shotguns and rifles, feel heavy when in combat. The driving is questionable, but that is due to the type of car that you get/steal. Faster cars, do go fast, but have a habit of losing control if you go into turns to harsh. Some of the slower cars are good around curves but if you need to be in a hurry, they might not help too much. And there are times where some missions are all the way at the other end of the map. However, what the developers did do, is allow you to have certain perks when using the 3 divisions of gangs that help your cause throughout the game.

I won't spoil anything, but you have to think about getting territory in the game. The more territory you gain, you can distribute it to the 3 gangs in the game. The more territory they possess, the more the perks they give you increase. So for example, one of them gives you access to cars at anytime. It helps especially if your pinned down and need a ride out. But you have to use common sense at times because they will deliver your car to you as long as they can access you. For example, if you are by the docks and in a shoot out and lose your enemies but need a car, they will have to drive into the docks area and get as close to you as possible. But if you are trapped off, they will deliver the car on the other side of a fence because you are in the docks, so it's always important to remember that when you go on your escapades. Another perk is having your own set of a squad come to assist you in firefights, or a higher grade of weapon availability. So it really depends on how you want to proceed. Some missions, using heavy artillery, you could complete an entire mission just shooting rockets. But again, it all depends on what you want to do.

Before I go, the last thing about this game which is amazing, is how they persistently show you how much racism existed in that time. Most reviewers downplayed it because it was either annoying or just uncomfortable for them, but I found it very effective. Most people don't want to think about reality when playing games, but, at that time, it was real, and it would have been insulting if Take 2 didn't include it in this game.

Overall, Mafia 3 is an extraordinary tale that I actually have played over. Especially the extra content expansions that came out this year, really make the game a good purchase for anyone who either likes GTA5 and wants more story behind their actions, or, someone that wants an open world with things to do.

It is built very well and the plastic doesn't feel cheap at all it (no sharp edges either) feels EXACTLY like an official N64 controller even down to the buttons. Alot of people are complaining that the buttons and thumbstick are too tight but you have to remember its new and you have to break it in first, atleast give it a few weeks of daily use to work it in.

I debated on whether to get a replacement thumbstick for $10 or get a new controller for a couple dollars more and preserve my N64 controllers, and this would also be a cheaper alternative for those wanting to change out the controller shells, the only complaint I have is a rumble pak is loose when inserted so you can barely feel the vibration and it vibrates the plastic making noise (could be fixed by shoving paper in or something), and the thumbstick sometimes doesn't respond in the direction I'm moving it due to how tight it is but once it's broken in it will be fine. You could just wiggle the thumbstick around in circles for awhile until it's broken in or use lube safe for plastics to help but I would wait til its broken in to lube it up.

3970,5.0,"Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir is a beautiful remake of the original PS2 Odin Sphere, released in 2007. This is NOT a remastered version; this is actually a remake of the original, with enhanced graphics and updated combat mechanics. The original was great; the remake is far better (and as a bonus, this actually includes the classic version as well, if you so wished to try it).

The game features an interesting, character-driven story that revolves around warring kingdoms. As the player, you control one of five characters at a time, driving them through their narrative story. When you complete the story of one character, the second unlocks. When the second is completed, the third unlocks ... this pattern repeats until you complete all five characters stories. Each story helps explain all sides of the conflict, and each new story does a great job of explaining in the gaps/holes of other stories, or giving you insight as to what happens from the other sides point of view. The events of one character might take place before the subsequent character's, or during them, or  after them (timeline wise). By the end, you are treated to an easy to follow yet complex and engaging story that unfolds beautifully.

The game play is fluid, quick, and responsive. It's basically a side-scrolling action game that boasts combo-based attack systems, spells, and RPG character leveling/skills. One unique thing about the game is that the majority of your experience comes from preparing food. While you do get XP from killing enemies, eating food is your primary source. It's easy to pick up and dedicated players can really maximize leveling up using the combine alchemy system. All-in-all, as a person who generally dislikes food and alchemy in games, I love it in Odin Sphere. In terms of combat, each character is truly unique yet still maintains similar elements. You'll start at level 1 with each character when their story begins, but the game does a good job of giving you a feel for their play style before throwing you into the grinder.

Overall, if your an RPG fan, Odin Sphere is one of those games you should definitely play. A full play through will net around 30-40 hours. The game is linear in terms of navigating you through it, though you are free to revisit battlegrounds to acquire more gold, items, and XP to power level your character. However, don't expect some large, open-ended experience. This game is not like that. I consider it a story-driven narrative with a fun and enjoyable combat system. You are either listening to characters talk, or you are killing things. There's not much in between the two.",0.03451046337299016

First off, this features impressive gameplay with awesome 3-D graphics. Heck, they've still got the squiggly outlines right; even in 3-D form ! Next, there are some great special features with no needed codes like a feature with the cast members who do the voices of the Eds and the Plank music video ! You can garner these cool extras by finding chickens in each level.

Now in this game, you play all three Eds in their neverending hijinks for jawbreakers. In fact, you can find jawbreakers if look real hard in each level. There's even a jawbreaker dispenser somewhere in the game, but you got to have a certain amount of cash on hand to get them. Playing all three of the Ed characters can be tough, but quite fun in a way. As Ed(the one with the eyebrow), you can pick up objects and throw them and using the ""Batter-Ed"" move to smash through walls and stuff. As Edd(the one with the hat), you can use his slingshot to his distant objects to make them fall, use his wit to activate machines, and use the ""Trampol-Edd"" move to go a little higher. As Eddy(take a guess), use the ""El Mongo Stink Bomb"" to stun your opponents and use ""The Tower of Eddy"" move to walk across thin walkways, sneak around, and grab high items within reach.

You can even interact with the other characters from the show, but watch out for those squirrels ! There are a couple of bonus levels that seem reminicent of the Eds' Halloween special as well as those special features I aforementioned.

Overall, this is game, though fairly short in full play, is a very nice one. Cartoon Network may not have much in video games (i.e. Dexter: ""Mandark's Lab"" for PS1, Powerpuff Girls: ""Chemical X-traction"" for N64 and PS1, and Cartoon Network: ""Speedway"" and ""Block Party"" for GBA), but they seem to have caught up now with this and a new Kids Next Door game.

He's sent in to help stop a Persian invasion. The Persians are using a giant basilisk to help. Like God of War fashion, you battle it throughout parts of the level. Similar to the Hydra in GOW1. After your battle you learn that the gods are in trouble, and the world has turned dark. You go through the Sun God's temple, to Hades, and Tartarus as some of the locations. The story is not the best of the GOW's, but it's ok. You also learn a lot about the titans imprisonment in Tartarus.

Some of the enemies are hard to dodge unlike in the previous games. Namely the panther type creature, and the
undead with the twin swords. There seems to be a slight delay for the dodge move.
You can parry in this game. Ever since GOW2 gave you the golden fleece, it's the standard for the rest of the GOW's.
Zeus's gauntlet, that you collect in you weaponry, is a close range weapon that deals tons of damage. You don't get this
early on unfortunatly, and it's too bad.

God of War Ghost of Sparta has improved much more than Chains of Olympus. You are on a search for your brother who was also mentioned in GOW1.
He was taken away, and you find out why on your journey to find him. The gods do not want Kratos to go, but of course he refuses them. You travel a lot more here than in Chains of Olympus locations. You might remember the ship level in GOW1. You start the game sailing again. A giant sea creature chases you from the ocean to even on land. Yes, another giant monster in the beginning. This one will show up a good number of times. There are many different levels here ranging from the city of Atlantis, a lava mountain, snowy areas, and even Kratos's city of Sparta.
If you've played the previous GOW's, you'll realize quickly in the game why he's so desparate to save his brother. There are a lot of reasons. There are flash back events in the game that give you a little more insight each time. The story is my second favorite to GOW2 as first.

The combat is improved here as well from Chains of Olympus. The dodge button responds good again. The twins sword enemies are back, and still have lightning fast attacks. So it's best to just keep them at a range and attack. In here Kratos will be able to arm himself with the Spartan spear and shield. You can throw spears here without selecting in a menu to do so. The melee range is not as good as your double blades, but it can finish enemies faster. The combos are somewhat slow as well. But if you put together different throwing attacks with a combination for close combat, it's a great weapon.

The developers have learned from the mistakes of Chains of Olympus, and it shows with Ghost of Sparta. The Blu-Ray disc is a buy for Ghost of Sparta alone. Chains would just be a bonus. It's still a decent game. It's really a plus going from the small PSP screen to a bigger HD screen to play these games.",0.006789546151248278
3977,5.0,"This game might just be the best game I own thus far. It doesn't have online multiplayer nor does it have offline multiplayer, but it is still very fun to play. The character Rico, while he doesn't have super powers like Infamous or Dragonball, doesn't have robotic limbs like some of the characters do in Call of Duty black Ops 3, it isn't a third person shooter like other shooting games, and while it isn't your typical action game; this game is very entertaining. I do have to mention that I have played demos to the previous Just Cause. Just Cause didn't appeal to me, but playing Just Cause 3 has been good so far. The missions are just part of the fun. Driving, flying, boating, gliding with a wing suit and parachuting are also part of the fun in this game, as well as exploding things around you, but let's not forget the grappling hook. While this is much fun, the game got even better with DLC. I'm not talking about vehicles and weapons, but new missions and the Bavarium wing suit, which made things that much more fun, being able to use its weapons and boost. While I thought to myself before finding out about and then downloading the first DLC pack that came with the season pass; why don't they have a jet pack? Well, even better, a wing suit with boost and weapons. Can't wait to see the next 2 DLC. I have to mention that I usually don't write on DLC, but this time I thought I'd make an exception.
Back to writing about the actual game, I'd have to say it is a rather challenging game, which is good so that I don't beat it too fast. The missions are fun to play, and some of the cutscenes are fun to watch, as they are pretty humorous. While you won't hear ""authentic"" gun sounds for the most part. It is a game that I would say doesn't take itself too serious, which is what I like. Some games take it too far with the ""seriousness"", but this game has something to bring to the table, showing that the characters aren't ""perfect"", they joke around with each other, the tyrant enjoys his food, they get mad at each other; some throw fits here and there. Sure games try to portray the ""humanity"" of the characters involved but this game does it well.",0.0765637789082807

While  it uses the same gameplay engine as 007, it has it's own charm.  Goldeneye is based on a movie which came from a character created in he 1950's.  Perfect Dark is all futuristic.  And this was the first 3-D futuristic game to be done right in my opinion.  The single player missions have kept me coming back for years with their well done themes, story & gameplay.  Besides blasting away at over-armored, Fancy gun totin', space dudes...the story & surroundings will engross you.  Or at least they did in the early 2000's.  And the best yet(at the time), was the fan-f***in'-tastic Multi-player!  Having 4 player death match would have been bada*s.  But the option of adding several drones to the game made it SOO much better!  To me, it's the first pre-online console multiplayer to capture the feel of current online gaming!!<--does that make sense?  What i'm saying is adding all those drones to the game made it much more chaotic, which equals more fun!!

3982,5.0,"With SIMCITY 4 DELUXE EDITION, which conveniently contains both the regular SIMCITY 4 plus the RUSH HOUR EXPANSION PACK, EA Games is really beginning to live up to their tagline ""Challenge Everything.""  Apparently, the game designers decided to challenge everything that seemed to be holding the game back in the past, and have taken a brave step forward in designing this new edition with those of us in mind who want to be able to create a SimWorld. In other words, you now have an entire continent on which to build cities; instead of having fake adjacent cities that you're forced to do business with, you now can make your own adjacent cities yourself! You can choose from any of a hundred or so ""squares"" on which you can build one city after another and have them all trade with each other and everything! You can connect them with superhighways, rail, roads, power, water; it's great!
Another major improvement is in the increased flexibility in building up each of your cities. Remember how, in previous SimCity versions, it's such a pain to figure out where to place your streets within your zones? Not anymore; each time you lay out a zone, whether it be Residential, Commercial or Industrial, the game will automatically lay down a grid of streets for you!  That saves A LOT of time right there. Also, remember how you had to blow up your streets in order to replace them with bigger streets? Now, it's a lot easier, because first of all, the road system is much better organized. For example, when you start building a town, you start by using the simple, narrow streets (which are now specifically labeled as being ""streets""). However, as people move in and your streets begin to get crowded with traffic, you can then upgrade to wider roads. Eventually, as traffic begins to overwhelm your roads, you may upgrade to wide avenues. All you need to do to ""upgrade"" is to simply drag a road along a street, or an avenue along a road and---boom!---it automatically changes to a road or avenue. No more having to demolish anything in the process!
The Rush Hour Expansion Pack just adds a new dimension to the game: now you can go out on selected ""missions"" by car, boat---even helicopter---and earn new buildings, more money, etc. for your city. Admittedly, I'm still trying to get the hang of these missions, as they aren't too easy, but it's still a cool feature for the game. Also, the buildings and airports are in much better detail now, and there is far greater variety of them. There are also many new landmarks to choose from; they are in much greater detail and there is no longer any limit how many you may place. (However, you now have to pay to place them.) There are many new rewards for being a good Mayor, too!
My hope is that with SIMCITY 5, they will make everything more 3-D and will finally provide us with the ability for a ground-level Pedestrian View; imagine being able to walk the streets and boulevards of your own cities, drive around, even take your own trains! I think the possibilities are endless. Till then, this will have to do.  But, for what it's worth, it's still a pretty darn good game!

3991,5.0,"I have been an avid and loyal fan of the Metal Gear series since it first began.  This is important to note because others like me, who have experience with Hideo Kojima's unique approach to video games, are certainly more apt to appreciate Metal Gear Solid 4, the culmination of Kojima's 20-year Tactical Espionage Action epic.  Conversely, those who are not familiar with the precepts of the Metal Gear series will most likely be lost when they pick up and play MGS4.  This makes the game ulikely to appeal to very many new fans.

However, speaking purely from a quality and fun-factor perspective, Metal Gear Solid 4 is nothing short of legendary.  Not only does the game build effectively on its storied and unique foundations, it continually innovates and inspires awe, exposing the player to new challenges and unprecedented gameplay mechanics at every turn.

STORY - Solid Snake's harrowing saga of infiltration and espionage concludes at last, putting all the missing puzzle pieces in their place.  Kojima's long, convoluted political/military plotline often confuses some, but nevertheless remains an engaging, even enriching experience to absorb and reflect upon.  Naturally, a story with so many characters and undertones takes a lot of time to play out, so cutscenes are quite lengthy at times, but they can be paused or skipped at will.

GRAPHICS - An amazing visual experience, tapping into the PS3's immense graphics capabilities, MGS4 is really something to behold.  Clods of dirt flung into the air from a grenade detonation, bullet holes in crates and concrete, crushed and twisted steel barricades, snow packing up on Snake's gear, then sluffing off in a subsiquent gust of arctic wind... all contributing to the overall sense of realism and immersion into Snake's operating environment.  The cutscenes feature amazing facial detail and expression which, coupled with the game's mo-capped acting, project believable subtext and nuance from its characters.  Kojima makes creative, yet respectfully judicious employment of motion blur and that oft-overused ""next-gen gloss"" make for a realistic, yet subtly stylized cinematic gaming adventure.  A definite milestone in the evolution of video game visuals.

SOUND - Following in the tradition of its series predecessors, MGS4 plays an excellent musical score, enhancing the action and suspense in real-time.  Additionally, players are treated with hidden music tracks from their favorite Metal Gear titles, which are added to the fully-functional virtual iPod in their inventory, and can be played anytime the player chooses.  A nice touch, especially for its nostalgic qualities.

GAMEPLAY - This is where MGS4 truely shines.  Combining frenetic combat pace in the vein of Call of Duty 4, with the methodical steath-driven strategy that Metal Gear games have made famous, Kojima adds a dash of the Sandbox concept, allowing players to choose any of a number of ways to address the challenges set before them.  Example: enemy soldiers are killing captured hostages one-by-one.  Do you slip quietly in and try to save them from their fate?  Will you creep by, and keep the mission first instead?  Will you fire on the enemy directly and invoke chaos?  All are viable options that can yield success, depending on the player's preferred playing style, and each will render a different outcome for the future of the mission.  This extends to the boss battles as well, where players can choose to hide from the bosses, striking with precision and surprise when the opportunity presents itself, or to challenge them openly, guns blazing.
Widening the player's spectrum of options is the extensive weapons and items inventory, featuring dozens of existing and concept weapons, most of which are fully customizable.  Employ anything from sniper rifles, to sleep gas mines, to missile launchers, to dirty magazines, to ramen noodles to circumvent and prevail against your many adversaries.  Capture and control enemy mortars and gun turrets.  Hold up and shake down your targets for all their items and weapons.  Send in a recon robot to survey the area ahead, or even incapacitate enemy soldiers.  Seize enemies as hostages or human shields.  Utilize your wits and infrared gadgets to track down your quarry.  Scan enemy transmissions for useful intel.  Fake your own death to baffle your pursuers.  Blend in seamlessly with your environment using the OctoCamo suit.  Ease your back problems with a warm compress.  Don a disguise to walk freely amidst the enemy ranks.  Customize your quick-access inventory.  Arm yourself with the fabled Cardboard Box...  The possibilities are practically endless, and the replay value is immense.

ONLINE - Metal Gear Online adds the dimension of competitive and cooperative tactics to MGS4's formidable gameplay engine.  Players can customize their online characters' appearance and inventory, and take their place alone or with a team to take down their opponents.  The online maps are vast and varied, where tunnels can be crawled, buildings climbed, and obstacles traversed.  As the player achieves goals or kills enemies in a particular match, more weapons and items become available to use.  Lobbies are arranged by skill level, allowing novices and veterans alike to jump in and enjoy the fray.

OVERALL - A memorable and technically brilliant masterwork worthy of the Kojima moniker, Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily one of the greatest digital triumphs in video game history.  A must-have, to be sure.  10/10",0.0055432811359227285

3995,5.0,"System Shock 2 is hard to categorize, because it blends several genres and styles of games so well. It's a Role-Playing First-Person Shooter Science Fiction Survival/Horror game, with some extra twists here and there. If you wished Half-Life was more like Deus Ex, or you wanted to play the more violent and scary parts of Thief with 22nd century firepower, this is the game you want to play.
Though it's getting a bit dated now, this game was far enough ahead of its time to still be very playable. Where the original System Shock made history as a remarkably immersive story-driven first-person shooter, the sequel goes even further with complex character development elements usually only seen in role-playing games. The graphics scale up smoothly enough to still look impressive on today's faster, higher resolution (and higher polygon count) displays, the sound is of sufficient quality to still be just as effective as most newer, more technically advanced productions, and of course, a great story is never obsolete.
Once you get into a game this immersive, you forget about the technical details that may no longer be as cutting-edge as they once were. Just turn off the lights, plug in your headphones (or surround-sound if you have it), and try to stay alive. If you happen to forget that it's just a game, this one can really scare you. Definitely not for the faint of heart.
The biggest flaw in this game is that the developers just didn't have enough time to fully flesh-out and polish some of the later parts.  Certain areas are just less expansive and detailed and finely-tuned than others.  The game doesn't significantly suffer from what's missing.  It just could have been that much better.
By far the most common complaint about this game is that the weapons break too fast.  Personally, I don't consider that a flaw.  I like the extra stress factor of having to keep an eye on the condition of my weapons.  Unlike most First-Person Shooters, your resources are very limited in this game.  Throughout most of the game, you will very rarely have enough ammo to stop worrying about making every shot count.  There are a limited number of weapons available, and if you keep firing one until it jams, you have to either expend other resources to fix it or deal with the fact that you have one less gun to work with.
If you really don't like worrying about broken weapons, there is a way to reduce or completely disable weapon deterioration.  It's not a menu option you can switch on and off within the game, but the release notes file on the CD explains how to do it, and it's not difficult.
One complaint I've heard about the end of this game is that there are two ""final battles"" at the end, and the second one is disappointingly easy.  I didn't feel that way because I recognized that the first final battle was the climax, and then when there was one more confrontation after that, I thought of it as more of an epilogue than a challenge.  This is something gamers just aren't used to, and the only other game I've played that had an ""epilogue"" after the final confrontation was Half-Life, which has been accused of having the worst ending of any game ever.  The ending of System Shock 2 isn't nearly that bad, but it can be disappointing if the relatively short final areas have left you expecting more.
Unfortunately, due to the particular circumstances of the closing of the company that developed the game, Looking Glass Studios, it is very unlikely that there will ever be a third System Shock game.",-0.036132299591698266

4001,5.0,"I purchased this game directly from Blizzard about six months ago and have really enjoyed the game.  The campaign is well thought out and keeps you interested.  Something interesting in the campaign is that there are a few missions where you actually get to side with certain sides and the mission is totally different depending on which side you chose.  For someone like me who has not played the first game, the installation sequence, which is quite long, fills you in on the story that you missed if you haven't played the first game.  Although I do not have a high end pc, I've been able to play this game on low graphics settings but I have seen many people play on high graphics settings and I will say Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty is stunning.  From an exploding Nexus to seeing a Marine getting incinerated, the graphics still amaze me when I see them. The game plays well, controls are easy and hotkeys are able to be customized making it easy to pick up and start playing. Online play is smooth and rarely do you have a problem with intense lag, but that is credited to the player not the Battle.net servers.  An achievements section is part of you profile which tells you what needs to be done in order to get the achievement - whether it's winning 1000 games as a race to simply completing all mission objectives in a campaign game.  Custom games are also available online allowing you to play user created maps and scenarios with friends or by yourself.

For those who do not have an internet connection, you must contact Blizzard in order to play the game offline.

Overall this game was very well made, the campaign is engaging, the multiplayer online mode is fun (except for the occasional cheesers) and the cut scenes are just jaw dropping.

4008,5.0,"Firstly, I wanted to spend some time with this product because this is my first Astro product of any kind. I picked this up on a black Friday sale from Amazon because I really wanted the mixamp TR, but the price was very good for the A40 headset. Before I go over my pros and cons, I wanted to give a quick background of headsets I have and how the A40 compares to those headsets. For comparison purposes I mostly used wired headsets through the Mixamp TR with the exception of using a Sony Gold wireless headset to compare just the A40 without the mixamp. The headsets I used with the mixamp are the Kingston Hyper X Cloud II's, Audio Technica M50x's, Sony Gold's, and the Turtle Beach 420x. In my subjective versus mode, I found that the A40 with the mixamp (after a few custom eqs) was slightly better than the Sony Golds and much better than the TB 420x. With regards to the Cloud II's, the mixamp really has more room to push the 53mm drivers of the Cloud II's and the M50x's simply have a more defined soundstage than the A40's. To be fair, the A40's do not claim to be a hifi audiophile headset and in turn, these game just fine with comfort, quality, and durability. Out of the box I did have to totally redo my eq settings, otherwise I would have gotten immediate buyers remorse. Here are my pros and cons in my experience with the A40 and Mixamp TR.

PROs:
*The Astro A40 TR has fantastic build quality and is much like the older A40's. The headset is modular and comes stock as an open back set of cans. Comfort is top notch as I have large ears that require over ear headsets and pads.
*The mixamp TR is the real bread-winner of this set. It can make pretty much anything sound good. If you spend some time with the Astro command center and the equalizer it can drive even hifi audiophile headsets.
*Having the option of usb chat and not tethering to the controller is an excellent feature.
*Despite the Astro marketing, the xbox one version of the Mixamp TR can be used just fine with the PS4 (sound only) using a matrix pass-through that will make the mixamp work with old consoles as well. I have it passed-through to my xb 360, ps3, ps4, and xb1.
*The A40 headset has very good stereo positional audio stock w/o the amp. With the amp and the right setup, its a real treat for your ears.
*The cloth earpads on the A40 are very comfortable and this headset is good for someone with larger ears, like myself.
*Simulated surround sound is hollowed at first, but once tuned with the eq is much much better.
*Durability of both the amp and headset seems good so far. I have put many hours into the mixamp for music and gaming with zero problems.
*The usb chat seemed to work well for me, everyone in my parties say that I sound fine.
*Outperforms any of the marketed gaming headsets out there, especially anything Turtle Beach offers, even the elite 800x (very uncomfortable).

CONs:
*The price for both items together can go from 200 to 300 dollars, which is not really a great bargain.
*Astro Command center software is finicky right now. It requires me several restarts to get to work correctly.
*The A40 headset itself does not perform up to the high pricetag at retail. I only paid 59 bucks for the headset and 130 for the mixamp. The amp is worth the asking price, but both the Cloud II's and the M50x have a much better soundstage through the mixamp no matter what preset or custom eq setting I used. I understand that people love Astro and I am enjoying this headset and amp combo, but If I had to pay the full retail, I would pass on the A40 headset and just buy the mixamp. The A40's does not match the frequency response of neither the Cloud II nor the M50x.
*Future buyers may want to invest in the mixamp without the A40 headset and use a entry level hifi headset. The pricetag would be the same if not cheaper going that route.
*The modkits to make these cans closed back with more noise isolation are very expensive at this time and Astro should give gamers the option of purchasing a closed back model at retail.

My review is based solely on my experience with many gaming headsets and I am a entry level audiophile who is learning about hifi sound. I did not detract a star for my cons because this is not something that detracts from what this combo does. If you are the type of person with the funds to spend and wants an all in one solution, then this is a very top-end, heavily marketed headset. Just be aware that the A40 headset is simply not as good as a entry level hifi headset like the Cloud I or II and certainly not the M50's. Again though, the mixamp is wonderful and drives my M50x's and Cloud II's to another level, its simply that good. I will commend that the A40 has terrific positional sound on its own and should give fps and shooter fans plenty of thrills, just be aware that the A40 headset has some limitations.

I was not given anything for free to write this review, I paid for this combo out of my own pocket to give an unbiased review of this product. If my review has been helpful to you, be sure to give me a thumbs up.",0.04069117885426643

#1Reviews - Let's get the short attention span people out the way my rating is 9.3  . This game is a real chore but that's the magic of this game. I have never had a game that made me want to spent so much time learning how my only ride at this time handles in gravel or dirt, asphalt, snow and their is even different types of each of those that have a totally different feel when driving your car on them. The Learning curve of this game is not an issue in that it's hard it's more about devoting time to playing the game because with each new car it's a whole new ball game on how it control. If your willing to put time into this game you will find it to be one if not the best racing game you have ever played. Their is no satisfaction like doing your first run up  or down a mountain clean.

Graphics: 9 - the game looks stunning put their with the best I have ever seen. From snow you rain to the mountain tops the back grounds and everything are stunningly beautiful.

Audio: 8.5 - Audio can be challenging if your not into this racing from of your co-pilot calling out what could be ahead. I give it an 8.5 because of the learning curve of the call outs which even though I have had clean runs sometimes they seem off or It actually might be me miss reading the call out or actually it could be the rating of my co-pilot. Lots of reasons why...bahaha

Controls: 9 - Controls can be good or bad depending on how you setup your car I would only use stock setup controls till you figure out how the car handles then I would adjust you controls to fix the issue that your having with it. Like if you car over-steers then I would adjust the controls the can fix that your best bet when doing this I find is a happy medium from it's starting point to what you might think you want to set it at.

Game-play: 10 - Lots of courses. Each one is totally unique to itself. Lots of variety Controls are great. Does a fantastic job of making you feel like your working toward greatness not just grinding out races. damage plays a big role in this game and it's the best I have seen. When your back tire blows out and you still have to finish the race in decent time to keep your lead is an ecstatic moment only Dirt rally pulls off .my only gripe is I wish their was more openness is some areas when you go off roads and sometimes they are very limited in these areas. I can usually get back to the road without a penalty in 90% of the race and in that 10% area it seem as soon as I got off the road it re-spawns me with out give me a chance of getting back on my own. Like I said it's a very very minor gripe.

Career: 10 - Their is actually alot here from picking your crew to setting up your cars. The story is just you playing your career and for some reason that a refreshing idea because this game is about you the racer your vehicle and the perfect run. You don't need cut-scenes that don't make sense and a story that takes away from the magic that is Dirt Rally.

Conclusion: 9.3 A wonderful game that is about you, the road, and your beast. Give this game time as in time for you to understand how to rolls because when you do you will understand what it means to having a racing game so enjoyable.",0.04535523423438865
4014,5.0,"Of all the 3D fighters Soul Calibur is pretty high up there. It has only occasionally been outclassed by certain iterations of Tekken by a small margin. Soul Calibur 4 is a ""brave attempt"" at doing some things better and changing up the formula. I suppose how well it succeeds and how abysmally it fails depends on the tastes of each gamer. Personally shameless ""Star Wars marketing"" aside I have not been happier with the franchise since Soul calibur 2.

With Soul Calibur 4 you definitely get bang for your buck. There are many characters to unlock and now certain participants are not quite as ""cheap"" and ""broken"" this time around. For example I hated Tira in SC 3 but she is oddly endearing in SC 4 both because of her new voice and more balanced less unfair tweaked attack moves. Whereas she is still quick with her lethal metal ring of doom at least she cannot dish out damage on a ludicrous scale.

It would take me a long time to go into each character individually. Rest assured the veterans from the other games return accept perhaps the oddities such as Charade and Necrid. There is a new boss (Isn't there always?) and overall though he is not amazing from a design perspective at least he is not completely unfair and grudgingly unlikable.

Questions you may have

""Does character creation make a return?"" Yes it does. As before you can unlock accessories, garments, and gear which will effect the stats of your custom hero. You can even purchase new moves! From what I've seen the ""make a character"" feature is just as good here as it was in SC 3. You can even re-dress the main heroes, villains, and heroines!

""Is there a quest for souls mode?"" No, but there is the tower of souls in which you beat conditions and meet requirements to unlock more stuff. It is a more simplistic mode like the one in SC 2 which I like. Those that liked the complexities in SC3's somewhat strategic conquest mode may feel left out however. Once again it is a matter of taste.

""Are the controls easy to learn?"" Yes which is Soul Calibur's biggest draw. Even beginners can jump right in! It should be noted things have been changed a bit. Characters now all have ""finishers"" though none of these are gory. As before Soul Calibur 4 gets the bad reputation of a button masher but in frank honesty is takes skill and finesse to truly be good at mastering each character.  In any fighting game someone can get lucky by exploiting ring outs and button tapping but I find skilled players can more often than not defeat inexperienced players.

""Are there still cheap characters?"" In any fighter there are characters that are harder to use or the power houses who seem to have the 1-up. While SC 4 is more balanced than SC 3 Yoda and Raphael's sister Amy are complete Hellions.  You also have Rock (returning from Soul Edge, the very first game) who is very slow thus it is hard to be good with him. Let's just say even Asteroth is quicker. But before you lament keep it in perspective every fighter devised under the sun and moon has this problem. Even it Street fighter well rounded characters such as Akuma, Chun Li, and M Bison have an advantage over less conventional more difficult to figure out characters such as Zagnief, Dhalism, and E Honda.

""Is there a story?"" Sad to say the branching endings in SC 3 that would unfold in different ways depending on whether or not you would hit the right buttons in time have been cut out. Every character has only 1 signature ending and the quality of each plot progression ranges between mildly decent to plain mediocre. If you have played SC 2 and SC 3 everything makes coherent sense but the game is very unforgiving to newcomers who know nothing about the series including the intricate odd relationship of Knightmare and Siegfried. Still when all is said in done at least a story exists. I've played fighters that completely gutted any semblance of a plot and the end results were usually crappy. (Such as the USA version of Samurai Shodown 5, the first release of Guilty Gear accent core, or Mortal Kombat Armageddon)

""Are the new characters worth while?"" Undoubtedly yes! Hildegard is my favorite newcomer because she is a female knight fully decked out in armor who uses a dagger for short range and a halberd for long range. A bundle of neat mythological and anime influenced characters was also done by the artist that worked on the anime series Gantz. Believe it or not their stories were actually well thought out and they did not feel ""odd"" amongst the regular veterans. Sultry Shura is a guilty pleasure and I also thought the oni ogre girl wearing beads was simply adorable!

""Why do fighting games degrade teh wimmens??"" For those of a feminist bent it's true there are bouncy boob physics and scantily clad female protagonists in SC 4. But whereas you can cut up their clothes or armor to reveal more you can do the same to the guy characters. Tell me that a shirtless Raphael or shirtless Mitsurugi do not objectify men as fantasies of desire? Let us also not forget the most  kinky hip thrusting cod piece wearing scantily clad super freak is none other than Voldo himself! (a ""male"" character)

Pros

+ Many characters to purchase and unlock.

+Controls are easy to learn.

+ While not deep at least a story line does exist

+Create a character mode returns

+Each character now has a signature finish move

+Graphics are truly amazing

+Voice acting and music are not great but definitely good enough.

Cons

- A few cheap characters exist despite SC 4's attempt to be better balanced.

-Newcomers entering the arena for the first time are going to be confused unless they wiki the back story.

-The Star Wars gimmick feels like a shallow marketing ploy. Admittedly however playing as Yoda or Darth Vader is rewarding in a guilty sort of way. If you have the 360 version like me you will have to buy vader with X-box points because he is the PS-3 exclusive character. You can however unlock Vader's apprentice.

-Females that detest scantily clad bouncy protagonist girls are likely going to crucify SC 4 without taking into account the men in SC 4 are not portrayed realistically either. All I can say is that it is a game. Have fun with the fantasies provided and do not take it seriously! Besides Hildegard is very respectful as a heroine. It's personal choice to focus on the positive or negative aspects in anything. Always opt for being an optimist!",0.010305529784921726

4019,5.0,"If you liked Sega Bass Fishing you will love this one.  The isn't for the hard-core sim player, it's arcade.  The gameplay  is simply great, even though you are confined to a ""small"" area.  The fish have great AI and some of the best camera angles.  An other great feature on the game is to earn other objects.(Different line, hats, sound tracks, fish for your aquarium, even a dog, ect.)  There is over 200 new things to get, I haven't got them all yet.
There is 5 fields; The Offing, Shallow, Coral Reef, Fishing Port, and Hide away to Big Fish.  There is not a bad selection of fishing lures and fish.  Here is a idea of the fish you can get; Blue Marin, Sailfish, Tarpon, Tuna, Mako Shark, Hammerhead Sharks, ect.  There is 13 different types of lures, each type of lure has 8 different  lures.(104 lures in all)
The graphics on the game are great all though they could of made the fish to greater detail.  The ""small"" area has very dense graphics, for example on the field ""The Offing"" there are small subs, a huge sperm whale, dolphins, ect. There is no slow down, which is very weird because of the great dense detail.
Over all this game is well worth the 20 dollars. Sadly, there is a lack to play tournaments.  But the e-mail games, mini games, and online ranking.  I've done alot of  marine fish'in and I think you should check this game out.",-0.0007848088730441627

4027,5.0,"So if you don't know the back story about ps3s, Sony basically realized they could make more money by make different versions. When they made the 60GB, they built in a ps2 which made it backwards compatible (plays ps1&2 games). The 80GB also does this but it's an emulator instead which may not play all games. Sony soon discovered that its customers could play SCEA's ENTIRE library on one system. It's not very cost effective! So they discontinued the 60GB's production claiming some sort of factory defect! Sure you can buy a new slim ps3 with 250GB of processing power, but what about all you old ps1&2 games? YOU CAN'T PLAY THEM ON A 120GB or HIGHIER! Sony is still releasing new titles for ps2 to compete with the market share of Wii, but you can't play these games on new ps3s. Bottom line: GET A 60GB PS3! SOON THEY WILL BE $500 OR MORE.

4033,5.0,"I've only played a couple of MMOs in the past and never got hooked. I played EverQuest back in 2000, and more recently I played a free-to-play MMO, Perfect World International. I enjoyed exploring the world, but after a few weeks that got boring and the weak excuses for a plot never held me. Because I got bored with the games I never got involved in the social aspect of them, either. Additionally, in Perfect World the economy is a mess because of the cash shop that keeps the game going.

I do love Final Fantasy Games, but the last one I played was FF XIII-1, and it was terribly boring and monotonous. Having heard bad things about the original version of this game, I didn't have high hopes, but when a friend gave me a beta key, I decided to try it out.

I was hooked from the introductory cutscene. The story is totally worthy of the Final Fantasy series, and the graphics are beautiful. The gameplay seems to be pretty standard MMO fare, but there is enough plot and enough variety of quest types to make it stay interesting.

I especially like that changing class is as easy as picking up a weapon/tool for that class. You level each class separately and can switch at will (there is a cooldown period during which your stats and skills are lowered after the switch, though).

Square has also done a great job of introducing newcomers to MMOs to the mechanics of playing as a member of a party and the various strategies to use against different types of enemies. This has made me actually enjoy party dungeon raids--something I had avoided before. I've gotten involved in a Free Company (analogous to a guild in other MMOs) and have loved the community there and in the game at large.

The ills of launch week are behind us. The datacenters have been upgraded to allow for more game population and character creation/login restrictions are being lifted every day. I rarely have to wait in a queue to get into a World, and then I am usually 1st or 2nd in the queue. Within seconds I'm in Eorzea.

The game is not perfect. There are still bugs being worked out, and occasionally people fall through the scenery and end up outside of areas meant for play. There are some gameplay mechanics issues that will probably worked out in the weeks to come (tab targeting is pretty unpredictable). And with a social game like this there will always be jerks in the community who ruin the experience for others. But, these aren't enough to make me not love this game.

Congratulations, SquareEnix, you have made me love an MMO and have restored my faith in your ability to create a fun, immersive game. Thanks!",0.03279356602237484

4035,5.0,"Alright, so anyone who is a Shooter fan, or even has a PS3 and or Xbox360 has likely heard of the newest Battlefield game. First of all, I noticed you can only carry three weapons. Your knife, which is always there, Your gun, and your other item. The cool thing about that is that you can grab a Machine Gun, and carry a Rocket Launcher at the same time. You can also flip various guns to give you a grenade launcher. Very cool, very cool. The basic plot is, you're a group of four ""Prisoners deemed expendable by the army"" and you're sent to serve your country instead of time in jail. Much more fun if you ask me. The story is filled with humor, which made me chuckle. I'm not going to ruin the story, so I will leave it at this. A little short, yes, but all you really need to know is you have a gun, and you have enemies. Enjoy the fun side of war.

Graphics- Great graphics. Not to the PS3's full extent, but it was for the 360 to, so you can't expect to be amazing. They kept the graphics at the same level throughout the whole game. It made it more realistic to me, and made you think you are watching a movie.

Sound- Personally, this had some great musical work in it. Mostly piano. But it always made me feel inspired to hear the melodies.

Gameplay- A shooter system that was a little changed up by the ability to shoot grenades from your gun. Very good. Only problem is that the Single Player mode is too short. Online play is solid, except that you can only do two types of battles, and the fact that you can't do a simple ""Whoever has the most kills wins"" however, the different style of online play is worth it.

Innovation- Not much different from another shooter, but it's definitely one of the best out there on the current gen consoles right now.",0.09441043138959805

I'ts best to stay to the rear of the carpet until the fire is out, then go to theleading ledge of the carpet.

And they don't have any dots or extra grip on them. I would definitely buy a similar set again, just not this particular style.

On a side note, I thought these were going to have a lot of play in them because of how they mount. Surprisingly, there's no extra movement and they don't feel super flimsy.

4041,5.0,"I must admit, when I first popped in this game, I was fresh off of playing Burnout Revenge, one of the sweetest-looking racers out there. Coming to this, I was quick to notice how flawed the graphics were. I've seen this on pc, and man, it just doesn't measure up on xbox. I know its got its 360 cousin and all, but judging by the look of the Burnout series, I just knew the xbox could do so much more graphics-wise, if only things were tweaked right. So, right off, I thought this game was gonna suck, big time.

How wrong I was.

I haven't been this glued to a game...maybe ever. Whatever this game lacks in graphics (admit it folks, it's fuzzy and it is lacking no matter how many ""advanced effects"" it's supposed to have) it makes up for in gameplay. While Burnout Revenge is great-looking, over-the-top fun, this game seems to have a sense of purpose that no other racer brings to the table. Underground what? Who cares about NFS Underground when you can have cop chases AND street racing culture mixed? Contrary to others' opinions, I find the NFSU2 rather boring and complicated with little sense of purpose. In Most Wanted, even a gamer like me can get hooked, without feeling preached in how to have fun. The best part of any racer - and any game in general - is how the player makes it fun, not how the company guides you into a labeled ""fun"" situation. I think game makers are forgetting that, as imagination has taken a backseat to technology. Games like Most Wanted harken back to the days of High Stakes and Hot Pursuit, where there was general guidance but high emphasis on mere setup - you, the racer, were the only one limiting your fun when a cop showed up on radar. I can still remember on Hot Pursuit doing aerial spins over befuddled cop cars on the raised Atlantic track. Not very realistic, but still, very fun.

And the same fun is had here. Nothing is overly realistic, even though complicated car handling is introduced in an attempt to simulate realism (although the skidding and sliding all over the place can become tiresome), even if others will argue it is true-to-life. Then again, those people would have argued the original NFS was true to life, and, well...

Anyway, this game is fun. Simple, fantasy-filling fun. I mean, who wouldn't like to spend the day in the life of a street racer? Apparently many, judging by the success of The Fast and the Furious movie. Well, be ready to live that action here, and experience the raw fun of racing and cop-evasion in one totally immersive package. You even get actors to play in FMVs for you, helping to bring this all to life (complain about the cheesy-ness if you will, but I find the little movie and phone call extras enjoyable).

Overall, this game brings the goods. It has addictive gameplay, an actually immersive story, great cars, and a sweet soundtrack. It only lacks in graphics, and, some might say, ease of control...but still, I cannot deny the long hours I spent glued to this game, giving my beloved Burnout series a much needed rest.

4045,5.0,"while I loved Persona 3 and the past titles in the series I am really happy to see Atlus bringing out remakes of great titles with extra content.
persona 3 SE had an art book, and a music soundtrack from the game.
while none of those things are here, we have a plethera of new additions such as New Personas, The Epilogue Chapter (which plays like a game in itself where you are the the protagonist, (Aigis), leave behind most of the really cool school elements for this and get more dungeon exploration aspect. it works well for this game with hours of added gameplay and content. 70+ hours in Persona 3 (yes comes with it unaltered, other then new personas, Events and Hard Mode) Plus the Extra  NEW Chapter ""The Answer"" with 30+ extra hours of gameplay for a total of 100 Hours of gameplay!!!
 this a must have for persona 3 fans that may or may not have persona 3 SE or are thinking about FES well, think no more! FES at a mere release price of 29.99 makes this package a true deal for newcomers to the persona games and to veterans alike. Veterans I recommend a rental if you have SE unless a HUGE fan and have to have it but for fans Grab this title NOW! before it is out of print!
I must also point out that while this game does a great job with the school aspects of the gameplay and while not as interesting (or annoying depending on your point of view) as they are in bully where each class is a mini game, here we see only a single question needing an answer and a correct one givin raises a stat such as charm or academics. I liked the way they didn't bog down the game with the school aspect and slowly lure you into battle. the old school turn based battles feel a little fresher here with the strength/weakness system of combat. I really am impressed with this title and would recommend it to every RPG fan out there.

Graphics: anime style flair and Excellent artwork 5 Stars.

Sound: unusual techno metal soundtrack cool sound effects Excellent Voice Acting 5 stars.

Overall: a blast from the first time you see the persona gun go off and your persona comes forth, you will be hooked into this game like me and I Strongly recommend looking into the rest of the series. with all the bonus content I can not help but Give this title 5 Stars! (sad No soundtrack this time)

4062,5.0,"I LOVE THIS MOUSE!!! This is the single greatest gaming mouse I have ever had. The side buttons are easy to use and once you get used to the size of the mouse, they become just another part of your routine. Technically, this thing has 18 buttons:

We will start with the obvious 12 buttons on the side that you hit with your thumb. These buttons are handy for hotkeys in games and other programs. They don't replace the horizontal number buttons across the top of your keyboard but work in conjunction with them; making certain tasks much easier. I found out completely by accident the other day that the side numbers on the mouse work while watching youtube as well. press any button and you can jump around in the video. For instance - If you open a video and press 5, it will jump the cue mark ahead in the video. If you press 1 again, it will move that cue back to the beginning of the video.

Beyond those 12, we have the left and right click buttons along with the wheel in the center. Directly behind the wheel there are 2 little buttons that adjust the mouse's sensitivity allowing you the user to customize the way you interact with your computer. The last button, number 18 is directly to the left of the left mouse button. It is a tiny little button and can highlight an entire page of text without moving your mouse. Very nice feature to have handy.

UPDATE: Tomorrow (Dec. 3, 2016) will be 2 years since I ordered this mouse. I use it everyday. It is an absolute delight to use. I would give this thing 10 stars if I could. It is extremely comfortable in my hand. It works flawlessly on almost any surface I put it on (there are exceptions). After 2 years the lights are still as bright and vibrant as they were the day I plugged it in. I expected some wear and tear over time as I am an avid gamer and use this mouse in countless programs. Every button still works like the day it arrived. the DPI sensor still works like a charm.

Bottom line: This mouse, the ""UtechSmart Venus 16400 DPI High Precision Laser MMO Gaming Mouse"" is bomb-proof. I may buy one more just to have incase this one dies sometime in the next twenty years.",0.08121980899758678

4065,5.0,"Videogames must be rated against genre, not against the sum of videogames as a whole.  Last Blade 2 excels in deep 2D-fighter gameplay, thematic atmosphere, and unique execution.  There is no doubt that to the casual observer it resembles an SNES game, and if Dreamcast-caliber, fully-optimized 3D graphics are a must, you shouldt pass on this game.  Pretty simple.  But don't pass on it as ""just another fighting game"".  That would be a mistake.
Last Blade 2 is a refreshing break from the very-popular 2D Street Fighter games (two of which I own), featuring sword and other weapons mixed with a more deliberate and strategic pacing.  Instead of 6 buttons, there are 3 attack buttons (1 kick and 2 slash/punch) and a Repel button.  Yet within this control system is as much or even MORE depth than the 6-button fighters.  Add in 3 pleasantly unique ""styles"" to choose for each of the 16+ characters (""Power"", ""Speed"", ""EX"") and this is a great fighting (and slashing!) game.
Better yet, if like me many of your friends can't handle much more than arcade racers and Ms. Pac-Man, there is a nice single-player Story mode here, with individual endings for every character.  You can even call up finished pre/mid/ending story panels in the ""Demo Viewer"" option.
The game is also chock full of ""personality"", which I'm discovering is an SNK strongsuit.  Almost every move elicits a groan, grunt, boast, or other exclamation.  That definitely could not have been done on SNES, nor on Playstation (very clear soundsamples on the DC thanks to ample memory).
Last Blade 2 deserves every bit of 5 stars for fighting fans.  Casual gamers in general probably won't care for it, as these are often driven by ""eye-candy"".  Each to his/her own, and Last Blade 2 for some.

I'm about 3/4 of the way done with the campaign, and haven't played online, though I did look at the multiplayer options and they look pretty comprehensive.

You may read some complaints about the controls, personally I had no problems adjusting, they are trying to simulate how a real soldier, loaded down with ammo and weapons turns, not the turbo turning in other games.

The graphics are some the best you will get from ANY console game PERIOD. From tracers, lightning, flags/banners waving in the wind, particle debris from explosions, shadows, it really is pretty impressive.

Cons:

Really only one - The ""loading"" lag-pop. If you've played you know what I mean. Otherwise the game plays smooth as silk. Not sure if it's because it's reading data from the BluRay Disc? But not worth deducting a star.",0.060480179597826665

4101,5.0,"Trying to top Lego Star Wars (LSW) is a tall order - and Lego Indiana Jones (LIJ) falls short.  That's not to say LIJ is a bad game, it's just... not as good.  And though this review is going to focus heavily on the negatives, please note the 5-star rating and realize I'm comparing and contrasting it to what I consider the best video game ever.

The first problem with LIJ is that they tried to make the characters do too much.  Yes, the carrying bits around added another dimension to the game, but it also made parts of the gameplay more difficult.  Since the 'B' button is used for special ability and carrying, it's up to the computer to determine which you mean - and it's not always good at that.  You may be trying to attack someone with your sword in the middle of a fight, and suddenly you're getting pummeled while picking up a hat.  That sort of thing.  The hot spots were also occasionally tricky.

And speaking of tricky!  Too much jumping at very odd angles.  I'm not even talking about the times when the camera swings about half-way through, some of the plain jumps are frustrating.  And there are parts where the area you're jumping onto is not visible when you start the jump, making it as much luck as practice to get it right.  LIJ would very much benefit from a character that can fly.  I know, it's not in the storyline, but boy did I miss Boba Fett and even R2-D2.  Bottom line: unless you're really, really good, expect to die a lot.

One final annoyance: that 'sneaking against the wall move'.  That has to go.  Seriously.  Any time your character gets near a wall they start this irritating slow slide along it, and the only way to stop it is to jump away.  Which can often get you killed.  So spend forever inching along a ledge or possibly jump to your death.  Two not-so-great options.

Even as frustrating as the game was (and it is) I still look back at the time I spent playing and grin.  It has a lot of fun little elements, from the cameos by Star Wars characters to the adorable little march the German soldiers do in 'mid-speed' mode.  It lacks a lot of the extras of LSW, like the blue canister 'challenge' mode, and it is only half as long, but it was still worth it.  If you like LSW, you'll enjoy this game as long as you aren't expecting too much.  The story modes were very solvable, and though some of the treasure chests were near impossible to find (until you got the detector!) I thought it was far more playable without cheating than most games.

The down side?  Only took 7 days to reach 100%.  And I can't get that theme music out of my head.

Now it's only how many months to Lego Batman?  And will they ever put out a Lego Harry Potter or Lego Pirates?",-0.02192311388558853
4102,5.0,"XCOM:EU is a great game. I played the original and many other strategy games in the past. This is a full, long review. It may have minor spoilers. I will cover as much as possible. I give Objective reviews whenever I can, not Subjective. I will state my personal opinions when I can. This review may be more subjective for me as I really like this game. Bear in mind XCOM:EU has immense replayability as long as you like turn-based tactical battles. The strategy base part of the game is awesome as well.

PC Special Edition
Very nice. The extra goodies (soundtrack, ringtones, screen backgrounds) are on the second disk and easy to get to. The soundtrack is in .wav format, totally useless. This game is Steam activated. I had no problem installing the game. The patch is a little smaller than I would have liked, but I still plan on using it for a camouflage shirt with lots of other game patches. The poster is very neat, and the art book is hardcover, although small. Overall, the SE Edition is quite nice.

Graphics
They look terrific! Only a few minor glitches here or there. The Deco DLC is awesome, not yet available as of this writing (it was a preorder bonus).

Sound
The sound is good, with voices for the soldiers. The music is not as eerie as in the original game, but it is still very good. When aliens are being fought the music picks up for the action. Very nice sound.

Early thoughts
The base is very cool, and tactical is as good as ever. Bear in mind, the official Strategy Guide is NOT going to give tactical training! You need to become a good player by playing and figuring out the strategies, that is why it is called a STRATEGY Game. I will give a few tips where I can. I beat this game in two days, took roughly 24 hours, and I missed a lot of sleep.

Difficulty - Easy/Normal or Classic/Impossible?
If you are new to this type of game, and especially to XCOM in general, I suggest at least Easy mode. On Easy mode there will be less threat to deal with and more special missions to help you. Also, the alien timetable will be a little longer, so you will have an extra monther or so before fighting the toughest monsters. Aliens are not easier to fight though, they have the same health and stats as Normal mode.

On Normal mode it took me 8 game months to win. I lost one country early on, Germany, mainly because South Africa asked for a Satellite they really did not need. Normal mode is just that, nothing differrent. This level of difficulty is the most fun in my opinion. (Actually, I prefer Classic mode now!)

Classic and Imposiible difficulties really crank up the action. More enemies in missions and all the aliens get upgraded. Most get +10 Aim (they hit you easier), +10 Defense (-10 for you to hit them), and extra health. Even Thin Men will have 4 health, not 3. This means Grenades are no longer 100% to get kills. Less starting funds, Start with only one base facility (Satellite Uplink), More enemies, countries give fewer scientists/engineers.

Accessory slot
You get one accessory slot. The Support soldier can eventually have two. What should you bring to the battle? Early on you have no choice - Grenades. Useful especially if you are new to XCOM style tactical battle. To be honest, this is the ONLY time I use grenades.

Scope or Grenade or Nano-fiber/Chitin Armor?
Scope. Scope. Scope! Once you get the Scope, you should seriously think about all soldiers having one. Nano-fiber armor gives +2 armor, VERY useful early in the campaign when you only have Body armor (+1 armor), as Nano-Fiber's +2 gives a total of +3 armor and -may- keep a soldier out of the infirmary when hit by Sectoid/Thin Man pistol fire, although critical hits may still happen. Chitin armor is rare to acquire, and I use it on Assault soldiers. With the best standard armor and Chitin armor my Assault can have 9 life + 14 armor, which when combined with the Assault's Extra Conditioning skill will give a total of 27 health in combat.

Scope or Mind Shield?
Mind Shields are hard to get and thus rare, but take them in the Final Mission for your low-Will soldiers as much as possible.

Early Moves
Early in the game you need to concentrate on gettng as many satellites up as possible. This will hopefully lower Alert levels in the country the satellite is deployed and will increase your monthly income. Countries covered will also give scientists and/or engineers per month. When deploying satellites, alert levels are Top Priority, not the continent or credit bonus of the country. Save your satellites until near the end of the month to help respond to Alien alert activity. This is very important as it will allow you to have the most flexibility to repond to Alert levels.

The Alien Containment facility can wait. In my opinion, this facility is best built much later in the game. It takes up energy and resources better used for satellite facilities.

Workshops are neccessary to raise your engineer numbers, but only so you can build more satellite uplinks. Laboratories are nearly useless, unless playing on higher difficulty settings, then they are useful because research speeds are much longer.

One power generator + one thermal generator + one elerium generator, placed all in a row, will give enough power for the whole game.

All facilities get the +1 bonus if placed next to each other, either horizontally or vertically.

SQUAD
My squad typically has 1 Support, 1 Assault, 2 Heavy and 2 Sniper. This is what I use but other players favor Assault more. Your squad composition is up to you.

Support
The weakest offensive unit but the most relied on for support. Eventually can have 3 Medikits. NOTE: All soldiers can carry a medikit as an accessory!

Assault
Total offense. I believe making the first enemy reaction shot miss is best, that way you can lead with this offensive tank. Can have up to 27 health, Awesome.

Heavy
I always go for +100% damage against Robots. VERY useful when facing the tough robot enemies. I also like Shredder Rocket and 2 Rockets. The capability to take 2 shots in a row is also very nice.

Sniper
I like Squad Sight as it allows me to shoot at anything the squad sees. Less useful with Hover armor, but still a good skill. Double Tap is also awesome. I do not prefer the Sniper that can move and shoot, so I take +2 pistol damage.

Tactical Battles
Stay together but not all grouped up. If you can't Dash from one side of the formation to the other you are too far apart. Use two mini-squads of support/heavy/sniper and assault/heavy/sniper (different depending on your choice of soldiers or if main soldiers are in the infirmary). When getting ready to enter a doorway, have each mini-squad stand to the SIDE of the doors, never IN FRONT. You could try it the other way but there are certain encounters that may end Very Bad. Take high percentage shots. Sometimes the game will make you miss No Matter What, that's just the way it is.

Move forward slowly! Use Overwatch as much as possible! Almost never Dash to move forward, and only Dash when near 100% certain the coast is clear. I cannot stress this enough. Tactical battles are long, patient affairs.

Use cover as often as you can! Although soldiers in full cover can still be hit, get as much defense as you can. Defensive bonuses make harder to get hit, and you need every advantage you can acquire.

Interceptors
Emp or Plasma? Well, there are two ships you will encounter that are Main Story ships. No matter what you do, these ships will still have a good complement of soldiers. You can always get more artefacts from other missions, squad survivability is paramount so go with Plasma or the late tech Interceptor weapon. Use the EMP until you get Plasma or Fusion.

Grey Market
Almost everything you bring back from battle is useful. Only sell useless items on the Grey Market. Do not sell corpses as almost all have a use. Eventually some can be sold. Early in the campaign it is ok to sell some things, but usually unwise. For example, in my current game I have 4 UFO Power sources and 4 Navigations left. I built several key units and have no more real need for these items. However, they would be needed if I lost Firestorms. And these numbers are for most of the game! If I had sold any of these items I would not have been able to build all the stuff I needed. Therefore, Be Carefull selling on the Grey Market!

OVERALL
XCOM:EU is a great game. I am certain I may not have included everything I wanted, but this review is very long. I hope it all helps.

4109,5.0,"As far as Im concerned this is way way better than the first Even though this is not a survival-horror (I don't see how it could be). This game would fit in the action/adventure. You get lotz of sweet weapons like the 9MM,Heavy Machine Gun,Shotgun,and the cool Rocket Launcher and(my personal favorite) the almighty Anti Tank Rifle. Ragina also gets a preety awesome missle pod. There are way more dinosaures than you can shake a leg at. On every screen there has to be atleast 2 dinos if not 3 or 4. There are about 20 dinos on here for every single dino on dino crisis 1. There are also lots of different dinos like the swimming thingers that live in the water,the Flying thingers, Ovi Raptors,Allasaures and of course the main dinos the Raptors. Even our old buddy the T-Rex is back and there is an even LARGER dino that the T-Rex fears. Every time you kill a dino you get points called extinct points that you can use to buy tools, gunns, ammo and recovery items. The replay value is great because after you beat the game you get the extra crisis mode where you get to buy dinos and battle them with a friend and every time you beat the game you get a new dino.

4120,5.0,"I play a few games regularly (MWO, lately) but have never had a gaming keyboard. I thought it would help somehow, but it's not really a great keyboard for me. I find myself not using the extra features (extra macro buttons, etc) and I prefer the design of ergonomic keyboards for general purpose. I don't want to bother switching back and forth regularly, and would prefer not to keep the Logitech software loaded at all times (necessary for keyboard features like the digital screen, changing the key color, etc). I don't notice a difference in gameplay or anything else beneficial while actually playing. After having used an ergo keyboard for a while, I still find it difficult to type on.

What I do really like: the volume control. The digital readout, which can be set to show a number of different things (at the moment, CPU and memory usage). Build quality is good, and it feels quite sturdy (significantly heavier than my Microsoft natural keyboards).

If you think you'll make use of the extra keys and features, and don't want an ergonomic keyboard, this is a good one. I'll likely be switching back to my all-purpose ergo keyboard soon, it serves me better both for gaming and office-type work.",0.049933560554101676

4126,5.0,"Compared to ""Operation: S.O.D.A."" for Game Boy Advance, ""Operation: V.I.D.E.O.G.A.M.E."" is really cool.

Oddly rated ""E10+"", it has very smooth gameplay, terrific graphics, and lots of great unlockables via secret codes and other ""special"" ways in the game. What's really neat is that I get to see a lot of the characters in a 3-D form; just like in ""Ed, Edd, & Eddy: The Mis-EDventures"".

In this game, you play as the KND operatives from Numbuhs One through Five battling every villainous villain known to these intrepid children. Not only you can get and utilize various 2x4 technology weapons like in the show, you get the other aformentioned unlockables including swell cut scenes, concept art, sneak peeks of the KND Trading Card Game, costume options for each character, boss simulations, and weapon upgrades. The key to getting these options in the ""Top Secret"" portion in the game is to collect enough Rainbow Monkeys and performing ""special"" feats in each and every level.

I like how they rendered it all together from the original show design to the authentic voiceovers from the show. It almost seems you're really watching the show itself. Apart from the somewhat brutal fighting agaist the minions and the high-flying shooter levels featuring Numbuh Two, this is one Cartoon Network game to have. That and the Eds' game, too.

No matter what console system you have, this is one game to own. And if that's not enough, an upcoming Kids Next Door DVD has some very useful secret codes for this game. Keep your eyes open for even more useful codes for the game. I know I will.",0.047947120189905046

4129,5.0,"This game is fantastic to say the least. I would describe it as chess, but much, much better. Your ""pieces"" have many more moves and options, and the story runs deep with many interesting plot twists and turns, and a bittersweet ending.
The name ""tactics"" definitely fits. I had two friends who also played and beat this game multiple times (it is worth a second go-around, no matter how long it takes) and no two players went about the same strategy. But with 18 character classes (each character can have a primary and secondary class), you have the variety to tailor the game to your unique strategy.
Power's your thing? Go with Knights, Monks and Ninjas. Distance/finesse gamer? Go with Archers, Summoners and Wizards. Feeling eclectic? Dancers, Bards and Mimes, then. Each character class has a unique set of abilities that you learn on a ""job class"" system that rewards you for acting in battle.
The one BIG warning I have is that the learning curve is rather steep. This is a game that rewards patience and strategy. Go play Duke Nukem if you wanna blow up stuff. But if you want to play what many say is the greatest strategy epic of them all, it's right here. And amazon doesn't sell it here (far as I've seen), but Tactics has been released under the very economic ""Greatest Hits"" series, so go to the store and pick up a very inexpensive, very engrossing game.

4142,5.0,"This is by far the best console I have ever owned. There are so many amazing things that Microsoft has upgraded and done right! There are also some things that could be better, but overall the console itself and its performance overall is a very good experience! I got it on launch day, so it has been a couple of weeks now. Other than some lag with the home screen after a week or so, which could be fixed by simply unplugging and plugging the console back in, Microsoft has seriously made a win towards the next generation of gaming.

The Consol:

It will be interesting to see where the console actually goes from here update wise. As of now, this xbox is HUGE! Beware, it is bigger than your 360 and not as ""sexy"" looking. Still, it is a cool piece of machinery on your shelf and while it is big, I found out the reason for its size is because of the fan. The fan takes up half the console simply because Microsoft didn't want to deal with anymore overheating issues. This shows that they care about their customers as well, because they save us the trouble of going into the Microsoft store and complaining that our xbox overheated. It should be interesting to see how this console works when it gets old. Also, good move by Microsoft on getting rid of the component cables and switching solely to HDMI.

Games:

So far I have all the games that were released at launch day except for Call Of Duty, which I will be getting soon. I can gladly say I am very pleasantly surprised at how amazingly well these games work. They look stunning on the One, and even if some games are only in 720p at the moment, they still look incredible on the TV. The controller is a good upgrade to the console as well, and basically disappears from your hand as soon as you start playing.

Blu-Ray Player

This is something that is constantly overlooked by reviewers. I put in a blu-ray disc for the first time yesterday and I was so amazed at how High Def the picture was. Blu-ray has that effect, but I have one at home and I compared it to the One and I swear it looks much better on this console. I may just be clouding my judgement towards what I want to see, but I don't think so. The difference is very noticeable.

Kinect

The Kinect is one of the best aspects of this console. I've never had a connect before, but I have used the old one and I can tell you this is a MAJOR upgrade to the Kinect. For one thing it, like the console, is much bigger than its predecessor. It responds correctly almost every time, but sometimes it doesn't even respond when I say something. I may have set it up incorrectly when I originally plugged it in, but regardless, it responds correctly 90% of the time.

The Verdict

Overall, the consol is an amazing jump into the next generation. The console will update and my opinion may change overtime, but as of right now I am very impressed with Microsoft's launch of this console. The success of this launch is something to take note of. The only downfall is the price of this console. $500 is a little much, but with all of the aspects of this console, it will be worth not paying $500 again for about 10 years. If you buy the Xbox One, you will not be disappointed.",0.045030983530009415

4144,5.0,"With the runaway success of Donkey Kong Country, Rare went back to the drawing board and a year later came the sequel. In 1995, Rare developed and released Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest for the Super NES. It was an immediate success. The sequel to DKC was bigger and better in every way possible. Better graphics, better music, brand new stages with even more variety and new characters helped catapult this game into millions of homes.

Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest plays out like this: Donkey Kong has been kidnapped by King K Rool (now called Kaptain K Rool) and wants DK's banana hoard as a ransom payment. Instead, Diddy Kong and his partner, Dixie Kong, decide to rescue him. Like the first game, you can play a one player game (you control both characters), two player game (you and another player control the characters) and two player contest (players take turns in conquering the stages.) There are brand new worlds with new stages to explore and it's all under the ""pirate"" theme as old and new enemies dress and talk the part. You'll be going through the stages collecting bananas, letters and 1ups to rack up extra lives like before. This time, you'll also collect banana coins (the game's currency), Kremling coins (special currency to gain access to a secret world) and 'DK' coins. New animals join in to help you this as well as old friends like Rambi and Enguarde. You'll also meet new characters to help you along the way as well. Save your progress when you reach a certain character and you'll need to do so often because the challenge has been ramped up this time.

The PROS: If you thought Donkey Kong Country was an awesome game, then this sequel blows it out of the water completely! Everything that made DKC great is here for DKC2 and more stuff was added: new worlds plus a secret one, more stages with more depth and variety, new Kong characters and friendly animals along with some old favorites, more stuff to collect doubling its replay value and even more codes to discover. It's also a lot harder so don't be surprised to replay certain stages more than once.

The CONS: None.

Rare went all out and produced a game that is worthy of being the sequel to Donkey Kong Country. It's easy to see why this game sold out just as quickly and had people amazed that the SNES was capable of playing this kind of game. It was another groundbreaking experience at the time and it still holds up as a fun game. You can get this game used or if you have a Wii, download this game from the Virtual Console Service for 800 points ($8.00.)

The entire premise is captivating and unfolds neatly. There are a great variety of environments and monsters throughout so it never gets boring. The controls and two handed spells/weapons are very unique and I haven't seen another like it.
Many games focus on graphics or stick close to a genre. Undying put a unique spin on the FPS and is simply one of the most memorable games I've ever played.

Now, Nintendo has given us (well, sold us, technically) the tools to do it with their blessing - on their own hardware.  This is awesome.

You can now make your own Mario levels in not one, but 4 different styles.  From the original Super Mario Bros. to the HD style of New Super Mario Bros.

4172,5.0,"I have been a fan of Half Life, so I knew I would get this for Xbox 360.  (I prefer playing games on consoles.)  I was also curious about the other games in this package.  There is one disc...when you put it in the 360 a main menu comes up with five choices across the bottom of the screen...1. Half Life 2, 2. Half Life 2 Episode One, 3. Half Life 2 Episode Two, 4. Portal and 5. Team Fortress 2.  That's right 5 games!  One disc.  One box.  $59.99!  Great deal.

Half Life 2 appears to be much better looking graphically than the original Xbox version...there are not as many glitches either.  The backwards compatible version had quite a few bugs that made playing the game on the 360 quite annoying.  Not to worry here.  The game play is smooth and quite comparable to the PC version.  The bonus here of course is that you have both Episodes One and Two to move on with after completing Half Life 2...or you can play just Episode One or Two.  You don't have to solve one to play the others.  That may be beneficial if you have played Half Life 2 and just want to jump right into the Episodes.  The graphics on the Episodes really shine...it looks amazing...they did a great job with this version.

Portal is an interesting game and quite challenging.  It seems very similar to Half Life 2 in that it is in first person, but this is more of a puzzle game.  You have a portal shooting gun, and you have to figure out how to use the device to get through a maze or puzzle.  There are a few twists on this too...moving platforms, switches, blocks, weight activated floor buttons, electrical sensor receptacles, energy emitting zappers that can activate the receptacles and later in the game this is even more complicated by motion sensing robotic machine gun turrets.  It really stimulates the brain.  It definitely makes you think outside the box.  Eventually, you get the ability to shoot two different portals...one an entry portal, and the second an exit portal.  I got addicted to this game and played for two hours straight until I became completely stuck and confused.  I had to put it down and relax for a while...I was getting a little too intense.  I can't wait to play again.

Team Fortress 2 is an online multiplayer based game.  You are set up into teams, and then there are different objectives to play.  I only played it twice, so I don't know all the ins and outs of it.  However, it does look quite interesting.  There are a few different characters to choose from with different abilities.  These abilities can make one character better at defending a base, one is better at going out and stalking the other team, etc.  There are snipers, medics, heavy weapon handlers, spies, scouts and a few others that I can remember.  This game appears to have some replay value and a lot of fun for online multiplayer.

With all those games in one box and on one disc, who wouldn't want it for $59.99?!?  This is truly the best deal in video game history.  Why don't more companies do this and release more content at one time?  This may make developers think about quantity in addition to quality.",0.030738714506202025

4178,5.0,"Let me start off by saying that I've never played the Pc version or online version. I bought this game at gamestop after it had came down in price. Every since the movie came out I was hoping they would make a game for it. While you don't get to play any of the characters from the movie, I wasn't disappointed. You play a couple of missions that takes place prior to the infamous battle of the Mog. You start by choosing what kind of squad member you are, medic, sniper, machine gunner, or demolitions expert. Then you get to choose which weapons and accessories to use. While some complain about the graphics of the buildings, I think they are good. I mean from what I've seen of actual footage of somalia, I think the designers got the look as accurate as they can for ps2 platform. You do have to rely on your squad members for health and ammo, which in real life is the case. Except of course when you get wounded in real life you're out of the fight depending onthe type of wound. Some complain about the game being too short, I however think the length is about right considering that the U.S didn't intervene as much in the Somalian Civil War. I especially like the bonus mission where you get to kill Mahommed Farrir Addid. My only complaint is that they should have upped the gore level a little bit more. After all the real event was a bloody mess.",-0.023077042782925137

4181,5.0,"I have played just about every Star Wars Game that was put out (first on Nintendo, then Playstation, now Playstation2). Most of them were enjoyable, but ""Star Wars: Starfighter"" (the latest game out of the series made for the PS2 system) beats them all. With Lucas Arts utalizing the PS2 platform, the graphics are almost realistic. For example, when you're flying through the canyons, it actually looks like they are rock you're flying past, and the characters look like something, with their crisp clean round shapes. While it is easy to get stuck upside down while in flight, it is just as easy to correct it by toggling the right-stick, OR it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the battle if you are flying in an inverted position. The story, while it falls parallel to the timeline of Episode one, is not restricted to the events of Episode One, but rather goes off on its own story. Which is good, and is only locical to think that there are other events that take place during that time. A player can play all the way through this game in just over two hours (maybe less), so you don't have to play it in several sittings and lose track of what has happened before, but in just one or two sittings. The only BAD thing about the game is sometimes if your not careful, you can get trapped under the AAT (the ground tanks) which can knock out your shields REALLY fast. All in all I highly reccoment this game for avid Star Wars fans and even if you've never seen a Star Wars movie, it won't take away from the enjoyment of the game.",0.02811217610717054

4187,5.0,"I can't explain just how much I love this game. I'm not a big sports-game person on my ps3 so I was a little hesitant to buy this title. In addition, I had not heard much about Virtual Tennis on the online blogs (when I would look up what games to buy for the Vita). When the game went on sale, I decided it was worth a shot. I started playing this game on a road trip - on easy mode World Tour and I was instantly hooked. I finished the tour in 3-4 hours.

At this point, with most games I'm done with them and never want to look at it again, but I wanted to prolong the joy VT had brought me. So I poked around the massive main menu to see what else was there to do and found the network section.  Now I should mention that I'm not much of an online multiplayer gamer and when I say that I mean I've never done it. I didn't know what to expect, but I figured I would have to jump through several hoops before even getting to play anyone online.  As it turns out it only took 2 clicks and I was playing someone. I got my a** kicked. I expected that but still wasn't quite able to accept it. I kept playing online and proceeded to loose all the matches, but I was having a blast. The online gameplay was so good that I kept wondering if I really was playing people from other parts of the world. I did get kicked off the network a few times but was back online within a few minutes. In fact, the load times in this game were so low that it encouraged me to explore all it had to offer. In any case, I got tired of loosing online so I started the tour again on the hard level. It got very hard very fast and forced me to be more strategic, which helped me win a few matches online.

I could go on and on about how much fun this game is while not even touching on the vita specific mini games (they're gimmicky, but fun for short bursts and just add to this deep title). So I highly encourage all Vita owners to pick this up - I look forward to beating you online :-)",0.015252474945317599

You get a ton of weapons and useful augmentations to help you get through the tough spots.  The controls are relatively easy to learn; the L2 button (pause to change primary, secondary weapon or aug) quickly became my best friend.  The only thing I didn't like about the game is the inability to carry med kits.  You automatically pick up the small ones and have a choice of picking up the large ones.  This means having to remember and backtrack to pick up a large med kit if you didn't want to do so earlier while you were already at two-thirds health.  Also, you have the ability to revive yourself by hitting the L1 button if you do so before blacking out.  This takes the thrill of trying to stay alive.  I'd rather die and have to restart over again.

4210,5.0,"a strategy rpg that stresses the strategy. the SRPG genre is my favorite, starting with Final fantasy tactics for the ps1. Over the years the series has become a little stale. Many people still consider FFT the best in the genre.

This game breaks some of the common SRPG tropes and makes you think about what classes you want to use vs just sticking to one or two classes over the whole course of the game.

A lot of the complaints for the game is that it forces you to use a certain class or else you can't beat a mission. this is only true for the first 6 missions or so.

Once you get to the meat of the game and have a lot more classes to play around with there are many different class combinations. I read how other played through the game and who their favorite people were and mine were completely different.

one small complaint, and every SRPG has this problem, is that at some point you are going to have to build up quite a bit to get the class skills you want.

The story to the game is enjoyable and isn't too cliche.

The graphics and music are excellent. This game has some of the best music I've ever heard in a game.

This game was released around the same time as Jeanne d'Arc and that game received much better reviews while bringing nothing new to the genre, don't get me wrong Jeanne d'Arc is a good game its just a little plain.

If you're a SRPG fan there is no reason not to enjoy this game. The first few missions never bothered me but some people didn't like them. I'd say try to push through the first several missions and the game gets a lot better once you have some options.

Is this game flawless, no, but it is underrated especially within the SRPG genre",0.01682523860155439

4212,5.0,"Mario Strikers is the second best multiplayer game on Game Cube after Mario Superstar Baseball.  Although it does have as large of a roster or as many stadiums as Mario Superstar Baseball, it makes up for it with the sheer aggressiveness of the intense gameplay.  Mario Strikers is street soccer at its finest.  The characters are well-designed with some of the best 3D modeling around.  The characters have angry facial expressions, which I am still unsure if it is a good thing or a bad thing but it is somewhat humorous.  The selection of side-kicks is only limited to four and they comprise the majority of your team with the exception of your captain; however, the side-kicks have the Mario charm and are fun.  The ability to power shots and get 2-points goals is simply fantastic.  I play this game with one of my friends all the time and we are both gamers but this game is the only game that he clobbers me nearly every time in.  He can do those 2-point goals on cue throughout the game with no hesitation and without missing.  I think he only missed like three 2-point goals in ten 10 minute games and that is because he was not paying attention or even trying at those times.  It is unreal.  I wonder if he has some kind of setting for his team that enables him to do so, but he says that he honestly does not and since it is my system I believe him.  He might be the best player in the world at this game and he says he is, but you would have to see it to believe it for yourselves.  This intense struggle to win and make every goal at this game and send your opponents into the electrical fence that surrounds all the fields in this game is what makes this game so great and so competitive.

The game takes place in 2014 where the worlds economy has collapsed and war has become a daily thing. You play as Solid Snake a genetically engineered soldier whose basically perfect at what he does. Snakes mission in this game is to eliminate his twin brother liquid snake who is in charge of his own personal military company.

Pros:
The graphics for the time of this release were arguably THE best ever seen in the gaming world. The character models are great the environments look good everything overall just looks good. The gameplay is very fun and challenging, playing stealthy is a blast and very rewarding. the bosses, while maybe not as good as some from its predecessors, are challenging and you feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat them. What's a nice addition to this game too is the ""octocamo"" which is a suit that has the ability to blend into its environment like an octopus making it harder for the enemy to see you.

Cons:
As I mentioned before the gameplay is fun, the problem is there's not enough of it. At times the game basically just feels like one big cut scene with the gameplay just serving as a pathway from one to the next. The cut scenes can range from 20 minutes to an hour or more. This wouldn't be a problem if they had more gameplay to back it up. The story while good can be very confusing at times and newcomers will have trouble with a lot of the references from previous titles. I highly recommend you play the other games first before playing this one. If you want this game just for an awesome stealth experience it will suffice, but you will feel underwhelmed by the small chunks of gameplay in between each cut scene. The bosses as I mentioned are fun but a lot of the fun too comes from battling the regular enemies whether you're dispatching them by lethal or non-lethal means stealthily or simply just sneaking past them. either way there's not enough of these sections and it really hurts the gameplay time.

Despite having flaws an being a little overrated MGS4 is an easy recommendation to anyone a fan of the stealth genre. Even though I said there's a small amount of gameplay compared to the cut scenes the gameplay that's here is just so good that it would too tough to pass up and also if you're a fan of games with a good story this one is an apex in those terms assuming you've played previous entries in the series.",0.03648735222262011
4248,5.0,"There were two games that made me love the Nintendo 64: Goldeneye 007 and Mario Kart 64. They were the defining games of the console, and Nintendo might have done something as significant with Mario Kart Wii.

The basics are the same: you pick your character and kart before heading out to one of the widely varying tracks. You race against 12 foes (computer- or user-controlled) with the single aim of crossing the finish line first. All the while, you pick up items that can either aid you directly or just mess with those around you. There are additional modes of play (battles, time trials, etc.), but the core is the Grand Prix sets of races. You do four in a row and your scores are aggregated to give you a standing for that grand prix. The more of them you do and the better you place, the more stuff you unlock.

That's one of the great things about Mario Kart: it's as complicated as you want it to be. Want to just grab the controller and go or play with a newbie? Put the bots on easy and go for it. Want to get in farther? Put the bots on medium and see if you can get at least a star in every grand prix. Want to get obsessive? Put the bots on hard, get three stars in every set of races, and unlock every character and kart. Your choice.

The items haven't changed a lot: bananas are still slippery, green shells go straight, red shells seek the first person ahead of you, etc. The most interesting addition is what has been called the ""socialist shell,"" a blue shell that immediately and inescapably flies to the person who is in first place and knocks them for a loop (as well as taking away any items they might have) no matter what protection they have. Even if you haven't uttered a curse word in your life, there's a decent chance the blue shell will eek a few out of you.

The range of characters is much improved and the three different classifications of special karts that match the character's size (small, medium, large) go a long way toward getting you a kart that works with your specific racing style.

There are three basic methods of control:
1) Nunchuck and Wiimote
2) Wiimote as a steering wheel
3) Classic controller

The nunchuck and Wiimote is probably the most popular one in my experience. You use the nunchuck in one hand to steer and hold the Wiimote in the other to use items, pop wheelies, and do tricks in the air.

The Wiimote as a steering wheel is my least favorite. I'm sure if you spend some time getting used to it, it can be very enjoyable, but I'm so used to the N64 that I prefer a joystick. Most people tend to oversteer with this.

The last control scheme is my favorite: the Classic controller. This attempts to act as a surrogate for older Nintendo controllers while playing Virtual Console games, but some new games allow you to use it in them as well. This allows you to use an analog joystick while preserving the old feel of the N64 controller. If you go this route, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wii-Classic-Controller-Grip/dp/B000PHX4KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wii Classic Controller Grip</a>&nbsp;is a must.

Single-player replayability isn't that great, but I've literally played each map about twenty times by now, and as long as anyone else is willing to play, I'm more than happy to pick up the controller.

Pros
- Internet and four-player local multiplayer
- More characters, karts, and items
- Great new and classic tracks
- Same fantastic gameplay

Cons
- Using Wiimote as steering wheel can be frustrating

Tip: while the solder is still wet, use a pen to press firmly down on the back of the socket to ensure the contacts are solid.  Skill level: My 11 year old did it himself after I showed him how.

From the detailed city streets that comprise your virtual playground to the weapons, cars, and characters who'll shape the actions you make,  this game provides seemingly limitless opportunity to let our imaginations run wild and fulfill those dirty, unfulfilled desires that resound in the shadow of our being.
How you play this game is totally up to you.  You can fulfill the quest of Tommy Vercetti and proceed to destroy your enemies and own the whole of Vice City.  Or, you can spend hours wreaking havoc on the innocent masses with cars, motorcycles, guns, chainsaws, knives, swords, even golfclubs.  Or you can span the town putting out fires in a stolen fire engine, rescue lives via the hospital's ambulance, or take the law into your own hands in a vigilante killing spree.  You can even be a pizza delivery boy.  The structure of this game relies solely on what you want to do.  Do you need a plot?  The game leaves that question up to the player, a thing almost blasphemous to most titles.
Overall, I would argue that this title is nothing short of revolutionary.  It will change the way we think about video games and is one title that truly entertains the medium of our imagination.",-0.04615349927849927
4277,5.0,"Okay, I admit it. I am apt to buy anything with the words ""Sid Meier's"" above the title. Sid has always been the reason I enjoy owning a computer. His games are big, detail-oriented games that never run out of playability. I also like games about pirates. I bought both recent pirates games (this one and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"").

I got Sid Meier's Pirates yesterday, and it does not disappoint. It seemingly does not matter how much I look forward to owning a Sid game, I always get more than expected. I had read some reviews here, and thought it would be a struggle to keep the game running. I heard rumors of terrible bugs and unexplained behavior. I have another recent game from the same company. That other game is NOT running, these many months after I bought it. Pirates is running and running very well. I have not experienced any problems with it.

This game makes you a pirate, complete with a starter ship and a background story. You get to sail around to different ports, buying and selling merchandise. The manual tells me that you can choose to be peaceful and just buy low and sell high without any combat at all. I'll have to take their word for it. I did what I wanted to do, attacking ships with my cannons and captains with my sword. The game is beautiful eye candy with lots to do. It reminds me of a rich open-ended RPG. I didn't feel like I had to perform certain tasks in order to complete rigid scenarios. I was just out having funny, trying to build a name and wealth for myself. There are sea battles, land battles and impressive swordfights aboard ships. There are all sorts of characters with whom to interact, governors, pirates, barmaids, crew members, beautiful ladies, bartenders, merchants and even monks. There was everything I expected except rum. Oh well, my local AA group should be happy.

I was surprised that steering the ship and fighting the fights is done using the numeric keyboard. My Gamepad controller seemed like a better option. Everything is straightforward. There is almost no learning curve. It is easy to steer ships, fight, meet people and find trouble. Still, I'm hoping I will get to use a real game controller someday with this game.

I am 42 years old, yet I have been playing this game almost every second since I got it, as if I were a kid. Like other Sid Meier games, it's at least as addictive as rum. Some strange things I noticed were that nobody ever dies in the game, despite all the battles. If you lose swordfights, you end up in prison rather than the morgue. There is no blood and no death, which they probably did in order to get the E rating, that means its suitable for everyone.

One aspect of the game I don't truly understand has to do with fancy dance parties. Sometimes in order to get items or information you want, you end up trying to impress a governor's daughter on the dance floor. These sometimes beautiful and always shallow ladies are only impressed by your feet. You have to follow them step for step in proper time with the music. After quite a few dances, I got tired of this aspect. As a pirate, I'd rather kidnap the girl and force her to give me the items and info I want, or hold her hostage and threaten to send her pieces back to her daddy if he doesn't come through with items, info and big bucks. Dancing systems like a very un-pirate-like way to get what I want. Arggggg!

My problem is that I buy Sid Meier games, but I like to create my own games using scenario editors. I spent most of yesterday writing campaigns for Empire Earth before Pirates arrived. Would it have killed them to put a scenario editor into Pirates? I think not, especially since all kinds of neat modifications for the game are already available online.

I am enjoying this game very much. I just can't say enough good things about it. The game looks superb and plays very well. I even loved the manual, which was so entertaining that I read all of it, despite the fact that the game is so easy to play that I didn't need to read anything at all. It is just that well-written. Having said all that, if the expansion pack team is out there reading this review, please let use our gamepads, and please add multiplayer capabilities as well as a scenario editor.

Sid Meier's Pirates is truly a winner. Spectacular in every way. You will enjoy it. You will have fun with it, both now and for years to come. Anyone who doesn't find something to love here probably likes spreadsheets better than PC games.",0.041884966959404225

I've never used Corsair products that didn't play a vital role in the performance of my PC, but because they have a solid reputation, I thought I'd try these out.

Set up is simple. Download the drivers and plug the headset in. As others have mentioned, the only downside to the drivers is that you can't access them while piping through music during your game. This may seem minor to some, but it can be time consuming and it's difficult to find that ""sweet spot"" when you aren't actively listening for it. It can be found, and when you find it, it is sweet, so I can't really dock stars for that.

The construction is surprisingly solid and well designed for a headset at this price point. While I still prefer my XP SEVEN's design and build, this is a far cheaper headset with a design and quality that isn't far off. These are solid and comfortable.

Although the battle system is still not perfect, there are now incentives to battles to gain more paint capacity and enemy cards to summon enemies to aid you in non-boss battles.  And each level feels like its very own chapter, and I like it.  One major flaw I had with the game was the fact that there are far too many instances where Mario can get OHKO'd without even knowing it, especially in the overworld.  It's nothing deal-breaking for me, but it does belittle me somewhat.

4318,5.0,"This is quite simply the best game I've ever played. I really enjoyed it, and have played it through four times already. I'll break down my review into multiple categories.

STORY- EXCELLENT. The best story I've ever seen in a game. Its a deep immersive story that draws me in right from the start each time. Its full of plot twists and other unexpected developments. It is believable and well thought out. The story has an excellent ending, something alot of games lack, and its conclusion also lends itself well to the already announced trilogy.

CHARACTERS- EXCELLENT. An rpg isn't very good if it doesnt have well developed NPC's. This one does. Each character has a deep back story, their own personality, and you really get to care for them. I like rpg's where your party characters have their own personality, morality, and agenda, where they will argue with you or each other, where they will join you or leave you based on your actions, and help you finish quests or try to stop you, and maybe even die. This game has all of that.  Some might complain that the number of party characters is somewhat limited in this game, however given the quality of the party characters and the fact that this is part of trilogy and will grow, I think the number was perfect.

CHOICES- EXCELLENT. This is where Mass Effect really shines. Every good rpg game give you lots of choices. You have multiple choices for the main missions, but also for many of the side quests which unlike in alot of games, can be just as fun and immersive as the main quest. Your character actually speaks in this game, and you have multiple responses and ways of handling things. The best part is that Shepard doesn't simply repeat the line you choose, but says or does something along the jist of it. So you never really quite know what he or she's gonna do. This is unlike any other game on the market and really adds to the fun. Also the choices aren't always clear cut good or evil, in fact sometimes, its hard to figure out what the which choice is good or evil. Like real life there are difficult decisions to be made and they are complicated by many shades of gray. The varied choices also allow for some great replays of the game.

ANIMATION- EXCELLENT. Some of the best graphics I've ever seen in a game. facial expressions and body language are detailed and precise. The characters and scenes look so real you forget you are watching animation.

MUSIC/SOUND EFFECTS- EXCELLENT. The music is original and well done. It has its own theme, and is perfect for the game. It is well edited into the game. Likewise the sound effects are top notch.

VOICE ACTING- EXCELLENT. This is another area where Mass Effect really shines. The acting is superb. Every character, not just main ones, but even side quests characters get first rate voice acting. In fact, the main character, Shepard, gets voice acted twice, depending whether you play as male or female, another first for a game.

LEVELING UP- EXCELLENT. Every good rpg allows your characters to grow and become more powerful as the game progresses. There are plenty of leveling and powering up choices to choose from, as well as numerous weapon and armor choices.

ACTION/GAMEPLAY- EXCELLENT. This is another area where this game improves over my previous favorite rpg KOTOR. You actually do fight alot in this game, both on foot and in a vehicle. its not the automatic fighting you seem in some rpgs. While first person shooter fans mught not be impressed, I thought the fighting and cover options were well done. The only improvement I can see being made here, is to allow the use and change of abilites and weapons without having to pause. But considering this is an rpg first, it is not an issue to me.

BUILDINGS/SCENARIOS- EXCELLENT. The main storyline's buildings and backdrops are original, detailed and well designed. Absolutely no complaints. The side quests maps and building are unfortunately a bit repetitive. Considering the sheer number or side quests, and the fact that they are all optional, I cannot fault them for reusing similar backdrops and structures. However this is probably one area that could use some improvement in future games. Another con includes repetitive maps for exploration in the mako.

If you like rpgs with immersive stories, compelling characters, and multitudes of choices you should love this game. Some other Great rpgs include, Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR), (which is my second favorite game) KOTOR II, Jade Empire, Neverwinter Nights II, Mask of the Betrayer, and Baulder's Gate II",0.16229860654042544

Sometimes you just have to get back to the basics - and that is exactly what happens with this newest Mario installment. Nintendo has taken the best features of the first three Super Marios (with some new features too!) and blended them into one great game.

Pros-

- All new version of an great favorite

- Interesting twists

- nice graphics for a hand held game

- Decent game length

- very fun mini games

Cons-

 - Game isn't too challenging for your average gamer

-  Most of the mini games are repeats

Galactic Attack, also known as Rayforce, Gunlock, or Layer Section depending on which region you're in, is a vertically scrolling shmup.  In addition to normal shot, you can lock on to enemies in the background using an on-screen cross hair.  Using the lock shot is also tied into the scoring system, as waiting to lock on to multiple targets increases a multiplier.

Each level leads directly into the next, from outer space to breaking planetary atmosphere to descending into the depths of the underworld.  This makes the game feel like a journey, instead of the random level structure found in many shmups.  Levels also incorporate the lock shot well, allowing you to damage and collapse structures in spectacular displays of firepower.  From a design standpoint, Galactic Attack was really well thought out.

4361,5.0,"DMC3 improves upon just about everything it's two predecessors laid out, including it's legendary original. The crazy thing though about DMC3 is that it is a prequil, which may baffle some of those expecting it to be just as good as it's original.

The variety of things that Dante can do should be the first selling point of this game. With easily at least 50+ moves at his disposal, many gamers will just be awestruck by the variety of things Dante can do in this run of DMC. The slight downside though is that you cannot perform them all at once, as Dante has to chose from 1 of 6 different styles that change the layout of his controls. This creates an interesting strategy for each player though as the game progresses, so it guarantees much replay value for those who want to try the game out in different ways each time.

Another selling point for DMC3 is the increased arsenal at Dante's disposal. Dante has now more weapons than ever to play with, and all of them are much different from the traditional 'sword and guns' approach in DMC2. While I will not divuldge into details, these weapons heavily add onto the amount of variety and content in the game, and give the gamer a sheer feel of 'coolness' eminating from the arrogant red coated devil hunter.

The music in DMC3 is stellar as usual. It is more heavy metal than the last two DMC's, but that is alright. The added in 'evil voice' that sings on all of the songs gives the game an added macho feel that is a definente need since DMC2 was rather quiet and generic despite it being a DMC game.

Graphics are stellar as well, although there probably could have been some pre-rendered cut scenes.

Overall DMC3 improves upon just about everything the first game had. It brings the strength back to the series that it lost with DMC2, and definently leaves the gamer wanting another DMC very soon.",0.036373893670355734

4371,5.0,"My friends got this for me this christmas off amazon.

The only problem I had with this game was ONE BUG, and that was on a quest where I had to etch writing off of statues. I got all of the statues, but it said i was missing one. (it's a bug, I checked online) so of course, I patched it. Still didn't fix it. ONLY problem. I got over it, still a great game, and definitely worth the money my friend paid for it, which was $20. Way better alternative than say, buying origins, and all of the expansions one by one.

A lot of the new characters don't really cut it in replacing the first. The 'keeper' is a total butch. Sigrun's awe and amazement at exploring the 'surface' I can relate to, as I explore all of the new territories and places in Awakening. Ohgren's companion conversations are hilarious. Anders' new nickname for me is 'fruitcake'. The possible background story between anders and the main character, which if you do it right, carries over into dragon age 2, is very enlightening. It gives you an ""I was there and I know what happened, and I experienced this, I was there, man!"" not ""I know what happened because I went ahead and played dragon age 2 "" / ""I looked this up online because I'm a lazy tool"".
I'm an enthusiastic game player and I love playing games like this and trying to find out all of the possible outcomes (No what if's), that take you very in depth with the characters and their background stories. The story from Dragon age 1 and Dragon age 2, tie together very well, despite the criticism.

Awakening / Warden's keep: great story. I toyed around with this a bit. They could have fixed the bugs on it where it gives you an automatic achievement just from starting awakening with a brand new character.. (Ive already beaten dragon age 1 for the pc, so it was no biggie for me to skip ahead) I broke the game and got free achievements doing this, but it was still fun to play through all the stories for the characters and learn everything again. =)

Leliana's song: It tells you leliana's story. It's not supposed to impress anybody I think, and anyone who thinks it sucks, shouldn't have bought it. lot of complaints for this, but pay them no mind. I finally learned how 'it went down' between Leliana and whatsherface.
Darkspawn Chronicles: ""What if"" you failed in origins. I enjoyed playing as a darkspawn vanguard. Dev's did good on the models and controls. Need to re-do the difficulty though on this, ""Normal"" is the new ""NIGHTMARE"".
Witch hunt: I enjoyed getting to tie things off with morrigan. I left off in Origins, with me raising my fist at the screen, exclaiming ""Run, rabbit, run!"". good back-story.

Golems of Amgarrak:
Lots of puzzles. Player actually has to use their brains in this expansion, not just hack and slash your way through the entire level and get a bunch of 'easy' achievements. Bioware outdid themselves on this one.
good back-story.

I haven't played the DLC yet for origins, will get on it and update this review. But I'm not bored with it yet after playing awakening, so I might just play both games, consecutively, all over again.

a few notes to people:

Some of the DLC is different in terms of difficulty. I had more trouble on Darkspawn chronicles on NORMAL than I did playing Golems of Amgarrak and AWAKENING (the entire thing) on nightmare. Difficulty needs to be redone for this game in a patch.

Some bugs for quests are not apparent until it's already too late. Patch your game FIRST; XBox live silver will do the trick.

4408,5.0,"I had no idea what to expect with this title at all. I've owned Blizzard games before, and like almost all of them a great deal, but this is very different from, say, Starcraft. I picked this up because my brother told me that I would like it, and I tend to trust his opinion so I got it.

Pros-

Gameplay -

The gameplay is *very* smooth on the PS4 version. I was blown away by how much was going on, how many things I was doing and that nothing happened with flickering or slowness or anything at all. I've been an avid gamer my whole life and this was noticeably impressive.

Amount of stuff to do -

Replayability is a HUGE problem with games today. I bought The Last of Us, which is still easily the best game I've ever played, ever... but I beat it in 2 days and then that was kind of it. I had no idea how much there was to do in this game when I started. Beating the campaign with 1 of the 6 classes took me 4 marathon play sessions (unintentional, I would look up and see it was 1am and I'd have to be at work at 8), and then there's almost an infinite amount of stuff to do even after that with Adventure mode, the different difficulties, multiplayer etc. Very impressive and very worth the money.

Refined simplicity -

I'll admit the game is fairly simple. You control a character, do quests and kill monsters. The camera doesn't move, you level up and gain abilities and treasure... Simple right? It's a perfect level of simple for my tastes. Resogun is another great game and that has the same characteristics in a way. It's a side scrolling arcade shooter that's like something you'd see on Atari, yet it's just so much fun to play. I think this is really something missing in a lot of today's games that is always well-received when it works as well as it does in Diablo.

Cons-

Sometimes repetitive - I think the Barbarian mainly gets to be a little repetitive. You'll find that with certain areas or parts of the game as well. I'll admit that some things are as a whole, but it never seems like it. They sprinkle enough random monsters or dungeons in there where you don't even notice you're doing the same mission for the 5th time and I love that. (Did that just turn into a pro...?)

There was no instructional booklet in the game case. I know, I know, no one ever reads those... but for this - I didn't know what a lot of the icons meant and I didn't figure out what half of the bonuses looked like until just recently (maybe after 20-25 hours). I don't know if I'm slow or what, but they weren't obvious and I had to go look up some of them online.

Normal is far too easy. Far, far too easy. And that's it for the cons!

The negative reviews seem to be centered around the fact that they made an uninformed purchase and blame the product instead of giving themselves a 1-star review for effort. This game is about grinding through levels, exploring, trying to get new items, upgrading current items, missions etc. If you're expecting to jump into a 'your brain is mashed potatoes' Michael Bay extravaganza swear-fest like Call of Duty, this isn't for you. If you like to sit down, enjoy a story, listen to dialogue, build a character over a long period of time and are fond of games like Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls, Baldur's Gate - you'd probably like this a lot.",0.05951011053560348

It may seem like a small thing but it made the game easier.  Still the Mega Man series isn't easy.  But that's part of the charm.  It is a little tough, but can be beaten with perseverance.

It is a great thing to have if you want to store files you want protected, use it as a sort of safe, if something on your hard drive corrupts or if your hard drive corrupts all you hard earned work will still be saved.  512 MB might not sound like a lot but think about it a  Gears of War 3 game take less then 2MB to save.  That is about 256 saved games right there.  Also the memory car can be used as an emergency hard drive if you current hard drive is broken or you lent it to some one.

4437,5.0,"I should probably state that the last time I played a racing game was on my PC using the arrow keys to control a make shift car about 15 years ago.  I am no gamer that is for sure, however this could be about to change with the wii and Mario Kart.  The wii has converted me into buying a console and Mario Kart has given me a love for racing games.

To begin with I found the operation using the wheel very easy to master.  I am not that good when it comes to joysticks and other things so being able to turn the wheel like I would in a car is a major plus for me.  There are good number of cars and motorbikes to choose from and courses.  I am sure there are many more to unlock if I am ever able to be able to win.  But even with my zero skill and never really being able to keep much above 8th place I have found the game interesting and fun.

I love the extras that allow you to throw traps at your opponents and give you extra boosts of speed that allow you to shoot forward.  I would recommend buying an extra wii wheel if you intend to have multi-players.  I think the wheel allows people of all ages to player together and have lots of fun.  Kids can feel as though they have been allowed to drive before they can.

4440,5.0,"The NDS Lite is far more the best portable system ever! I recieved the Polar White DS Lite for my 14th B-day 4 days ago! 4 DAY AGO meaning I hadn't even had it long to realize it's greatness! There are tons of great games for the DS. There's Mario 64 DS, Mario Kart, Resident Evil, Metroid Prime Hunters, Hotel Dusk, Touch of the dead, New Super Mario Bros. (An old classic Remaked into better graphics!), Mario Hoops 3 on 3, Animal Crossing: Wild World, Ultimate Mortal Kombat (Coming out soon!), Dementium: The Ward (Coming out Soon), the new Zelda game thats coming out soon, Mario Party DS (Coming out soon), The Sims 2, Sims 2 Pets, Nintendogs, Purr Pals, Phoenix Wright: Justice for all, Final Fantasy, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, My Sims (Coming Soon), Sims Castaway (Coming Soon), Yoshi's Island DS, Super Princess Peach, Tony Hawk American Sk8t Land DS, Tony Hawk Down Hill Jam DS, and many more. You can also play all of your GBA games on it too! But not original Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. Which is pretty much the only thing wrong with the NDS Lite. If you are looking for DS games with 3D graphics, you might want to look at: Resident Evil DS, Youch of the Dead DS, New Super Mario Bros. DS (But still on a 2D platform), Super Mario 64 DS, Final Fantasy DS, Sims 2 DS, Sims 2 Pets 2 DS, Mario Party DS (Coming Soon), Ultimate Mortal Kombat DS (Coming Soon), Dementium: The Ward (Coming Doon), The new Zelda game thats coming out, Mario Kart DS, Mario Hoops 3 on 3 DS, Animal Crossing: Wild World DS, American Sk8t Land, Tony Hawk Down Hill Jam, Hotel Dusk, Phoenix Wright: Justice for all, all the sports games for the DS, and many more DS games with great graphics.

  Now about the actual console. DS stands for Dual Screen for those who wanted to know. The DS is way brighter that the original DS. In fact the lowest brightness level on the DS Lite is a little bit brighter than the highest brightness level on the regular DS. Therefore with the DS Lite you can go into dark areas and play, you can even play in the bed at night when you can't sleep! Another thing is the DS Lite is smaller and sexier than the regular DS. The DS Lite has cool glossy transparent plastic on top of white, black, or pink plastic towards where it looks like and probably was desinged with the help of the iPod company ""Apple"". The only bad thing about this is that all three colors attract finger prints. They are easy to clean of if you use a cloth made with 100% cotton, the cloth people use to clean eye glasses works perfect! The DS Lite's small size allows you to easily slide it into your pocket without the struggle the old bulky DS would have given you. The DS Lite even has the DS symbol on the front which the regular DS did not have. The on and off button is now a slider on the top edge of the DS Lite so that you won't accidently shut off the DS Lite, which was a small problem with the original DS. The stylus is now easiar to reach. The stylus is also thicker, bigger, and is really hard to break which is a good thing for those with adult hands, though the stylus is bigger than the original, it still slides into the stylus slot on the DS like a glove. The button on the DS Lite are softer than the original's so if you hit the buttons hard and you have long nails (which by the way I have nails so its a relief for me) it won't hurt. The DS Lite and GBA SP's charger hook ups are the exact same size which means the DS Lite use the GBA SP car charger and the orignal can't because the orignal has a bigger charger hook up than the DS Lite, and the DS Lite has better battery life. So if you have the regular DS I would totally reccomend that you upgrade to the DS Lite.

  Alright, now that I'm done comparing lets talk about the sytem alone. What you will find in the box when you purchse the DS Lite is : a DS Lite, charger, extra stylus, DS Lite instruction manual, and a few Nintendo advertizing ads.

  The DS Lite's battery life can last 15 to 19 hours on the lowest brightness level and I know because I played it every day for 4 days and only had to charge it once and when I get a new system I play it ALL the time and the DS Lite instruction manual says so, so don't think I'm exagerating about it. The DS Lite has battery info. There are two lights on the right hand corner hinge on the DS Lite that turns red when the battery runs low. A warning even comes up on the middle of the screen in the middle of a game warning you to save because the battery could die any minute.

  You could change the back ground color on the screen on the DS setting if you want. For the parents out there who are conserned about the picto chats and Wi Fin connection can breath because you have to have friend codes to chat online on the DS which means you have to already know the person before you can contact them on the DS which sucks. Plus you have to be within 30 feet of that person which I think is really stupid. Nintendo probably has it this way to protect younger players from sexual predaters. So WiFi capabilities is useless unless your under the same roof as someone with a DS.

  The DS Lite also comes with a GBA cartrige slot that prevents dust from getting into the GBA slot and also keeps the DS Lite looking slick when there isn't a GBA game in it. One bad thing about the DS Lite that was never a problem with the original DS is that when there is a GBA game in it, the game sticks out. It's not really a big deal because it doesn't effect your playing at all. It just looks weird. I admit I never was a big hand held fan because I prefered the games on the T.V. screen because I like good graphics and a big screem. But the DS Lite is a big step is hand held history because not only does it have the graphics of a home console but the game is edited to fit the DS screen towards where the screen size doesn't even matter! Kind of like how at the movie theater the movie looks great on the big screen and when you buy it on DVD it still looks great on your smaller regular T.V.

  The DS Lite's touch screen doesn't scratch up if you just use the stylus that comes with it. At the tip of the DS Lite stylus is soft plastic that doesn't scratch the touch screen. So those who say that the touch screen scratch up easily must be using something other that the stylus that comes with it. For those who wish that the DS could have internet capabilities you can buy the opera browser for DS Lite. The opera Browse allows you to surf the web on your DS and it only cost $30. If you want to play music and videos on you DS buy an R4 card. I have a video Ipod so I'm not really concentrating on that. There's one more special feature the DS Lite has that little know about. You can even use the DS Lite as a controller for the WII! Well thats all! Oh! And for those who says the DS games are kiddie, there are alot of T rated games and a few M rated games available for DS. GTA is even out for GBA! There are even alot of M and T rated games coming out during the holiday, plus all the games are rated E for EVERYONE! Meaning all ages! Plus all the Mario games are ment for all ages. So pretty much the DS Lite was the best hand held I have ever gotten! Which is a big step because my first had held was a Game Boy pocket, my 2and was a GBA, then it's the fabulous DS Lite!

4442,5.0,"Well I think that many reviews given already talk about the learning curve, so I won't get into that much, but I thought that as someone who played/taught tennis for a living I might be able to add to all these reviews.

First, I got my game just yesterday. I decided to go with the Motion and Nunchuck right from the start since I like the idea of having as much control over my player as possible. As stated by others it does take some time to get the movement and timing down(can't say I'm a great at it yet but good enough to win matches).

Things you can and can't do.

Can - hit with topspin/slice/or flat on groundstokes - haven't always felt like I have the time to react and still do that consistently, but when I have time and try it the game executes it nicely.

Can - hit crosscourt down the line or inside-out, I haven't mastered the timing on the down the lines yet but when I do I feel like I will be a force.

Can - aim serve and I assume have some control over the power

Can - volley and drop volley like the best pro's ever (I drop volley alot in this game) and some of the angle volleys are very good

Can - lob and drop shot (haven't lobbed much so I can't tell if it will have much effect for my matches (not like you can throw up a huge defensive lob to get you back in the point or roll a topspin lob of a tight net player)

Can't - move in a little when returning serves to chip and charge, have to stay the same distance until after you hit the ball

Can't - always move immediately after hitting a shot so recoverey isn't always very easy. (maybe it will be better on Hard?)

Can't - as far as I know- hit slice, topspin or flat serves on demand. With the motion control I would have liked to been able to. If I am wrong about this please let me know.

Those are a few of my thoughts on controls adn shot making.

The game seems to only allow you to play tournaments with your created player(if that is true that is too bad). There are some side games at each tournament that add to the overall gaming experience but at least on EASY the matches in the tournaments are only to 3 games (win by two) I would have liked to be able to adjust this like you can when you play just singles (3 out of 5 full sets is nice)

Many have said how hard it is to win at first. The trick is getting to the net (at least on easy) I serve and volley most of the time and the angles and drop shots are working well. (not as easy to break, just like real tennis)

In all I really liked this game (Wii sport tennis doesn't even compare) I like all the Pro's and Legends and the 4 Grand Slam venues. (Not sure how the different surfaces play since there should be a noticable difference in court speed). Having the ability to hit most of the shots you want and move where you want is exactly what I was looking for. It will be interesting to see how my 9/11 yrs old play though without the tennis strategies that I use. With the motion and nunchuck I would say this is a challenging game for a novice but as a former player I like that.

This is definitely at the top of my list for PS2 games, due to addicting gameplay, fantastic presentation, some of the coolest looking blood ever in a game, and a combat system that is relatively second-to-none.

4445,5.0,"The SteelSeries Siberia's are, hands down, the best gaming headphones I've used. High's include excellent wireless interface, battery life, dynamic range, and comfort. My most significant quibble is that they are not the loudest headset, sometimes requiring bumping up the in-game audio signal to its max.

I'm comparing these against an Afterglow LVL 5 (not recommended), Sennheiser X320 wired Xbox-specific headphones, and Sennheiser PXC450 noise cancelling travel headphones. I have them hooked into my receiver so that they're useful both for gaming and for general use with the TV. The flexible connectors on the hub unit really help in this regard. I think you would be hard pressed to find an AV setup that these are not compatible with right out of the box.

The wireless Xbox interface is the highlight that sets these above my expensive travel headphones and even ultra-pricey studio monitors that I've tried. The ability to hide away the mic or to quickly hook it up via chat cable, balance the chat/game sound, and dive into coop games is great. The mic picks up your voice very clearly while eliminating most background interference. One of my regular gaming buddies actually commented to ask if I'd gotten a new mic because he could tell the difference. The wireless connectivity is a great upgrade. I no longer have a 15 foot cable stretching across my living room and turning into a rats nest tangle every time I've put it away.

The sound itself is significantly better than the older Sennheiser Xbox headphones and puts the cheap Chinese knockoffs to deep shame. Bass reproduction is good, highs and mids are phenomenal.

4447,5.0,"Some people are complaining about the fact that there's a small amount of drama in this. One of the main players has a wife and kid that he's having trouble keeping. Because he's always gone on missions, he hardly sees them, and he has to make a decision between them and defending freedom. I see this as a really good and important aspect to the game and one not found in other war games. It actually shows some human emotion to the ugliness of killing and war. Sure, we all love to run and gun, and you do that most of the time here, but for maybe less then 100 mb. of hd space, you see a man in a realworld situation dealing with real life issues. It adds alot to the story imo. If you want pure kill games, there's plenty out there. It's nice to see a little human touch in a game. Especially one as violent as this is.

The graphics here are great, if you have the right gear. The sound and music is perfect with the explosions just right. Some games amp up the sounds of gunfire and bombs and it gets to be too much for me. A bullet should not sound like a rocket going by. The pacing is good, although we could have used a few less doors to kick in. That part was getting a little old. The door banging should not be used so much, but more like the real world. Many in the East use simple curtains for doors or bamboo. They could have come up with different ways to enter rooms. When you repeat any action, it gets old, especially in a high action game.

This game is not as long, in single player, as it should be. Is it worth the money? Yes, but only if you plan on playing with other people as well as by yourself.

Be sure your card is updated as this one demands good graphics and does run on the warm side. I had to open the case for more air, when it got over 52c. And I have liquid cooling.

4449,5.0,"Even though I'm a hardcore console gamer, I still prefer to go old-school and play some of the older games and roms on my laptop and playing on the keyboard just doesn't quite cut it.

The Logitech F310 was very easy to install as Windows 7 either had or automatically downloaded the driver as I was able to utilize the game pad within seconds of plugging it into my USB slot.  Even if this is not the case with every install, the game pad still comes with an install disc with compatible drivers.

I was able to configure my control interface with my SNES and NES emulator programs fairly quickly and, with a bit of tweaking via the options menu, was able to maximize my experience without any setbacks.  On top of the, the controller felt relatively comfortable in my hands, that is to say my gargantuan-sized hands weren't cramping given how small many game pads can be.

All in all, the Logitech F310 is a good controller with not real complex issues.",0.011948617830970775

4454,5.0,"I've been using Razer products since they became a thing ages ago. I needed a new mouse because my last one kicked the bucket, so I decided to stick with the Naga because of the muscle memory I've developed with it over a decade of MMOs, rather than switching to one of the other brands with a button grid.

The Naga Chroma seems like a solid build and I'm very happy with it so far (I previously had the older version). It does what I need at a moderate price. However, Razer products have historically had short lifespans. I've been through at least six of the Naga series mice since I began buying them. Usually their scroll wheel begins skipping or sticking after awhile. I've had some develop double-clicking on the mouse buttons. I had one completely brick from a firmware update. Only time will tell if this one will hold up well. In my experience they usually last through about a year of heavy usage (8+ hours a day), which I feel is pretty good.

If you want a nice, relatively cheap gaming mouse with a ton of customizable buttons, this is the way to go. If you want a gaming mouse that will last years and years, use caution and don't expect much. Razer may have upped their game since my last purchase, but I'll believe it when I see it.

4464,5.0,"Most of the time when you think of a first-person shooter, you picture fast-paced slaughter and mayhem like in the legendary Quake and Unreal line.  Deus Ex, however, adds an unprecedented level of intelligence to a genre previously devoid of any thought other than ""if it moves, kill it"".
Deus Ex follows Agent JC Denton on his first assignment for UNATCO - an anti-terrorist group with wide-reaching jurisdiction.  JC is a special nanotech-augmented cyborg with a wide range of superhuman abilities.  You are able to customize your character throughout the game in an RPG-esque style.  Want to go in with guns blazing?  Increase training in heavy arms and pistols.  Want to take out the bad guys from a distance?  Focus on Rifle training.  Want to hack into the security system and have it eliminate the bad guys for you?  Train heavily on electronics and computers.  Want to be able to heal yourself instantly?  Train up on Medicine.  Depending on how you train your character, the gameplay changes significantly.  This not only adds tremendous amounts of depth, but also increases the replay value.  As if that wasn't enough, the storyline is very intricate and boasts some superb twists.  You will end up not knowing who to trust as the game goes on.  The plotline culminates in three possible endings, depending on whose side you choose.

4465,5.0,"I am an at home exerciser and looking for something to spice up my workouts, so when I saw the Wii Fit I couldn't wait to try it out and I do love it. The game itself is pure genius. The way the Wii can access your weight and BMI, greet you according to time of day, give you tips etc. And of course the way you can interact with the game. You make a little Mii (one that resembles you or someone you would like to look like for example) and you exercise along with it. At the same time your family members can make  Mii's and will show up to cheer for you as you work out!

The Wii fit game software includes Aerobics, Yoga, Strength Training, Balance and Favorites. You begin with a body test that accesses BMI and balance and then choose the exercises you want to do. A Wii Fit board sends signals to your Wii to give you feedback as to how you are performing each exercise.

The whole concept and the way it works is pure Genius. It's fun, easy to understand and motivating as you try to best your prior score on activities. For the price of a round of golf at a good golf course or a couple nights at the movies you have a lot of easy to access fitness fun without leaving your home.

I do say the product is dumbed down though because it definitely has limitations. After each exercise you have to wait for a score to pop up or wait through a screen shot of a sad or happy looking Mii (depending on how well you did the exercise) so there is a lack of continuity. The Wii Fit also does not prescribe a fitness plan so if you wanted you could bounce soccer balls off your head (one of the balance exercises) for 30 minutes and say  you did your workout. Another drawback are the personal trainers. The game ""Yourself Fitness"" which was released a few years ago has an animated trainer who is much more intricate and real than the Wii trainers so the technology is there, not sure why Wii didn't use it.  And there are other little things,  Wii included a step exercise so why not give a choice of music? Wii has an island lap, why not give a few additional scenic laps. It is also pretty easy to unlock new exercises, making it harder would keep people motivated longer.

Overall though, I have exercised for the past 7 days and not missed so that says something. Will Fit is a great start and I hope the company comes out with many more games for it in the future.

4466,5.0,"...but still a great game in its own right.

I wasn't really sure what to make of this game at first. From the screen caps and the description it certainly sounded like Far Cry. Large, non-linear maps; Realistic weapons; Lots of vehicles; Stealth and sniping; Lush, vivid environments. So what if there was no mention of mutant gorillas or mad scientists tinkering with genes? It's not like they can give away the entire plot on the back of the box, right?

Well, there are no mutants, no Faustian knock-offs. Aside from the hang-gliders strewn across the map there is little here that indicates a direct inspiration from Far Cry. The storyline and characters from the original do not appear anywhere in this sequel, nor is there any tropical island scenery. Other than the machete (now your default - and unswappable - weapon) none of the guns from the original's arsenal are available. If you were looking for a nostalgic return to the islands, and possibly more cut scenes of Val in her unmentionables, then Far Cry 2 is sure to disappoint.

However, if your tastes go beyond a mere sequel, or if you have not even played the original Far Cry then you might be pleasantly surprised by this title. This is one exceptionally detailed and finely crafted game. That's not to say that it doesn't have its quirks, but overall Far Cry 2 is an astounding achievement.

Some Highlights and Irritations:

 - Incredibly detailed environment: Seriously, the pseudo-african ""nation"" where this game takes place has been intricately and lovingly crafted. Even at the medium settings the scenery is practically photo realistic and at the ultra-high settings it becomes a framerate killing showpiece for the graphics engine. Only a dedicated gaming PC will be able to handle the top-tier settings and still remain playable, but like I said, even on medium the game's environment is gorgeous. Grass, trees, and plants sway in the breeze; zebras wander the grasslands and gazelles will sprint across the dusty roads as they hear your jeep approach. There's a day and night cycle, weather... I could list the details all day, but the point is that the scenery really lets you immerse yourself in this fictional world.

- Realistic Weapons: Far Cry 2 features real-world weapons (or exact approximations thereof) from old stand-bys like the AK-47 to the more exotic grenade and rocket launchers. You won't find any completely out of place gluon-guns or experimental laser pistols here - the core concept is realism, so your choices reflect the types of weapons (one assumes) you could actually find in a black market shop in war torn country. Each weapon is incredibly detailed, both visually and in terms of game play mechanics: each weapon has a realistic fire rate, recoil and damage associated with it. Weapon reliability also plays an important role, as guns will jam with increasing frequency over time and will eventually break altogether. Weapons picked up from fallen foes are visibly rusty and worn and extremely unreliable . This adds an interesting aspect to the game play as you have to weigh your weapon selections wisely. For longer missions you may opt for the less accurate but more reliable weapon, and out in the field you might switch to your pistol rather than risk grabbing that crummy assault rifle your enemy just dropped. There is a good range and variety of weapons - several sniper rifles, pistols, heavy and light machine guns, assault rifles and shotguns. In addition to the standard FPS arsenal you can use IED's, (basically these serve a your remotely detonated explosives), a mortar (yes, a friggin' mortar), two types of rocket and grenade launchers and a crossbow that fires explosive tipped arrows. For the stealth fans there is a scoped dart-rifle, silenced pistol, mk5 and shotgun. Grenades and Molotovs are your standard throwables.

- Destructible everything: Pretty scenery is nice but if the environment is no more than a backdrop it does little to heighten the gamin experience. Fortunately, the environment in Far Cry 2 plays an integral role, offering cover, vantage points and multiple approaches to both the player and the AI, and creating a dynamic playing field where a safe spot can suddenly become a death trap as the battle takes its toll. Some structures are entirely destructible and will come crashing down around you if hit by a grenade. Others have roofs of straw that offer little protection from mortar rounds, or corrugated walls that allow larger caliber rounds to penetrate through. Almost everything that can burn in real life - the grass, trees, wooden posts and planks, can catch fire - fuel barrels, propane tanks, and other explosive containers can be set off by brush fires or errant rounds, quickly spreading flames and chaos. In this ever changing environment you learn to scout your targets and throw your grenades wisely.

- Virtual Sandbox: The game is basically a wide-open playground that allows you to approach objectives at your own pace and with whatever tactics your prefer. If you like to run in shooting with a SAW and tossing grenades left and right then the game gives you plenty of ways to sate your appetite for explosions. If you like the silent approach then you have a decent selection of stealthier weapons to assist you, not to mention, you can choose to prowl elusively under the cover of darkness. How you enter a  fight has consequences beyond the current battle: because this is a continuous map (with no loading screens) your activities will draw attention from enemy positions nearby. If you make a lot of noise you will have to deal with reinforcements - suddenly the sleepy safe house with 2 guards is swarming with Jeeps and is in the scope of a distant sniper. Alternately, if you are discovered sneaking into camp you'll find yourself engaged in a close range fire-fight where your arsenal of stealth weapons is badly outclassed.

Minor irritations:

- No leaning: Unlike Far Cry you can not lean out of cover. I don't know why this useful combat feature is not present here but it bugs me to have to not be able to lean in and out while taking cover behind a wall or doorway.

- No scope ""bounce"": For a game as dedicated to realism as this one, it was disappointing to find that the scoped sights don't move an iota (in real-life it is impossible to keep your hands/arms completely still. This natural movement is amplified when you view an object through binoculars or a scope, making long range targeting much more difficult). This reduces even the longest range shots to a simple matter of pointing and clicking. This is a major oversight for an FPS like this, particularly given that Far Cry had this feature.

- Invisible walls and unscalable objects: Of course there has to be some type of border somewhere, the map can't go on forever. What irks me is when you run into invisible walls in the middle of a map where the game designers simply decided they didn't want you to go. Too often you'll spot a great location to scout or snipe from only to find it is artificially inaccessible. A similarly frustrating quirk is that you sometimes will not be able to jump or climb up to a height (like a rock, or the hood of a car) that is at the players waist level. There are occasions where you get the option to climb up on something, but these appear to have been specifically programmed in. This wouldn't have been such a big deal if the diamond side quest, which has you looking for hidden suitcases containing rough diamonds, didn't frequently take you to rocky ledges and so forth where the next step up seems just above the characters ability to jump up to.

At the end of the day this is a fantastic game for those looking for a well-crafted, non-linear FPS. Highly recommended.",0.01916409762504992

4470,5.0,"As much as I loved and was addicted to Diablo 2, the graphics just weren't there. When you killed a boss and little red pixels splashed everywhere, it made the moment almost laughable. Diablo's programmers took the many comments about the graphics to heart, and they did a STELLAR job of revamping them in this expansion.
I would have easily bought the expansion for the graphic upgrade alone - that makes Diablo 2 almost like an entirely new game, worth playing through all over again. However, they didn't stop there. There are 2 new races - the druid and the assassin - both of which I *love*. The assassin has cool attack moves that are great fun to watch. The druid can either shapeshift, or summon creatures, or control the elements. I love all three, but the elemental attacks are GREAT! This has become my new favorite character.
There are new monsters to fight, an ENTIRE new act with great graphics, tons of new weapons, even new Cube recipes to play with. And, in a move that other game companies should pay attention to, you can now have TWO sets of weapons defined (i.e. bow and sword/shield for example) and easily toggle between them. I've been dying for that in every game I've played!
It is really like an entirely new game, with the added benefit that you don't have to learn new keystrokes. I *highly* encourage any Diablo 2 lover to grab this, and if you don't have either one yet, treat yourself and get them both!",0.02802814060406771

4483,5.0,"After God of War II's attention grabbing and very teasing cliffhanger ending, we finally get to see what happens with Kratos and the titans as they climb Mt. Olympus and begin their battle against the gods. Let me quickly get this slight complaint out of the way and say that the big battle between the titans and gods didn't go about the way I thought it would; it wasn't as large scale or earth shattering as I was hoping it would be. Regardless, it was still an awesome battle and in the longer run it was an awesome game. The game opens right where God of War II left off and you take control of Kratos as he fights undead warriors atop the tree covered shoulders and back of the titan Gaia. Due to this interesting choice of battleground, the landscape moves and sways as Gaia climbs up Mt. Olympus, but not in a dizzying manner, so don't worry about getting motion sickness. The opening boss battle ensues soon afterwards with Poseidon joining the fray and taking out a couple of titans as he surrounds himself with a sort of giant sized suit of water shaped like himself with his pet horseheaded water serpents acting as his many tentacles to attack the titans. As Gaia grapples with Poseidon, Kratos can attack the tentacle serpents and later Poseidon directly with the Blades of Athena and use the Blade of Olympus to create a swirling tornado as his magic attack. Afterwards, Gaia and Kratos reach the top of Mt. Olympus, only to be blasted off by a lightning bolt from Zeus. Gaia is able to save herself, but Kratos is left to ""fall from grace"" once again into the River Styx, which leads to the underworld lair of Hades.

Falling into the river of the dead has the unfortunate but gameplay required effect of depowering Kratos once again by removing his magic, lowering his health, and damaging the Blades of Athena. He also dropped the Blade of Olympus as he fell... this just isn't his day. The ghost of the goddess Athena, whom Kratos accidentally killed at the end of God of War II, appears to inform Kratos of the one thing that can destroy Zeus once and for all, the Flame of Olympus. She then remakes Kratos's damaged blades into the Blades of Exile and Kratos begins his final journey of revenge. Standing in Kratos's way are a bunch of the same kind of mythological beasties that were foolish enough to challenge the Spartan in the previous games, with a lot of them just reimagined or redesigned versions of previous enemies. The only truly different enemies are these big living statues armed with huge clubs. So not a lot in terms of enemy variety in this game. Also, the game appears to throw a smaller number of these creatures at you, which is somewhat disappointing compared to the wide array of enemies the two previous games would send against you at once. The game's story has also lost the storytelling element of its predecessors since Gaia is no longer the narrator but an actual contender in the whole war against the gods, so the cutscenes in the game are more traditional with flashbacks about Kratos's previous exploits and the effects they've had on the world in general. Well, that's it for the very minor negative points of this game, and I'm nitpicking as it is.

The gameplay is as incredibly fun and fast paced as ever, and the new mechanic with the weaponry and magic abilities has been redone, so that's one new thing the game brings to the table. Kratos gets four weapons each with their own magic attacks: the Blades of Exile allow Kratos to summon the souls of dead Spartan soldiers that surround Kratos with their shields and spears in 300 fashion, the Claws of Hades allow him to summon the souls of enemies he has defeated such as cyclopses and centaurs, the Nemean Cestus allow him to slam the ground and send out deadly shockwaves, and the Nemesis Whip lets him electrocute his enemies. The Claws of Hades and the Nemesis Whip are actually very similar to the Blades of Exile, but have slightly different attack styles; the Nemean Cestus however offer a rather different style of combat. They're basically large, steel fighting gauntlets with which Kratos can make short work of most enemies by bashing them into submission. Kratos eventually regains possession of the Blade of Olympus and is given access to the Rage of Sparta. This ability allows Kratos to wield the Blade of Olympus for a short period and smite his enemies with it, with the added benefit of increased attack power, durability, and speed, much like the Rage of the Gods and Rage of the Titans in the first two games. In addition, Kratos acquires other weapon items which run on a separate regenerating meter instead of relying on his magic: the Bow of Apollo which can shoot fiery arrows, the Boots of Hermes that allow Kratos to perform high speed dashes and run up and along certain walls, and the Head of Helios which can be used to illuminate pitch black areas and temporarily blind enemies. Kratos also still has the Golden Fleece and Icarus Wings. Also making a return are an impressive array of challenging boss fights, some of them coming in truly ""titanic"" proportions. Of particular note is a boss fight against a mythological figure who I was hoping would appear in this game, and when he did I was as happy as a child at Christmas; Kratos finally does battle with Hercules... definitely one of the high points of the game.

Once again, quick time events are used to take out Kratos's enemies, open gates, and please the women in sex mini-games; the sexual themes are even stronger in this game... who knew that was possible, right? The QTEs have actually improved in the way they're implemented. When the button prompts appeared in the first two games, they would appear smack dab in the middle of the screen and kind of distract the player from what Kratos was doing to his enemies (or women). In this game, the prompts appear in the corners of the screen that match the placement of the buttons on the controller and don't obstruct the player's view. For example, when required to press the triangle (top) button, the prompt appears at the top portion of the screen, and when required to press the circle (right) button, the prompt appears at the right side of the screen. That was a cool gameplay element. One last addition to the gameplay are these flying portions where Kratos uses the Icarus Wings to dash through these very cramped tubes and he's forced to dodge countless wooden beams, metal barriers, and balls of fire hurtling towards him. Yes, these sections are as hard as they sound, some MUCH more than others. The puzzles so familiar with the series return as well, although they're not quite as challenging as before. The music is as classically awesome as ever with brand new and familiar orchestral scores. Finally, the graphics... WOW. The in-game graphics are so incredible that they're used for all cutscenes. The detail of the environments and characters, the shadowing effects, everything is top notch. Despite the larger number of very minor problems the game has, they are not nearly enough to detract from the overall greatness of the game. This is still God of War and Kratos is still a rather one dimensional character who's about as sympathetic as a serial killer, but he still manages to be as popular as more well rounded main characters simply because of how dedicated and unstoppable he is. And the ending... well, let's just say it keeps you wondering if it truly is the end or the beginning of something else. Get this game. It's as simple as that.",0.004662355321478352

RGB effects like wave, ripple and reactive are awesome! every aspect of lighting down to the individual keys are customizable.",0.06444444444444444
4491,5.0,"despite being a ps2 title, the graphics, sound, and gameplay of this game is impressive. definitely a big budget game that deserves a sequel. the gunplay is satisfying and is constantly fast-paced.
probably the only game i have no gripes with.
good job developers!",0.08634920634920634
4492,5.0,Product as advertised and swift delivery. Would recommend to anyone and do business again.,0.14583333333333331
4493,5.0,Standard controller. Ps button in the middle is a stiff but nothing a little wear n tear can't handle. Good buy.,0.14705882352941177
4494,5.0,"Excellent replacement for the original composite cables for the PS2.

I found myself wanting to replay The Legend of Dragoon.  That game will not work with the component video cables that I had on my PS2.  I ordered this and set the PS2 for composite video output.  It works like a charm.

The PS One classics will need this composite cable.  They will not work if your PS2 only has component cables.

High recommended.",0.15667613636363636

4496,5.0,"Anyone who has played Forza before knows the formula. A great simulation racer with an expansive career mode, and a fun online mode. The car selection is certainly vast, but it pales in comparison to Gran Turismo 5. However, I am not going to make this review comparing the two games. Forza has a lot of things better than GT (and vise versa).

The thing I didn't like too much is that after racing a certain number of times, you can earn manufacturer affinity up to 100%, which basically means you can get all performance parts for free. While this does seem good, it does take away from the concept of racing, earning credits, and making smart purchases considering the amount of money you have.

Also, at a current price of $51.99 it does seem a little too high for my liking. I am sure that in 6 months from now the price will be around $30 or less. Not a big deal, but I felt like I got more out of my money with Forza 3 than with this game.

Don't get me wrong, this is an EXCELLENT GAME and if you are considering buying it, then DO IT!!",0.04155794051627385
4497,5.0,"Using this for rockband on a playstation 4. It works perfectly. The power switch is a nice feature, though it confused my friends at first when the mic didn't pick up for them (they spent some time unplugging it/plugging it back in, rebooting the playstation etc).
It's a little larger than the other rockband mics and feels a little better as well.",0.19791666666666666
4498,5.0,It works and appears to be the official controller. It was able to charge in about 2 hours. The only thing was that it didn't come with a charging cord like I thought. It didn't say it came with one but I was surprised it didn't. I got three of these controllers for my family and I have 1 cord to charge all 4 controllers with. The only thing that was in the box other than the controller was the manual. Seems like good quality.,0.09682539682539683
4499,5.0,"While i was not a huge fan of the 1st red faction, i absolutly love the 2nd one. I was skeptic on buying this game because of all the complaints so i rented it, but now won't hesitate to make the purchase. I realized the only people that were crying and butt-hurt were people who wanted another sandbox game so they can put a 100hrs into this and explore under every nook and cranny, turn over every little rock they stumble upon. I guess i just don't have the time and or patience for that and get bored. This game is action packed, fast and stealthy. I have logged 6 1/2 hrs into it and im 53% through the single player campaign (thats super rushing through it since its a rental). I love how smooth the game plays, the arsenal of weapons is excellent and so are the upgrades. Graphics are top-notch as well as the sound. I have no complaints whatsover on this one and think its an excellent shooter. and yes, you can still knock down and destory 99% of things you come across, everything can be taken down as it can be re-built.",0.03811050061050061
